Certainly not because they were familiar with or cared about what Joe Biden has really spent his career in politics doing.<br></p><p>They elected a former senator <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/joe-biden-didn-t-just-compromise-segregationists-he-fought-their-n1021626\">who fought tirelessly to prevent schools from integrating</a>. His own eventual VP pick was prevented from integrating.

Not surprising from <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/politics/joe-biden/five-quotes-from-joe-bidens-eulogy-of-famed-republ/\">a senator that eulogized Strom Thurmond</a>, one of the most deplored racists in US Senate history.<br></p><p>Movement progressivism seemed to evince a broad-based will to entirely defund the police in 2020 over allegations of intractable systemic racism.

These people turned black bodies into commodities in America all over again.<br></p><h2>2. Sexist - He doesn’t respect women or their boundaries</h2><p>The next-loudest lament of Donald Trump in the White House, is that he’s a sexist, woman-hating, serial abuser of women, maybe even a rapist.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There’s no way to be certain, but probably 99% of <a href=\"https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-misogny-timeline/\">words spent smearing Trump as a sexist are absolute bovine excrement</a>, like hyperventilating over harmless, obviously jokes about his own family members, or meanly joking about people’s looks. Maybe that’s inappropriate or mean-spirited, but it’s only sexist if you’re suggesting that a woman’s looks are more important about her than a man’s are about him, and therefore especially egregious to attack (which is sexist).<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FsxA5qjUjs\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FsxA5qjUjs\"></iframe></div></figure><p>This is the kind of claptrap we can all do well without in any confrontation with any level of complexity. What’s the point of it in politics? Anyone piling it on to more serious allegations for some sweet, sweet cap on top of their graven image of something to hate today, so they can relish the entire mess all the more, is trivializing abuse they’re posing as advocates against. And themselves creating the reality television dystopia they claim Trump inaugurated.</p><p>As for those <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations\">more serious allegations</a>, none have resulted in any indictments against Donald Trump in a court of law ready to determine the facts. Most never surfaced until October 2016, which unfortunately adds a lot of reasonable doubt about them.<br><br>And there’s a glaring problem with Democrats’ treatment of Trump over these allegations, and their repeated insistence that such serious allegations should be believed over any doubts, even without any evidence, moving as they did on social media channels to convict in their opinion, any man who had been accused of sexual misconduct within minutes or hours of learning someone had said something: Someone made an allegation of sexual assault against Joe Biden while he was running for president in 2020, and it was as credible as any made against Trump.<br>‍<br><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/the-medias-silence-over-joe-bidens-metoo-allegations-is-deafening/\">The same press that drowned Kavanaugh’s nomination and much of Trump’s campaign in saturation coverage of sexual misconduct allegations was deafeningly silent</a> over what Tara Reade had to say about Joe Biden last year. At the time, my fifteen-minute cursory investigation of search data found:</p><blockquote>“This many days after Christine Blasey Ford made her allegations public on Sept 16, 2018, NBCNews.com had published 208 pages referencing her.\"<br></blockquote><blockquote>That’s according to the Google search index of NBC News’ website using the query ‘Christine Blasey Ford,’ and limiting results to those published from Sept 16, 2018 – Oct 17, 2018. Today, NBCNews.com has only two pages referencing Tara Reade.<br></blockquote><blockquote>During those 31 days, the New York Times published 300 pages with references to Ford on its website. But today, the Times has only published six reports. One of them is the New York Times’ executive editor defending the paper for waiting 19 days to make its first report.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, Google has indexed 312 pages on the Washington Post, referencing Christine Blasey Ford in the month following her accusation. But the Post has only published two reports and three op-eds covering what Reade has told us about Joe Biden.”</blockquote><p>Alyssa Milano, the visible leader of the MeToo movement in 2017, seemed to <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/alyssa-milanos-metoo-double-standard-for-joe-biden-is-hilarious/\">undo her work as an advocate for women speaking up about sexual abuse, by subordinating it to partisan politics</a> so a Washington career politician with the same rap sheet as Donald Trump, but a “(D)” next to his name would win. Quoth the duopoly: Look on my works, ye dog faced pony soldiers, and despair.<br></p><h2>3. Anti-Immigrant and Isolationist<br></h2><p>Donald Trump exploded onto the 2016 GOP primary with a shameless pander to American nativists of the Pat Buchanan, Michael Savage, Lou Dobbs, Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders variety. Their audiences ate up the Trump phenomenon, and shock jocks Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones piled on with their gigantic talk radio shows.

So Donald Trump made himself an easy target for one of the Democrats’ favorite accusations since the 60’s of their peers across the aisle in the GOP.<br><br>Early in the primary, he seemed to openly desire this characterization from his opponents. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history\">And Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/politics/2016-election-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-race/index.html\">got it</a> <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/06/07/donald-trump-racism-quotes/\">in heaps</a>.

Yes, <em>what about</em> him? If Joe Biden is half as racist against non-white immigrants as Donald Trump’s critics say 45 was, then something went catastrophically wrong in the Democratic Primary. Shout “whataboutism” at your screen all you want. The record shows Joe Biden is literally worse Donald Trump when it comes to racism against black bodied lives in America, and not any better than him when it comes to non-white immigrants here.<br><br>In terms of public policy with real, direct, and devastating impacts on the lives of people of color in America, Joe Biden is everything Never Trumpers hated Trump for. As Vice President, he was part of an administration that deported more immigrants in its first term than Trump did.<br><br>While Donald Trump used immigration as a hot button issue to win in 2016, his administration actually mellowed out some on deportations. In his first three years, Trump’s ICE deported some 800,000 non-citizens. During that time <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO00/20200109/110349/HHRG-116-GO00-20200109-SD007.pdf\">Obama had deported 1.18 million immigrants</a>.<br><br>Not until he was running for president again did Joe Biden speak out against the mass deportations. In Feb 2020 <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/time-biden-calls-obama-deportations-big-mistake-69010125\">he called the policy “a big mistake.</a> Since taking office, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/migrant-children-border-detained.html\">Biden has sent mixed signals on his resolve and ability to liberalize immigration policy as promised</a>. Conditions <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/13/us/border-detention-conditions/index.html\">for minors at overcrowded migrant detention facilities remain dire</a>. One told a lawyer for the National Center for Youth Law <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-children-detained-in-overcrowded-conditions/\">that they were only allowed to shower once in a week</a>, and only ever saw the sun through a window in the shower facilities.<br></p><h2>4.

And like Trump, he had been preparing for this moment of opportunity his entire career.<br><br>With the help of others, like Tennessee U.S. Sen.

His is a record of pathological, compulsive lying. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/six-times-biden-described-major-events-in-his-life-that-never-happened\">Biden has lied repeatedly about major life events (all bizarre and self-glorifying)</a>. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/lies-and-scandals-what-joe-biden-conveniently-forgets-from-obamas-eight-years\">He lied about the Obama Administration’s record</a> as he ran for president against Trump. He also <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/10/6_biden_lies_about_trumps_covid_response.html#!\">told several lies about the Trump Administration’s coronavirus response</a>.<br></p><h2>7. Egomaniac / Total Narcissist</h2><p>Who needs a robust public policy debate when you have <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/\">an expert-for-hire telling The Atlantic why Donald Trump is a narcissist</a> in his professional psycho-analytic opinion? There’s no sensible way of even documenting here the copious outpouring of social media posts over four years expressing disdain for Trump’s ego and narcissism.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Narcissism or zeal are essentially prerequisites to be interested in running for president. The words and deeds of candidates like Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, and Bernie Sanders could pass muster for zeal. But Joe Biden? <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/03/joe-biden-problem-ego-226566/\">The guy who’s so sure everyone literally wants his hands on them that he’s shockingly oblivious to the personal space of others</a>? As Rich Lowry put it for an article in The Politico:</p><blockquote>“Joe Biden wants us to believe that all his touching speaks to how deeply he cares about other people. It’s really a testament to how much regard he has for himself. As everyone has always known, Biden is prone to weird and wildly over-familiar interactions with women, which are extensively on the record and have been the subject of jocular commentary over the years.”</blockquote><p>The current sitting president of the United States is so self-absorbed in grandiosity, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51648166\">he told voters last year that he was arrested in South Africa while trying to see Nelson Mandela</a>. It was a lie. Andrew Young, then-US ambassador to the UN, travelled with Joe Biden to South Africa, and rebuffed his claim. Then previous Biden statements about the trip were found to contradict his new claims. His campaign had to admit the arrest story was all made up. That’s an ego bigger than the Lone Star state that Biden didn’t flip blue in 2020.<br></p><h2>8. Anti-Science - Made Covid Worse, Or Failed to Save Us</h2><p>Like the charges of racism and sexism, this is another warmed over and served again criticism of politicians branded “(R)” so that it’s easy for the RNCDNC bots to follow along. Over understandable and vital disagreements regarding some of the most complex problems in some of the world’s biggest and most sophisticated systems of human coordination at scale–– in the corporate press Republicans have always been the “anti-science” party.<br></p><p>These stereotypes are getting old. While the young love to embrace them for their plug-and-play ease of use (which feels to them like they’re getting something for nothing, because it lends them the sound of authority to gullible others and the aura of moral ascendancy, all without the effort and pains of critical thinking), these are outdated Boomer memes, and they made a mess when the Boomers traded them. That the policy agenda and methods of culture-making unique to the left as instituted in the actions of the Democratic Party, are somehow free of moralizing or uncompromised by resistance to inconvenient truths is patently ridiculous. <br><br>If it really is, then no one has to tell you that science is on their side, as so many pro-lockdown and mask mandate vocalists brashly trumpeted for the entire last year–– source: <a href=\"https://facebook.com/\">Facebook.com</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter.com</a>. They could just use the facts that support their argument. People who say that are really saying something like, \"God is on my side,\" in the same way, and with the same conviction as Pope Urban II or Osama bin Laden would have said it. Technocratic experts who are almost certainly not free of their own conscious policy and partisan biases and leanings, have joined with corporate media and blue America <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/17/covid-19-us-400-000-deaths-experts-blame-trump-administration/6642685002/\">to claim Trump has 400,000 American deaths on his hands after the events of 2020</a>. That's an editorial, not a scientific discovery.<br></p><p>The scientific method is clear and simple enough in nature. Its fruits are statistical composites of replicable results in experiments that control for confounding variables. The epistemic authority of science is so absolute because it is so greedily, exactingly modest in its pronouncements–– the opposite of the supposed moral authority of students of political “science.” The game they play is a sort of Mad Libs, in which the sentences are constructed to support a radical and unconstitutional political agenda, and the scientific evidence is shoe-horned into the blank spaces under the most tenuous of justifications, or less than that. Wild but understandably tempting inferences from headlines rounded off with a little copy are enough for the bots.<br></p><p>The discussion under this sub-heading is so vitally meta-contextual, that despite the headline of this article, I’m going to leave it unsullied with any further discussion of Trump or Biden.</p><p>For now, that’s all I’ve got to say about that.</p><h2>9. Encouraged Terrorism and Violence</h2><p>The crux of the case against Trump was not merely that his administration would be and was unseemly, indecent, and painfully awkward–– but positively dangerous to human liberty, limb, and life. A Google search for “trump refuses to disavow white supremacists” returns over 100,000 results. Click through to page 10, and you’ll continue to find mainstream news reports piling onto this narrative.<br></p><p>While the reports qualify the specific instances with enough detail, the impression the corporate press has made on voters, wittingly or not (I suspect with the utmost intention), is that Donald Trump has absolutely and entirely refused his entire presidency to condemn white supremacists. This impression is readily apparent from four years of social media timelines. The ocean may as well be pasted into a hyperlink here for reference. But the truth is:<br><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNsexIluqDY\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNsexIluqDY\"></iframe></div></figure><p>As for Joe Biden, he’s just like Donald Trump in this respect. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/07/fact-check-joe-biden-has-condemned-violent-protests-several-times/6576824002/\">While he’s disavowed violence from Antifa and BLM protestors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2020/09/05/Ben-Shapiro-Why-won-t-Biden-condemn-Antifa-or-BLM-violence/stories/202009050012\">despite partisan claims that he hasn’t, he’s also inflamed and stoked racial and political tensions</a>, ostensibly for electioneering reasons–– the ultimate motivation of most politicians if not the immediately proximate one.<br><br>As for encouraging violence, Joe Biden supporters should ask themselves honestly what makes them more sick, <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/another-tea-party-is-brewing-this-one-will-be-stormier\">the Jan 2020 riot at the Capitol</a>, that they say Trump directly incited with a standard “Go, fight, win” political stump speech–– or the 2003 invasion of Iraq, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War#:~:text=The%20Iraq%20Body%20Count%20project%20(IBC)%20figure%20of%20documented%20civilian,violence%20and%20increased%20criminal%20violence.\">violence which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians</a>, and that Joe Biden not only encouraged with speeches on the floor of the Senate, but directly enabled with his vote.<br><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LsVArjbxT0\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LsVArjbxT0\"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍<br></p><h2>10. Too Franly with Vladimir Putin and Russia</h2><p>For four years straight <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/03/06/biggest-scandal-since-watergate\">American voters were promised the biggest scandal since Watergate</a> on the verge of breaking. We were strung along through this conspiracy theorizing worthy of the likes of Alex Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/28/trump-russia-investigation-mueller-liberal-media-rachel-maddow\">but on corporate MSNBC, not indy Internet media</a>. The money was good for them, but the overblown hysterics, actual post-truth political commentary, and endless distraction has yet to show any progress for public policy or basic humanity and decency.<br><br>If Democrats were as careful in scrutinizing Joe Biden’s tangles with foreign heads of state, they’d have to reckon with Ukraine. There was no dearth of words for this affair in 2019-20, as it was for the Russia-Trump collusion investigation. Most of it was boring and hard to follow even for wonky politicos. But <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/03/what-really-happened-when-biden-forced-out-ukraines-top-prosecutor/3785620002/\">USA Today cut through the noise with a succinct summary</a>:<br></p><blockquote>“At the heart of Congress’ probe into the president’s actions is his claim that former Vice President and 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.”<br></blockquote><p>The paper noted:<br></p><blockquote>“Critics of Hunter Biden have questioned how he landed such a lucrative role with no experience in Ukraine or the gas industry.”</blockquote><p>There was no smoking gun here in the end, but neither was there from the anti-Trump crowd’s endless fascination with Russia collusion conspiracy theories. And there certainly was blatant nepotism on display for someone to have such a lucrative opportunity in a country where his ranking US&nbsp;politician father had so much clout. So there’s a bonus likeness for anyone who loved to hate Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Donald Jr, for being their father’s children and going with him to Washington.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>What anti-Trump howlers thought they looked like for four years:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIE-5hg7FoA\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zIE-5hg7FoA\"></iframe></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIE-5hg7FoA\">‍<br></a>What they looked like to me:<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvGmOZ5T6_Y\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvGmOZ5T6_Y\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Somehow Democrats managed to get 81 million voters to vote for a candidate that showed every sign of being as bad as Trump in the very ways that made them say they deplore Trump. So did they really deplore Trump after all? Or was the outrage as phony as Trump would say the news was fake? If it was real, then why did they nominate Joe Biden and elect him president?</p><p>The theory that it was a failure by design looks increasingly valid the deeper our polity unfolds into the digital archive. These troubling incongruences appear more and more every month, every year to be a designed failure of the most trusted brand name influencers in two party politics, news journalism, and social media. Biden’s election was merely the latest in the two-party establishment’s intentional, systemic failure to educate voters about candidates and policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, it was a failure of the individuals who use these sources and platforms to educate and inform themselves about politics. Those who opine about politics have taken upon themselves a moral obligation to be critical thinkers. Few take this seriously.</p><p>I didn’t waste your time with exaggerations or spurious arguments–– that is, fake news. Take a look around.&nbsp;There's nothing in Syria looks any different to me. Nor on the border with Mexico. The slogans are replaced, by-the-bye, and the parting on the right is now parting on the left.<br><br>2020 was a weird year.

There are reports that the former president is intending to play a role in the 2022 election. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-republican-split/2021/01/23/d7dc253e-5cbc-11eb-8bcf-3877871c819d_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">One report</a> says his hit list includes Rep.

Rather than support opponents in the general elections against the Democrats who harried him, the former president wants to use the 2022 primaries to get back at legislators who were insufficiently obedient.</p><p>None of this should be surprising. One of the hallmarks of Trump’s presidency was his predilection for trying to exact retribution through primaries. During his presidency, he goaded #MAGA candidates to challenge senators and congressmen who dared to publicly disagree. Remember Arizona Senator <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/flake-admits-i-couldn-t-win-gop-primary-be-proud-n814111\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Flake</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republican-senator-from-tennessee-announces-his-retirement/2017/09/26/df106d96-a2f3-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Corker</a>? They are just two of the GOP legislators who crossed Trump and then chose not to run the primary reelection gauntlet. Most infamously, on January 6, Trump threatened to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/06/they-will-get-primaried-trump-allies-threaten-republicans-who-wont-object-to-electoral-college/?sh=11f555571855\" target=\"_blank\">“primary the Hell”</a> out of any legislator who refused to try to thwart the counting of states’ electoral slates.</p><p>That the electoral primary has become a weapon of an aggrieved former president is a remarkable development. But for those elections observers who have been complaining about primaries for the past couple decades, it likely is no surprise.</p><p>The partisan primary, wherein each party allows only its registered voters to participate, came into vogue a century ago. It was a progressive reform that toppled the old system that had Democratic and Republican party bosses picking their candidates. Letting party members pick their candidate was much more democratic and likely reduced some of the corruption that occurred in the proverbial smoke-filled backrooms. A recent <a href=\"https://openprimarieseducationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ROI_Report_R1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by the Open Primaries Education Fund notes:</p><blockquote>“The American system of primary elections worked, because most Americans were members of one of the two major political parties and had access to them as a result of the overlap between voter and party registration. From 1940 to 1960, independent voters hovered between 15% and 20% of all registered voters. In 1961, 80% of Americans were members of either the Democrat or Republican parties.”</blockquote><p>Reality, however, has moved on, and partisan primaries have developed into anti-democratic and elitist purity tests for candidates. Those who fail particular litmus tests on abortion, guns, or fealty to Donald Trump may find themselves defeated.</p><p>The causes are twofold.</p><p>First, many Americans have grown weary of the two parties. Today, <a href=\"https://openprimarieseducationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ROI_Report_R1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">40 percent</a> of Americans are independents, and in <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> states they are forbidden from voting in primary elections. The reader would be wrong to imagine this exclusionary policy was the province of the GOP. Both parties like closed primaries, which exist in red states like Kentucky and blue states like New York.</p><p>Second, <a href=\"https://www.electproject.org/2020p\" target=\"_blank\">astonishingly few</a> voters participate in primaries. Typically, somewhere between 20 and 35 percent of those eligible to vote in the Democratic and Republican primaries do so. And these are not low-stakes races like local dog catcher — these abysmal participation rates are for congressional and presidential elections. The few who turnout naturally tend to be the most intensely partisan and single-issue voters.</p><p>The effects on Congress are plain for all to see. Legislators fear working across party lines on any issues that might tick off their most passionate voters. Republicans refuse to cut a deal on immigration that looks like “amnesty” and Democrats flee any talk of reigning in entitlements, which consume about <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56991\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent</a> of the budget. Many legislators want to reach compromises on pressing issues like these, but they don’t. Nobody wants to get primaried.</p><p>There is, obviously, a way out. The parties could open their primaries to independents. <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Some states</a>, such as West Virginia, have made this reform. <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Other states</a>, like North Dakota, have open primaries that permit anyone to vote in the primaries.</p><p>In the meantime, the primaries trap draws tighter on GOP legislators, as Donald Trump plots his moves.</p><p>‍</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinrkosar\"><em>Kevin Kosar</em></a><em> is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.</em></p>","name":"Legislators Feel Caught in the Trap of Partisan Primaries","teaser":"What is next for Donald Trump?

Phil Murphy's announcement Monday that the state's longtime reliance on in-person voting will resume for school board elections in April, municipal contests in May and probably the gubernatorial and legislative primaries in June.</p><p>The decision to conduct last fall's general election mainly by mail created more of a ruckus, but also more of a difference in civic participation, than in any other place that made a similar change.</p><p>The switch heralded a blizzard of criticism from voters worried about entrusting their ballots to the Postal Service, many of whom insisted on showing up at local polling stations that were supposed to be used only by the physically didabled — and furious about reports of bureaucratic snafus, including the use of outdated lists to send some ballots to dead people and multiple ballots to living people.</p><p>The system also had to endure a lawsuit from the Trump campaign, which argued the Democratic governor exceeded his authority by decreeing the alternate system. But, in the end, it seemed to work best for the Republicans.</p><p>Voters crushed the state's turnout record — 77 percent of eligible New Jerseyans cast a ballot, fully 10 points better than the nation as whole — even as the numbers voting in Democratic urban strongholds slipped while the share of people voting in GOP-friendly suburban counties soared. The results were higher-than-usual percentages for some Republican congressional candidates, although no seats changed hands. And President Biden carried the state's 14 electoral votes by 16 points, a similar margin to other recent Democratic nominees.</p><p>In the end, 86 percent of New Jersey ballots were cast using envelopes, one of the highest shares in the nation. Four years ago the number was 7 percent, one of the smallest percentages.</p><p>The local contests in the spring usually generate minimal turnout. And there is not much suspense ahead of the June primaries, when Murphy's nomination for a second term is assured and so is that of his GOP challenger, former state Rep. Jack Ciatarelli.</p><p>Murphy said he was \"optimistic\" that vaccination rates and declining Covid cases will allow in-person voting in June, but for now his decision only applies to the first two elections.</p><p>\"As always, voters will have the availability to request a vote-by-mail ballot for any reason,\" he said. \"We will ensure that all in person polling places adhere to safety protocols, including face covering, social distancing and frequent sanitation.\"</p><p>Similar turnout boosts marked the 2020 elections in the other five places that for the first time sent all registered voters an absentee ballot: California, Nevada, Vermont, almost all of Montana and Washington, D.C. None of them has decided for sure what their election systems will be for 2022 or beyond. New Jersey was pressed to make a decision because it and Virginia are the only states with elections for governor and the legislature this year.</p>","name":"New Jersey The First State to Reverse COVID-Inspired Swith to Vote-by-Mail","teaser":"New Jersey has become the first state to back away from a pandemic-driven switch to conducting elections almost entirely remotely.","hero":{"fileId":"602405e4ba49adadfa268d0e","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/602405e4ba49adadfa268d0e_nj-capitol.jpg","alt":null},"slug":"new-jersey-the-first-state-to-reverse-covid-inspired-swith-to-vote-by-mail","author-s":["5ee7a38fe6813bdcc08b0526"],"topics-new":"5e34670b78b3337cb48c0900","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","updated-on":"2021-02-10T16:12:41.545Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2021-02-10T16:12:41.545Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2021-02-10T16:12:41.545Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"602405f9c4c45f0001f9af25"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"media":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPExKRDg4po&feature=youtu.be","metadata":{"width":854,"height":480,"html":"<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwPExKRDg4po%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwPExKRDg4po&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FwPExKRDg4po%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"YouTube embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>","aspectRatio":0,"title":"#06 What the Heck is LIBERTARIANISM?

And if our preferred choice fails to deliver quality service, we want the freedom to take our business somewhere else.<br></p><p>Now, it may be that within an industry, one or two dominant entities emerge and consumers simply prefer these entities. However, the existence of competition incentivizes the dominant entities to continue to listen and respond to consumer demand.<br></p><p>Amazon, for instance, cannot get complacent or else it will lose customers. And, the next Amazon could emerge and become the dominant entity within the industry. Thus, emergence or existence of competition inevitably impacts the evolution of the biggest companies in any industry.<br></p><p>That is how a free market ideally is supposed to work, and the same could be said for the political process. However, there is something inherently wrong with the way the US political system operates, because elected officials are no longer responsive to voters’ demands.<br></p><p>Why? Well, consider the following analogy:<br></p><p>Imagine going out to dinner but there are only two restaurant options from which to choose. The customer service may be sloppy in both, and no matter how much a customer raises grievances with the limited options on the menu, nothing changes. Instead of adapting their business practices to an evolving consumer base, they increasingly distance themselves from the interests of consumers.<br></p><p>What’s worse, employees of these two restaurants also write the rules and regulations that govern the service industry and other employees enforce the rules.</p><p>Sounds crazy, right? Why would we ever allow this to happen? Well, this is essentially the situation of the US political system.<br></p><p>I touched on this a bit in a piece on <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/the-conversation-on-election-integrity-neither-party-wants-you-to-hear\">election integrity</a>. The entire electoral process has been designed to give an advantage to the two major parties and their members. This advantage extends to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Taxpayer-funded primaries,&nbsp;</li><li>How election districts are drawn,&nbsp;</li><li>Who is allowed on the ballot,&nbsp;</li><li>Who can raise money and how much;&nbsp;</li><li>Who gets voter data;&nbsp;</li><li>Who gets to debate;&nbsp;</li><li>how election laws are enforced&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And, the advantages continue from there.</p><h2>Partisan Primaries<br></h2><p>Consider from the onset of elections, voters are told to pick a side in partisan primaries. In several cases, the condition to vote in these taxpayer-funded elections is conditioned on being a registered member of one of the two major parties.<br></p><p>Voters are also <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/the-great-migration-americas-growing-exodus-away-from-political-parties\">warned by election administrators</a> in several states that failing to join a party will lead to restrictions at the ballot box. In other words, public officials use taxpayer-funded channels to advocate for the membership of private political parties.</p><p>Due to how districts are drawn or the natural advantage one party has in an area, most elections are safe for either the Republican or Democratic Party. This means the most critical decision voters make is in the primary, where the nominee of the political majority is chosen.<br></p><p>As a result of closed and semi-closed primary rules in several states, tens of millions of voters are denied a meaningful voice in the process because they do not want to affiliate with either of the major parties. In <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/the-great-migration-americas-growing-exodus-away-from-political-parties\">half the states</a> that register voters by party, independents outnumber members of at least one of the two major parties. There are also many states where independents outnumber registered members of both major parties.<br></p><p>And, when pro-voter advocates have <a href=\"https://independentvoterproject.org/work/opening-new-jerseys-primary\">challenged</a> the use of elections that give party members an extra say in who ultimately is elected at the expense of equal voting rights for all voters, courts have to date sided with the argument that voters should join a party or don’t vote.<br></p><p>Partisan primaries are where the askewness of the incentive structure in politics stars to become apparent. Due to the outsized advantage these low-turnout elections have in determining the outcome, public officials’ approach to legislation is to appease the extreme minority that participate in extremely partisan elections.<br></p><p>Voters may have heard the term “being primaried.” The biggest fear most policymakers have is not losing the general election, but having to defend their seat from a strong primary challenger - a challenger who could garner support from party leaders.<br></p><p>Thus, to protect their status with party leaders, which could impact access to party resources and voter data, many of the people in charge of writing and implementing policy are encouraged to never work with the “other side” and toe whatever the current party line is.</p><p>The consequence of partisan primaries is an extreme minority of voters and party leaders have an outsized advantage in deciding who ultimately gets elected to positions of power. The rest of the electorate is expected to just accept what they have been given by the partisan powers that be.</p><h2>Partisan Gerrymandering</h2><p>Anti-gerrymandering campaigns have made great strides over the years in order to take control of drawing electoral districts out of the hands of public officials loyal to their parties first. Still, the maps drawn in <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/despite-reform-gains-partisan-interests-still-largely-control-redistricting-process\">2021 will largely favor partisan interests</a>.<br></p><p>Partisan gerrymandering is the most well-known scheme by both parties to maintain their respective majorities in states across the country. The parties crack and pack communities to ensure most districts are safe for their candidates. Even when the majority is slim, this power to draw electoral districts can lead to one party having a supermajority or near-supermajority of seats. </p><p>The result of how districts have been drawn has resulted in some oddly-shaped districts in the past, like the infamous “Goofy Kicking Donald Duck” district in Pennsylvania, a district that prior to a <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling</a> in 2018 and subsequent re-mapping of the state’s congressional districts was held together in one spot by a single crab shack (not kidding).</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/601c4f3dc41933c9313bf8a2_5b75cf8110ee9.image.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Gerrymandering is largely viewed as a Republican scheme, but that is due to the fact that they have an overwhelming advantage. The GOP has once again won unmitigated control over redistricting in 21 states versus the 9 states where Democrats control the process.<br></p><p>Still, it is important to note that this scheme to protect and enhance majority control over state legislatures is not limited to a single party. Republicans scheme to draw maps that benefit them in states like Texas just as hard as Democrats scheme to draw maps that benefit them in states like Maryland.</p><p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://thefulcrum.us/new-york-redistricting\">first partisan gerrymandering win</a> of 2021 was in New York, where the Democratic-controlled legislature quietly approved a ballot measure for November that would essentially give Democrats unilateral authority to accept or reject an independent redistricting commission that exists only in an advisory role.<br></p><p>The gains anti-gerrymandering reformers have made over the years, including passing anti-gerrymandering initiatives in 4 states at the ballot box in 2018, are significant, but they are also still marginal when compared to where parties still have control over the process, and as reformers build on their successes, the parties further scheme to overturn these pro-voter gains.<br></p><p>In 2018, for instance, passed a comprehensive good governance package that included independent redistricting. However, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-voter-dump-redistricting-reform-a9e177612d135176ff53718b9b0e5436\">ballot measure</a> spearheaded by partisan interests in the state, convinced voters in 2020 to eliminate key provisions in the reform and handed the process back to party loyalists.<br></p><p>The parties don’t like it when voters try to usurp their authority over the electoral process, because in their mind, they are entitled to elections. Voters take a back seat to the will of the party leaders.</p><h2>Ballot Access</h2><p>Minor parties have made some strides in the last few years on the ballot access front in presidential elections. For instance, the Green Party and Libertarian nominees for president in 2016 and 2020 were on all or most state ballots.<br></p><p>Still, the obstacles in certain states for third party and independent candidates to make it on the ballot seem insurmountable -- so much so that candidates outside the major parties often see no incentive to run.<br></p><p>In Georgia, a state that has received national notoriety for its elevated role in determining how the ebb and flow of political power in Washington sways, for instance, requires valid signatures from 5% of registered voters for US House and state legislature.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In modern history, the only time minor party and independent candidates have been in these elections is as write-in candidates as a result.<br></p><p>Illinois requires candidate petitions for the US House, state legislature, and county partisan office to receive 5% of the last vote cast. In Pennsylvania, a minor party must have a membership of 15% of the registered voting population to qualify for the ballot. In Virginia, a minor party has to get 10% of the vote in any statewide race in one of the previous two election cycles.<br></p><p>These are just a few examples where the bar to get on the ballot is substantially higher than it is for major party candidates who only have to get a few dozen signatures in many cases to appear on the primary ballot, and get marginal support from voters to advance to the general election.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>The challenge for minor party and independent candidates is not always meeting the signature requirement. It is the challenge the major parties pose, both legally and legislatively, when candidates outside the duopoly start to make inroads.<br></p><p>In Arizona, another state that has gained national notoriety, the Republican-controlled legislature <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/06/29/arizona-gop-war-libertarian-party/\">changed the ballot access laws in 2015</a> to stave off the Libertarian Party by changing the requirement to get on the party’s primary ballot from being based on party registration to total state voter registration.<br></p><p>In 2018, this required Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Kevin McCormick to 3,152 signatures to appear on his own party’s primary ballot instead of the 133 required prior to the 2015 law. Still, McCormick’s campaign managed to turn in enough signatures, yet ended up still getting removed from the primary ballot.<br></p><p>Arizona GOP Chair Jonathan Lines challenged the legitimacy of <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/06/15/arizona-gop-tries-rob-libertarian-kevin-mccormick-ballot-spot/\">over 90 percent of his ballot signatures</a>, and the state’s largest county - Maricopa County - tossed 500 of the signatures gathered, which ended up costing McCormick gravely.<br></p><p>The most detrimental challenge to McCormick targeted the party affiliation of the voters who signed McCormic’s petition. State law states a party candidate cannot garner signatures from voters registered with another party, even though the new signature requirement on Libertarian candidates factored in the total registered voting population.<br></p><p>McCormick was not alone in being challenged in 2018. In total, there were 30 candidate petition challenges, according to the Arizona secretary of state’s office. In 18 of those cases, including McCormick,&nbsp; the candidate either withdrew or was removed from the ballot.<br></p><p>This does not even get into the numerous legal challenges to minor party and independent petitions for ballot access that have occurred across the country, and in many cases the major parties end up winning a battle of attrition because they have the money and resources to outlast outside candidates who spend most of their resources just to get on the ballot.<br></p><p>When they have nothing left to defend their spot on the ballot, alternative options end up dropping out.</p><h2>Exclusionary Debates</h2><p>Public debates and forums can be a way for the public to be introduced to alternative options to the Republican and Democratic Parties. They can also be a means by which new and innovative ideas and solutions can enter the electoral narrative.<br></p><p>However, the grip that the major parties have on elections extends to the debates and the national narrative. Nowhere are the bipartisan machinations to keep new faces and ideas out of the spotlight more apparent than the presidential debates.<br></p><p>The major parties partnered together to establish the <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-commission-on-presidential-debates\">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> in 1987, a move that essentially muscled out the League of Women Voters as sponsors of the debate. The League said it “no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.”<br></p><p>And a hoodwinking indeed followed. Since the Commission took over debate sponsorship, three candidates have shared the debate stage only one time -- Ross Perot in 1992. In 2000, the debate commission changed its rules, the most notable change being a 15% rule that required candidates to poll at 15% or higher in 5 nationwide polls handpicked by the Commission to qualify for the debate.<br></p><p>Not only did the new rule make it impossible for 2000 Green Party candidate Ralph Nader to be heard on the debate stage, but the Commission had Nader forcibly removed from the same campus the Bush-Gore debate was held where he attempted to watch the debate in a separate auditorium.<br></p><p>Nader had a ticket for the event, but the Commission on Presidential Debates did not want a third party candidate anywhere near a show that they have deemed is solely about endorsing the major party candidates.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This was not an isolated incident. In 2012, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and her running mate were arrested for attempting to enter the debate grounds.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Fifteen percent in 5 polls is a tall order for any third party or independent candidate. It’s a feat that must be accomplished even as pollsters bury their names, the media ignores them, and as previously mentioned, they have to spend all of their resources just to gain and keep ballot access.</p><p>The 15% rule has exacerbated the lack of competition in US elections as many potential independent and third party candidates have <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/independent-voter-project-files-brief-supporting-lawsuit-against-bipartisan-debate-commission\">cited it</a> as a reason why they won’t run for president, despite viable credentials and experience in public office.</p><p>The FEC was asked to address the clear bias the Commission on Presidential Debates. The FEC shot down administration complaints, which <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/269400519/Level-the-Playing-Field-et-al-v-FEC?campaign=VigLink&ad_group=xxc1xx&source=hp_affiliate&medium=affiliate&campaign=VigLink&ad_group=xxc1xx&source=hp_affiliate&medium=affiliate\">led to a lawsuit in 2015</a>. Despite some early victories in court, the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge, and a petition filed with the Supreme Court has yet to be taken up.</p><p>The fight against the rigged electoral rules that deny voters competitive elections in the US has long been an uphill battle. After all, those who challenge the status quo are challenging rules put in place explicitly to benefit the major parties. </p><p>The two parties hijacked the presidential debates so they could apply the same control over them they have over every other facet of the electoral process.</p><h2>It Doesn’t End There (Far From It)<br></h2><p>These are just a few examples of the ways the US political process has been manufactured to serve the private interests of two political corporations, the Republican and Democratic Parties:</p><ul><li>This doesn’t get into the impact winner-take-all, at-large elections have on disproportionate and inadequate representation.&nbsp;</li><li>This doesn’t get into a first-past-the-post choose-one voting method that allows candidates to win elections with the consent of a political minority.&nbsp;</li><li>This doesn’t get into how the organizations that control the biggest flow of money and voter data in the nation are the two major parties.</li><li>This doesn’t get into ways the major party leaders have intentionally and maliciously marginalized or destroyed campaigns within their own parties that might have massive appeal among voters, but refuse to toe the party line or stick to the partisan script.</li><li>This doesn’t get into how the agency charged with enforcing federal election and campaign corruption laws, the FEC, is intentionally split evenly between Republicans and Democrats so the agency can’t AND won’t move on anything.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For decades, the rules and regulations that govern the entire electoral process in states across the country and at the federal level have been written by public officials loyal to their parties, and it extends to every level of the electoral process.<br></p><p>There is a reason why the number of elected officials outside the major parties in the US House of Representatives dropped from 41 in the Progressive Era (1911-1960) to 6 in the modern era, and only two of those elected officials were elected as an independent or minor party candidate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s right: <em>two</em> in the last 60 years. (Note: This does not include the US Senate.)<br></p><p>There is also a reason why Congress has become largely unresponsive to voters at-large, and the nation’s policy is trapped in a state of paralysis. Because elections, top-down, have become solely about “Team Red” and “Team Blue,” and who wins.<br></p><p>In a monopoly (and in this case a duopoly), when an industry is locked down for one or two entities, the consumer doesn’t really matter, because where is the consumer going to go, especially if the entity provides a critical service?<br></p><p>The entities in a monopoly or duopoly only have to be accountable to themselves, and while a duopoly allows one additional option, when both options fail to meet the needs of the public, consumers are left bouncing between the two sides and hoping something eventually changes.<br></p><p>In the US, many consumers experience another monopoly on a daily basis. It, however, is a more region-specific monopoly. I am talking about consumer options for Internet Service Providers.<br></p><p>Many Americans know what it is like to only have one or two options when it comes to broadband access (if they get that at all), even when it is not the best quality that exists in the broader market or the companies put the interests of consumers first.</p><p>In fact, the similarities between the two-party duopoly and the ISP monopolies in the US are striking. According to Community Networks:<br></p><blockquote>“The big telecom companies have largely abandoned rural America — their DSL networks overwhelmingly do not support broadband speeds — despite many billions spent over years of federal subsidies and many state grant programs.”<br></blockquote><p>And, approximately 83.3 million Americans, <a href=\"https://ilsr.org/report-most-americans-have-no-real-choice-in-internet-providers/\">according to the Institute for Local Self Reliance</a>, can only access broadband through a single provider.<br></p><p>You know who else has largely abandoned the needs of rural America? The major parties, despite public support in one way or another.<br></p><p>We don’t find this acceptable. In fact, it angers millions of Americans that their options are so limited. We should be even more angered by the reality that the people we elect to represent us, to serve the public interest, and provide for the general welfare, don’t.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>The public interest takes a backseat to party loyalty.</strong><br></p><p>And, in the zero-sum contest between the Republican and Democratic Parties, the only thing that matters is who wins, even if it means sacrificing voters’ rights, voters’ choice, accountability, ethics, etc. What won’t either side say to get an advantage or get voters to hate the “other side”?<br></p><p>Division, anger, frustration, and fear define US elections, and the parties and their allies in the media want voters to believe that the state of things is normal, because it is good for business. It doesn’t matter where it has taken our country. It doesn’t matter how hyper-polarization has boiled over. And we are seeing the consequences of this play out in ways like never before in modern history.<br></p><p>As we wrap up, consider this question: What have the parties <em>actually</em> learned from the chaos and insurrection at the capitol on January 6? Who is really being held accountable for fostering such extreme hyper-polarized division? Who has helped build a political environment where this has even been possible to emerge?<br></p><p>Now, answer this: Are you fed</p>","name":"What The Heck Is The Two-Party Duopoly?","slug":"what-the-heck-is-the-two-party-duopoly","author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","topics-new":"5d2cdfbcf786224ea62087b7","updated-on":"2021-02-09T15:35:47.846Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2021-02-04T19:49:43.957Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2021-02-10T16:13:36.465Z","published-by":"Person_5aba858c60e60012c4d044f0","hero":{"fileId":"5d5dacbdc39c763fc6e5b8d7","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d5dacbdc39c763fc6e5b8d7_shutterstock_114868483-860x430.jpg","alt":null},"teaser":"What is the duopoly?

It would build off work done by a similar election commission created in 2013 under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Ideally the Biden administration would form this new commission as soon as possible so its members could make recommendations ahead of the 2022 midterms.

Members would also reflect a diverse set of racial and ethnic groups since marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by election disinformation and voter intimidation, according to the report.

San Diego voters will soon be able to track and analyze the campaign contributions and independent expenditures of local political campaigns with an online dashboard created by a coalition of non-partisan political reform organizations.</p><p>While campaign finance information has always been available to the public, it is hard for the less than tech-savvy individual to make sense of the numerous spreadsheets and PDF files it is stored in, Amy Tobia, co-leader of Represent San Diego, a local branch of the national RepresentUs democracy reform movement, explained. This difficulty effectively prevents the public from accessing the available information. “Without transparency there can be no accountability, and distrust grows,” she added.</p><p>By way of a point-and-click interface, the <a href=\"https://followthemoneysandiego.org/\">San Diego Voters’ Voice Initiative Dashboard</a> gives voters easy access to financial information stored in City of San Diego public records. When launched in the Spring of 2021, it will display the financial information candidates report as they ramp up their 2022 campaigns. The organizations behind the dashboard are <a href=\"https://opensandiego.org/\">Open San Diego</a>, <a href=\"https://represent.us/\">RepresentUs</a>, <a href=\"https://lwvc.org/\">League of Women Voters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.commoncause.org/\">Common Cause</a>.</p><blockquote>\"Without transparency there can be no accountability, and distrust grows.\" - Amy Tobia</blockquote><p>“The thinking is the more information that voters have on candidates, the better choices they can make,” Dominic Gerace, lead UX designer on the project, said. He offered as an example knowing whether candidates take in more money from outside sources than from sources within San Diego.</p><p>The Voter’s Voice Initiative Dashboard displays information about campaigns for mayor, city council and city attorney. Users select the office they are interested in and drill down to see information about the candidates for that office. Information includes money raised vs. money spent, donations by group, in-city vs. out-of-city contributions and total number of contributors.</p><p>Inspired by a similar online resource created by <a href=\"https://openoakland.org/\">OpenOakland</a> called <a href=\"https://www.opendisclosure.io/\">Open Disclosure</a>, the Voters’ Voice Initiative Dashboard was developed at minimal expense by a revolving team of volunteer software engineers, data scientists and designers. Voters’ Voice hopes the City of San Diego will eventually take over managing it.&nbsp;</p><p>The initial launch of the Dashboard will be followed by further development to make it easy for other cities and states to adapt it to their own use. “We want to make sure that they can take what we’ve built and make it fit their local needs,” Gerace said.</p><p>Further plans also include data visualizations that display information about which parts of the county contribute the most in elections, which industries fund campaigns most and where money originates and is spent.</p><p>The San Diego Voters’ Voice Transparency Dashboard is one of only a handful of platforms to provide voters easy access to campaign finance information.

Justice Roberts put the lie to that when he signaled that he would not preside because it was not, constitutionally speaking, an impeachment, as Trump was no longer in office. Moreover, if anything, the impeachment will keep Trump’s base engaged and in sympathy with their leader.&nbsp;</p><p>It has become clear that there is not even close to the 2/3 majority needed in the Senate to vote to convict. While the House vote to impeach helped the Democrats shape the post capitol incursion, post inaugural narrative, it has left the Democratic leadership “all dressed up with nowhere to go.”&nbsp;At his point, the Democrats, with Biden’s reluctant acquiescence, may be forced to go forward with a “trial” that most Americans will view as wasting energy and political capital needed to address the pandemic, the economy, the middle east, China etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As for Republicans, it is clear they are not done with Trump. Their political viability depends on the populist Trump base and for now, at least, they cannot hold that base and dump Trump, Mitch McConnell’s desires notwithstanding. Moreover, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and others view Trump’s base as their own.</p><p>There are surely good reasons to prevent a second Trump presidency. The country survived one term; can it survive another? There is an approach that can impede Trump and improve our democracy.&nbsp;For it to become more than an abstract argument by a reform-minded activist-lawyer will require buy-in by elements of both major parties or sufficient funds to take it directly “to the people.”</p><p>The approach calls for defending and expanding open primaries. Open primaries can take several forms. First there is top-two where all candidates and voters participate in a first round with the top two vote getters going on to the November elections. Most top-two systems allow candidates to list their party preference or affiliation.&nbsp;California, Washington State and Louisiana use the top two system. In other states, partisan primaries remain, but a voter is allowed to choose the primary she or he seeks to vote in.&nbsp;This is used in non-partisan registration states such as South Carolina, Wisconsin and Virginia.</p><p>Trump’s immediate strategy appears to be to remain in the Republican Party and seek to support as many winning candidates in the 2022 congressional primaries as possible. Such a strategy is most effective in a closed primary system where only Republicans can vote. Indeed, pro-Trump Republicans in Missouri, New Hampshire, Virginia and South Carolina are working to close their states’ primary elections. The success of Trump’s strategy will provide a measure of his strength in the Republican Party and the prospects for those aligned with him.</p><p>Reform advocates, particularly those in IndependentVoting.org and OpenPrimaries.org, are fighting these efforts to close the primaries. Can they convince anti-Trump Republicans and Democrats to join with them to keep the primaries open? This is not the ideal scenario for partisans on either side, but if they are sincere about stopping Trump, they would be hard pressed (or at least exposed) if they failed to do so.&nbsp; If “anybody but Trump” elected Biden, can “anything but Trump” be so easily rejected?</p><p>Open primaries would force Trump, and other candidates, to demonstrate their appeal to the electorate at large in order to advance to the general election. It makes it much more difficult for a candidate (like Trump in 2016) to assemble a solid core of 30 percent or so of a party’s voters and ride this to the nomination.&nbsp;Trump bested eleven other Republican candidates with this divide and conquer strategy.&nbsp;He went from a plurality choice of Republicans to a narrow electoral college win over Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote.</p><p>The best antidote to Trump and Trumpism is more democracy.

The political narrative is more hyper-polarized than at any other point in modern American history. The parties are more divided, and as a result the electoral landscape is more divided.<br></p><p>The state of hyper-polarization and division is at the forefront of the American psyche, particularly after the riots and violence at the US Capitol on January 6 and the commencement of an impeachment trial of a former president.<br></p><p>Gallup <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/328754/americans-concern-grows-government-national-discord.aspx\">found</a> that between December 2020 and January 2021 the percentage of Americans who thought the government, its leaders, and their behavior was the biggest challenge facing the US jumped 9 points from 20% to 29% -- surpassing the coronavirus for the first time since June.<br></p><p>Further, the polling agency reports that the percentage of people who said political division was the number one challenge facing the country hit 12%, which may not seem like a lot, but is the highest recorded in the survey’s 7-decade history and jumped 5 points from December.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/biden_administration/voters_say_u_s_is_more_divided_doubt_biden_can_unite_americans\">Rasmussen also found</a> that 56% of Americans believe the US has become more divided since the 2020 election. And, despite President Joe Biden’s promises to unify the country, the same poll showed that 54% of respondents said they were either “not very” ot “not at all” confident he will be able to do it.<br></p><p>Voters are right to be skeptical. US politicians understand that the current electoral system in the US incentivizes a proverbial call to arms against the other side. It’s a zero-sum battle, after all, where their side has to win and the other side has to lose at any cost.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As a result, “unity” and “compromise” fall by the wayside while the partisan narrative escalates as the stakes raised in each election cycle are without limit.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Each side has to constantly raise (or in this case lower) the bar on the “other side” to inflame the passions and anger of their supporters while convincing voters outside of their base of support that they have to pick a team, red or blue, lest their least desired option wins and the country as they know it is doomed.<br></p><p><strong>Partisanship reigns supreme in US elections.</strong> In fact, the nonpartisan reform group <a href=\"https://fairvote.com/\">FairVote</a> found in its <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/new-report-the-greatest-advantage-in-us-elections-is-partisanship-not-incumbency\">2020 “Monopoly in Politics” report</a> that partisanship has become a greater advantage to winning elections than incumbency -- a reality that has startling consequences.<br></p><p>“An increase in the predictability of partisanship at the expense of incumbency advantage, even for incumbents who maintained moderate voting records, means something troubling: the identity of candidates and their campaigns are mattering less and less,” FairVote’s report states.<br></p><p>Read that again: “The identity of candidates and their campaigns are mattering less and less.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>Consider, for a moment, what that means. It means it doesn’t really matter who the person running for office is as long as they hit the right ideological notes to bring out the right segment of voters in an election, particularly primary elections. This idea may bring to&nbsp; mind some politicians elected in recent years.<br></p><p>Yet, voters are told and expected to pick a side. People are told they cannot vote their conscience, which in some cases may be to vote for a third party or independent candidate, because the consequences of the least desired outcome would be dire. They have to vote <em>against</em> the “other side.”<br></p><p>This is a system that fosters division, which begets anger and hate. It is impossible for anyone to bring about the healing change Americans desire as long as the way we conduct elections goes unchanged. <strong>The only way to mend the divide and give voters a fairer, more accountable, more representative process is to transform how voters elect public officials.</strong></p><h2>Ranked Choice Voting: Simple, Fair, and Easy</h2><p>There is no single solution to the myriad of problems that plague a US political process that prevents electrons from being truly “of, by, and for” the people. There are problems that run deeper than voters realize, which require different types of systemic solutions.<br></p><p>However, several reform advocates and groups are getting behind an alternative voting method that has a documented history of bringing more civility to elections, while fostering an election environment in which voters feel more confident in their vote and the process at-large: ranked choice voting.<br></p><p>The current voting system in much of the country requires voters to choose one, and only one candidate. But remember, choose the wrong candidate and all the things you may fear and dread from the least desired option will come true. Thus, many voters adopt a “lesser of two evils” mindset.<br></p><p>“We have to do this strategic voting,” said FairVote Senior Research Analyst Deb Otis, in a podcast interview. “Do I vote for the candidate that I really like best or do I vote for a candidate who is a frontrunner and has a real chance at winning.”<br></p><blockquote>“Choosing one candidate in a crowded field can be very difficult, and we all have to be very strategic and do the math about how to make our vote the most powerful.”<br></blockquote><p>As we see in elections, this leads to vote splitting, which in a crowded primary field and even in a general election with more than two candidates can result in plurality winners, meaning more voters didn’t vote for the elected candidate.</p><p>It is also not uncommon for independent or third party candidates to take the blame when a major party candidate doesn’t win, because the argument goes that if that candidate wasn’t in the race to begin with, the losing major party candidate would have won.<br></p><p>This speaks to the overwhelming sense of entitlement the major parties have over the election process. There is no way of knowing how a close election decided by only a few percentage points would have turned out if there weren’t more than two candidates in the race.<br></p><p>The “spoiler augment,” however, prevails in convincing voters that they have to sacrifice their right to a meaningful say in the process to ensure the “greater evil” or least desired outcome doesn’t win. The system was designed to enforce the major parties entitlement over elections at the expense of a fair and accurate process.<br></p><p>Does that sound like a truly representative system? Otis explained why “ranking is much more intuitive” and greatly reduces strategic voting and the “lesser of two evils” mindset.<br></p><p>“We all rank things in our everyday life, right?” She said. “We all know what our second choice is if the store is out of our first choice in cereal or whatever. We can do that on the ballot as well.”<br></p><p>And for voters, it’s that simple. They rank candidates in the order they prefer them (first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.). This gives voters greater confidence to select their preferred candidate as their first choice, without being forced to play the partisan game of “pick my side or doom.”</p><div></div><p>Ranked choice voting also means that a candidate needs more than a mere plurality of the vote to win.<br></p><p>“Ranked choice voting promotes majority winners, meaning in order for a candidate to be supported by a majority of their voters,” she said.<br></p><blockquote>“That means at least half of voters, and that should be the lowest bar for our elected officials to serve in office, right?”<br></blockquote><p>Put simply, once polls close, the first preference choices are tabulated. If no candidate gets a majority (50%+1), the last place candidate is eliminated and their voters’ second choices are applied to the tabulation. The process continues (each round eliminating the last place candidate and applying their voters’ next choice to the tabulation) until a candidate has a majority.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ranked choice voting essentially shows how voters would cast their ballot in the event of a runoff without the expense of another election that is all but guaranteed to have lower turnout. <strong>In other words, a majority winner is decided when the most voters participate.</strong>&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>And, voters do not have to think so much about strategy, or as Otis put it, a voter’s best strategy is “to list their honest preferences.”<br></p><p>“Ranked choice voting is good for voters,” she said, “whether you support a major party -- you don't have to worry about spoiler candidates from minor parties siphoning votes away from your candidate.”&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“It’s great for supporters of independents or third party candidates who now voters are free to vote for those candidates without fear they are wasting their vote. It is good for election officials who can take office with the confidence that they have the support of their constituents. This is something we can all come together on, regardless of our party.”<br></blockquote><p>Opponents to ranked choice voting reform often turn to an argument that RCV is too complex for voters to understand, and when they approve it at the ballot box, they didn’t really know what they were doing.<br></p><p>“People who make that argument are hugely underestimating their friends and neighbors,” said Otis.<br></p><blockquote>“The data from places already using ranked choice voting shows that overwhelmingly voters like it, voters report they understood it, and voters are not making ballot errors. Voters know how to do this. So, those arguments really don’t hold up.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>It is worth noting that the “it’s too complex” argument is -- just like the benefits of ranked choice voting -- not limited to a single party. Republican leaders have made this argument in Maine, including in lawsuits challenging the system, as have some Democratic leaders in New York City.</p><h2>Candidates Engage With Their Communities Differently under Ranked Choice Voting</h2><p>Now, in most elections, independent and third party candidates are not likely to win. They don’t have the support infrastructure that major party candidates have and as a result they often lack the means to boost their name recognition and appeal.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Voters have also long been conditioned to think there are only two viable options in elections, which is not easy to overcome. Ranked choice voting doesn’t necessarily change this, nor would any alternative voting method on its own.&nbsp;<br></p><p>However, ranked choice voting eliminates the spoiler excuse used by the major parties and their candidates because it’s on the candidates to build a broad coalition of support to reach a majority. This means voters who prefer a third party or independent candidate become more important to major party candidates.</p><p>“With ranked choice voting, by requiring this majority support, we get candidates engaging differently with voters -- engaging differently with the community,” said Otis. “They know that it is not enough to pander to once niche base. That will not get them the majority they need to win.”<br></p><blockquote>“We see candidates reaching out to a broader [segment] of the electorate in order to build that consensus of support.”<br></blockquote><p>And, as voters outside a candidate’s typical base of support become more important, so do the ideas of the candidates they support. So, while independent and third party candidates may not win, their ideas must be addressed by the major party candidates.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Thus, the marketplace of ideas expands.<br></p><p>It is also easy to see how this fosters a more civil campaign environment. If a candidate has to campaign for a voter’s second choice or their third choice, they are not going to attack that voter’s first choice. They need to build a broad coalition of support in order to win.<br></p><p>It is important to note that the effects ranked choice voting has on campaign civility is not theoretical. It has been studied and is well-documented.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A <a href=\"https://eamonmcginn.com.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/papers/IRV_in_Minneapolis.pdf\">2020 study</a> by Eamon McGinn of the University of Technology Sydney, for example, found evidence that the voting method “improved the civility of debates with candidates substituting negative or neutral words for positive words” in RCV (or instant runoff voting, IRV)&nbsp;mayoral races.<br></p><p>McGinn concludes:<br></p><blockquote>“There is genuine value being created by the recent increase in municipalities using IRV, and also provides evidence of additional benefits for municipalities that are considering changing their electoral system. Perhaps the benefits are enough to alter the cost-benefit calculation for politicians and voters who are weighing up a change to IRV.”<br></blockquote><p>A Eagleton Poll <a href=\"https://fairvote.app.box.com/v/perspectives-on-rcv-bay-area\">surveyed voters in 2013 and 2014</a> on the tone of campaigns. It found that voters in cities that used ranked choice voting were more satisfied with the conduct of campaigns and their candidates, and believed there was less criticism and negative campaigning than in cities that didn’t use ranked choice voting.<br></p><p>One 2013 analysis found that an increase in civility could also be seen in press coverage of campaigns in cities that used ranked choice voting. It showed that articles published in RCV cities were <a href=\"https://fairvote.app.box.com/v/rcv-kropf-content-analysis\">85% more positive than negative</a>, compared to 77% in non-RCV cities.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Check out more polls, academic research, and analysis </strong><a href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/data_on_rcv#research_rcvcampaigncivility\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br></p><p>The documented history of improving voters’ perception of elections under ranked choice voting continues to be a major selling point for campaigns that want to expand the use of the reform to other cities and states across the US, and is most likely a major reason why its popularity is growing nationwide.<br></p><p>However, also critical to the reform’s growth and success is its documented history of giving a voice to the voters and communities that have long felt marginalized and underrepresented by the standard electoral system in the US.<br></p><p>“[Ranked choice voting] can also help communities build power; specifically, underrepresented communities,” said Otis.<br></p><blockquote>“In our current elections we often see candidates of color locked out of winning these elections. Sometimes this can happen because of vote splitting between similar candidates. Ranked choice voting welcomes more of these voices into the conversation, avoids the vote splitting problem, and helps communities consolidate and build power to have their voices heard.”<br></blockquote><p>There is one city, in particular, that sticks out in the conversation of empowering communities of color through ranked choice voting, and it is an often overlooked case for switching to an alternative voting method like RCV. That city is Eastpointe, Michigan.</p><h2>RCV in Eastpointe: A Case Study in Empowering Communities of Color<br></h2><p>Many of the cities that have adopted the use of ranked choice voting did so by ballot initiative or through referendum approved by the city council. Eastpointe, Michigan, is different. The voting method was put in place there explicitly to end racial discrimination in elections.<br></p><p>As racial inequality is also a major topic right now at the national level, it is important to understand how nonpartisan reform like ranked choice voting can lead to a more equitable system across different social, economic, and racial demographics.<br></p><p>“The ranked choice voting implemented in Eastpointe was the proportional representation form of ranked choice voting, and it was the first time it had been used as a remedy to a Voting Rights Act challenge,” said Otis.<br></p><p>In January 2017, Eastpointe was sued by the Department of Justice, which alleged that the city’s elections racially discriminated against minority voters under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The city’s black population has expanded rapidly over the years, <a href=\"https://detourdetroiter.com/eastpointe-ranked-choice-voting-documentary/\">growing from 7% to 40% between 2000 and 2017</a>. Yet, not a single black candidate had won a contested race in the city up to that point.<br></p><p>Documentary filmmaker Grace McNally made this the subject of her short film, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/440150277\"><em>Eastpointe</em></a>, which takes a closer look at how winner-take-all, at-large voting systems can constrain minority representation.<br></p><p>The film early on points out that challenging the voting system was not suggesting members of the Eastpointe City Council or its residents were willfully suppressing the black community. However, many of its residents took the DOJ’s actions as an attack on them, and by focusing inward, failed to see just how inequitable the system was.<br></p><p>“It’s not the product of active racism, but it is still something that needs to be fixed,” said Justin Levitt, former deputy attorney general of the United State. “It doesn’t actually fit the concept of how we think of representation to let a thin majority or a thin plurality of voters win every single seat all the time. That leaves a lot of people out.”<br></p><p>“That’s not fair and it doesn’t have to be anyone’s fault to fix it.”<br></p><p>Traditionally, this type of violation to the Voting Rights Act would be resolved by the creation of a single-member district. The inherent problem with this, and one that members of the black community had, was that this essentially suggested a segregated district for black voters, where if they wanted a meaningful say in city elections, they had to move to a specific district.<br></p><p>It is important to note that for advocates of change in the area, this was not necessarily about ensuring that there was always a black candidate elected to the city council. What mattered was that a sizable community within the voting population could elect the candidate of their choice.<br></p><p><strong>So, for the first time in US history, the DOJ agreed to use ranked choice voting as a remedy to the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>“Districts aren’t the only option. They’re never the only option,” said Levitt. “Eastpointe shows that it is possible to think a little outside the usual box in order to come up with a system that works fairly for everyone.”<br></p><p>“These sort of alternative systems can be very powerful in ways that can allow people to vote throughout the jurisdiction without forcing them to move to a particular part of town that is designated as ‘the place where you get the remedy.’”<br></p><p>What makes the Eastpointe system different from many of the other ranked choice voting systems across the US is it is a proportional system. A candidate needs 33% of the vote for a seat on the city council. If a voters’ first preference doesn’t reach that threshold, their next choice is counted.<br></p><p>“This has now become a viable remedy that other cities can use if they get a Voting Rights challenge or simply if they just notice that they have a majority governing with 100% of the seats even if that majority is only 60% of the people,” said Deb Otis.<br></p><p>Levitt also commented that when a ranked choice voting system is done right, it is a way of sharing power -- “respecting majority rule without shutting out the minority community entirely across the board.”<br></p><p>The turnout for the 2019 municipal elections in Eastpointe, the first to use ranked choice voting, was the highest recorded in 12 years. In the City Council elections, 69% of voters were represented by their first or second choice.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And, one of the winners, incumbent Councilmember Sara Lucido, said she found the electoral process under ranked choice voting to be more positive.&nbsp;</p><h2>RCV: From a Thought Experiment to a Successful Reform Remedy</h2><blockquote>“We’re in the middle of this transformation right now in the US where more people are learning about this election reform, and folks used to look at this as sort of a thought experiment, like ‘hey, wouldn’t this be cool,’ but we are moving beyond that. We’re moving from a thought experiment to common practice.” - Deb Otis, Senior Research Analyst at FairVote<br></blockquote><p>Even an odd-numbered year is not a slow time for ranked choice voting reform. For instance, in 2021, 5 cities will use ranked choice voting for the first time, the biggest (both literally and figuratively) is New York City, which started the process of testing the use of RCV for a February special election in late January.<br></p><p>“Getting ranked choice voting approved in New York City basically doubles the number of Americans who are voting with this method,” said Otis.<br></p><p>The ballot initiative to implement ranked choice voting for city primary elections wasn’t approved by a slim majority either. It was approved by a margin of nearly 3-to-1, and it will be used <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/how-andrew-yang-could-end-the-political-monopoly-in-nyc\">despite a last minute attempt</a> by some members of the Democratic establishment in the city to halt its use by going through the courts.<br></p><p>The lawsuit failed, as has most every other challenge to the alternative voting method to be brought before a judge.<br></p><p>The other four cities to implement ranked choice voting in 2021 are Bloomington and Minnetonka, Minnesota, and Amherst and Easthampton, Massachusetts. And, new campaigns continue to emerge to expand the use of ranked choice voting in other cities and states across the country.<br></p><p>Sara Swann, <a href=\"https://thefulcrum.us/voting/ranked-choice-voting-2650155906\">reporting for the Fulcrum</a>, noted that “more than two dozen states have active campaigns advocating for ranked-choice elections.” More jurisdictions than at any other point in modern history are moving or considering a move toward ranked choice voting.<br></p><p>This is not to say that the reform doesn’t face challenges. Despite a strong grassroots movement to get it passed at the state level in Massachusetts and seemingly insurmountable support from major public figures within the state, for instance, a 2020 ballot initiative fell short of voter approval.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Deb Otis noted that a significant hurdle that advocates of ranked choice voting continue to face is a perception that it is explicitly designed to give an advantage to a single group of people or party.<br></p><p>“As we try to bring ranked choice voting to more cities and states, there are some parts of the country where this is viewed as a politically polarizing reform,” she said. “We are making greater inroads with becoming bipartisan.”<br></p><p>Specifically, she said she is encouraged by the increased interest in traditionally red states and Republican jurisdiction, including cities in Utah, but also the passage of Ballot Measure 2 in Alaska in 2020, which included ranked choice voting for the general election.<br></p><p>It is worth mentioning that two GOP lawmakers in Utah have <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/1/18/22227193/state-legislature-may-consider-ranked-choice-voting-to-give-candidate-clear-majority-of-support\">sponsored a bill</a> to bring ranked choice voting to state and county primary elections after seeing too many candidates win primaries without a majority mandate.<br></p><p>“This is an area where I think folks from all parties can come together,” said Otis. “There are so many things that seem to be tearing us apart politically these days, but ranked choice voting is something that is good for everyone.”<br></p><p>The momentum behind ranked choice voting continues to increase, Just as a handful of cities are implementing its use for the first time in 2021, another handful will use it for the first time in 2022.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Plus, several campaigns are emerging to put ranked choice voting on the 2022 midterm ballot or the 2024 presidential ballot.<br></p><p>Otis said one of the focuses of her organization looking ahead is the presidential primaries. The field of candidates always starts out large for the party not in the White House or in open seat years, so the highest vote-getters in early contests often don’t get near a majority mandate.<br></p><p>Take the 2020 presidential election as an example. Bernie Sanders was the top vote-getter in the Iowa Caucuses with 26.5% of the vote after the final alignment. Sanders also was the top vote-getter in New Hampshire with 26% of the vote. In both cases, this was far from a majority.<br></p><p>And, ranked choice voting’s use in presidential primaries is not just about which candidates can reach a majority mandate. It also means additional opportunities for more candidates to acquire pledged delegates, which means more competitive intra-party elections.<br></p><p>The minimum percentage of the vote required to qualify for delegates in Iowa, for example, is 15%. In a large field where the top-vote getter only gets 26% of the vote, additional runoff rounds means allocation of delegates based on level of support would be more accurate and could include more candidates.<br></p><p>Four Democratic Parties elected to use ranked choice voting in their presidential primaries in 2020. Otis said advocates “clearly need to expand that, and get some Republican Parties using it as well.” She added that FairVote is considering which states might be most open to adopting ranked choice voting in these contests.<br></p><p>Other areas of focus include states that use two-round runoff elections, like voters saw in Georgia for two US Senate races in the 2020 election cycle. Otis explained that these elections end up costing taxpayers millions of dollars, yet many of them are already halfway to ranked choice voting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“They already want to find a majority winner,” she said. “But, they are asking people to the polls twice, which is costing the state a lot of money, it causes a big drop in turnout, and it is inconvenient for voters.”<br></p><p>Clearly, there is no shortage of avenues to expand the reform, from local municipalities to presidential elections. Advocates are optimistic about the future of ranked choice voting, and they have no reason not to be. It has the strongest level of support of any nonpartisan reform being proposed to provide voters with better, more accountable, more competitive, and more civil elections.<br></p>","name":"Joe Biden Can't Bring Voters Together, But There's One Reform That Can","slug":"joe-biden-cant-bring-voters-together-but-theres-one-reform-that-can","author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","topics-new":"5d2cdfbcf786224ea62087b7","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"updated-on":"2021-01-29T14:53:56.797Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2021-01-29T14:07:35.616Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2021-02-03T16:23:33.715Z","published-by":"Person_5aba858c60e60012c4d044f0","hero":{"fileId":"5d4b26b2f620e033780ccfcb","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d4b26b2f620e033780ccfcb_christopher-burns-189796-unsplash.jpg","alt":null},"teaser":"Ranked choice voting, or the ability to rank candidates on the ballot in order of preference instead of simply choosing one, has been adopted and/or implemented in 21 cities and 2 states, representing a total voting age population of over 9.2 million people.","media":{"url":"https://anchor.fm/toppling-the-duopoly/episodes/Ranked-Choice-Voting-Serving-Over-9-Million-Voters-and-Counting-epl4ks","metadata":{"width":400,"height":102,"html":"<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Ftoppling-the-duopoly%2Fembed%2Fepisodes%2FRanked-Choice-Voting-Serving-Over-9-Million-Voters-and-Counting-epl4ks&display_name=Anchor+FM+Inc.&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Ftoppling-the-duopoly%2Fepisodes%2FRanked-Choice-Voting-Serving-Over-9-Million-Voters-and-Counting-epl4ks&image=https%3A%2F%2Fd3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fpodcast_uploaded_nologo400%2F11632615%2F11632615-1610719659553-2fdad917b1306.jpg&key=c4e54deccf4d4ec997a64902e9a30300&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=anchor\" width=\"400\" height=\"102\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Anchor FM Inc. embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>","aspectRatio":0,"title":"Ranked Choice Voting: Serving Over 9 Million Voters and Counting by Toppling the Duopoly","provider_name":"Anchor FM Inc.","type":"rich","thumbnail_url":"https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_nologo400/11632615/11632615-1610719659553-2fdad917b1306.jpg","description":"In this episode of Toppling the Duopoly, election reform expert and host Shawn Griffiths takes a look at the momentum behind ranked choice voting.

He believes what he said then. And, he believes it today. This speech is even more relevant today than it was back then as we see the continued downward spiral of politics and political discourse in the United States:</em></p><p>‍</p><p>Shortly after the November elections, a prominent national magazine ran a feature story declaring that “the moderates' numbers in both parties in Congress have been decimated by retirements and by last Tuesday's elections...and neither party has the leaders or programs to transcend the need to satisfy the fire breathers on the edges. The electorate, meanwhile, veers back and forth, trying to reach an equilibrium.” Equilibrium seems unlikely, however, as long as moderation and compromise are foul concepts to the fire breathers.&nbsp;</p><p>Without the tempering influence of moderation, the public face of politics is dissolved into banal drama. Extremists engage in theatrical behavior by demonizing their foes in bitterly careless terms<strong>. </strong>Unfortunately, calling your adversary “pond scum” is not likely to move the debate toward resolution. The Left rails against the “Christian Fundamentalist Mafia,” while the Right poleaxes the “lesbian spear chuckers and Marxist creeps”..or, “coke-snorting, wife-swapping, baby-born-out-of-wedlock, radical Hollywood left.” In typically decorous terms, one ideologue recently blasted an adversary's proposal by declaring that it must be totally obliterated: “We have to blow up this train and the rails and the trestle and kill everyone on board.\"&nbsp;</p><p>With depressing regularity on both sides of party politics we witness demagogues who villify their opponents and promote a simplistic path to virtue. When political utterance descends to such levels, moderates should issue a call for public responsibility. Calm and balance must be restored in this denunciatory atmosphere before it heralds an era of intellectual intolerance that will shame us all.&nbsp;</p><p>America is being suffocated by those who inhabit the political extremes. Can it be that thinking in extremes is becoming our national disease? There is a growing fear among moderates that polarization is addictive: the crack cocaine of politics.&nbsp;</p><p>We must all be wary of those paladins of virtue who use exaggerated threats to achieve a narrow ideological agenda. The corrosive politics of extremism has weakened and threatens to break the traditional American genius for moderation, for making progress by reaching practical compromises to meet real social and economic needs.&nbsp;</p><p>As so many political moderates are being swept away by today's turbulent currents, perhaps it would be instructuve to reflect on the role of moderation in our tradition of government.&nbsp;</p><h2>AN AMERICAN TRADITION&nbsp;</h2><p>Ever since the framing of the Constitution, this country has been held together by the impulse to moderation. Moderation was the very soul of our Constitution. Our government was structured from the beginning so that each branch could moderate the other. It was the genius of our constitutional architects to separate powers between the national and state governments, and establish a tri-partite division of responsibility between the judicial, executive, and legislative branches. They split legislative authority between the president and the Congress, but divided it further between the House and the Senate.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire system reflects a deep-seated fear of an all-powerful central government. It is so concerned with safeguards against political absolutism, so intent on its complex system of checks and balances, that any tendency toward extremism is most likely to produce an impasse in the operations of government. In this framework for governing, moderation and compromise are the only instruments for overcoming deadlock.&nbsp;</p><p>At the constitutional convention of 1787 in Philadelphia, men struggled to fashion a pragmatic compromise that would both create a strong national government and be acceptable to the people of the states. The Philadelphia convention was attacked from both the Right and the Left. However, agreement on the Philadelphia constitution was eased by the anticipation that one widely respected man of moderation would become chief executive of the new government.&nbsp;</p><p>During the debates in 1787-88 over the yet-unratified Constitution, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay (Publius) introduced the Federalist as a “lesson of moderation.” Their principal concern was that “A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose.” Thus, they requested that a recognition of honest differences among well-meaning people “furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so thoroughly persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy.” Their ultimate concern was that “Without this armor [of moderation], a nation becomes vulnerable to poisons such as those attending the zealous and factious politics” of the sort they observed everywhere in the state governments under the Articles of Confederation.&nbsp;</p><p>The Philadelphia constitution was a masterpiece of moderation. It was a product of political practitioners well-versed in principles and working to reconcile conflicting motives. The men of vision who gathered there in the summer of 1787 stressed the critical importance of moderation in the “science of politics' while they were engaged in creating the new nation. A few delegates did not sign the final document, but more than eighty percent of them did.&nbsp;</p><p>George Washington, while urging good temper and mutual forbearance, accepted the reality of the clash of interests between different regions and factions in the country. But he proclaimed to the new nation that “the spirit of accommodation forms the basis of the Constitution.”&nbsp;</p><p>Beginning with the Revolutionary War, successful political movements have followed a pragmatic and moderate course--rejecting absolutes in favor of concrete solutions that work in particular situations. American solutions have traditionally favored the realistic and practical over the Utopian and theoretical. Our history is one of striving for the middle way. Structurally, the balance alternates somewhere between a strong federal government and a loose collection of autonomous states. Economically, it is somewhere between central control and laissez-faire mercantilism. Answers to this country's problems have never been found in the doctrinaire purism of the extremes.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason for this moderation is our tradition of individualism, which has fostered a healthy distrust of government and a strong tendency to believe, with Jefferson, that the government which governs least governs best. We have also embraced the Emersonian creed of self-reliance, the concept that every man is responsible for shaping his own destiny. This faith has maintained a lasting grip on the American imagination. Given the incredible dynamism of the American economy, the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian ideal of the self-made man able to rise according to his ability is more than a cultural illusion. And as long as economic opportunity is more fact than fiction, why follow Marx rather than Franklin? Moderation predominates.&nbsp;</p><p>Our constitution was designed by men fired with a passionate desire to control their own destinies, but that process was nourished and guided by the spirit of moderation. Our ancestors confronted overwhelming challenges, but they managed to shed the manacles of monarchy while avoiding the worst excesses of the French revolution only a few years later.&nbsp;</p><p>Jefferson believed that all laws should be revised every twenty years or so “to take into account the continuity of progress.” He felt this was necessary in light of naturally occurring changes in social and economic conditions. What Jefferson advocated was not dramatic upheaval in a moment of turmoil and excitement but “moderate and reasoned revision,” effected periodically in order that government might keep pace with social change. Today, a thorough rethinking of national policies may well be overdue, but it violates good judgement to brandish a sledgehammer at tasks that require intelligence and deliberation. The time may be right for new direction, but not through excess and recklessness.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing was more characteristic of Jefferson's thinking on moderation than his recognition that changes in institutions are necessary for social progress. He believed that, once self-government had been attained, economic and social ills would be progressively corrected by the orderly and moderate processes of legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>Moderation implies recognition of the legitimate interests of others in a constantly shifting society. This has always been a diverse country and its cohesion, whatever cohesion exists, can only be based on mutual respect.&nbsp;</p><p>The pluralism of this country produced a system in which any group intent on using political means for economic or ideological ends is practically compelled to join with other groups (economic and non-economic) and submit to the give-and-take of political compromise in order to hope for success. As a result, each group must moderate its self-serving objectives and turn to accommodation.&nbsp;</p><p>We always have been a pluralistic country. Many ethical and intellectual positions could coexist within the framework of the republic&nbsp;</p><p>The major political parties which emerged in this country are not constructed on monolithic ideological foundations. Instead, they evolved as a conglomeration of diverse interests--brokers of conflicting pressures--mediators between divergent economic, social, religious, and philosophical tendencies. Their basic methods were pragmatic and their guiding spirit was moderation.&nbsp;</p><p>When his Democracy in America was published in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville described a “universal moderation” in this country that “tempers the rigor of despotism,” restrains the excessive passions of men, checks within certain limits the inordinate stretch of a leader's desires and “moderates the sovereign himself.”&nbsp;</p><p>Tocqueville also observed that this universal moderation encouraged \"a reciprocal disposition to treat one another humanely.” In his opinion, the customs of society become more humane and gentle in proportion as men become more equal.” Thus, it produced a general tendency “to help prevent the prostration of man.\"&nbsp;</p><p>We should also remember Judge Learned Hand's thoughts in 1942: “This much I do know--that a society so riven that the spirit of moderation is gone, no court can save; that a society where that spirit flourishes, no court need save; that in a society which evades its responsibility by thrusting upon the courts the nurture of that spirit, that spirit in the end will perish.”&nbsp;</p><h2>THE GOLDEN MEAN&nbsp;</h2><p>The study of politics has been an ancient and venerable enterprise of human understanding. Origins and philosophical underpinnings of moderation doctrines have been traced to the tenets of the Enlightenment, early Christianity, classical Greek thought, Buddhism, even Confucius.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, talk of moderation surfaces only in the context of wondering where it has recently gone. But the Greeks long held a belief that linked moderation with wisdom in human activities.&nbsp;</p><p>In Aristotle's classic definition, the virtue of moderation represents the Golden Mean between contrary extremes. He believed that goodness lay in the adequate performance of whatever function a thing or being was best suited for. In the case of men, this meant the use of reason and the exercise of moderation. Aristotle, however, also recognized that while too much boldness can be excessive, too much caution can be dilatory.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Nicomachean Ethics (fourth century B.C.), Aristotle proclaimed that “virtue is a mean that lies between two vices, one of excess and the other of deficiency... Therefore he who aims at the mean should make it his first care to keep away from the extreme which is more contrary than the other to the mean..For one of the two extremes is always more erroneous than the other. And since hitting the mean exactly is difficult, one must take the next best course, and choose the least of the evils as the safest plan... This much, then, is plain: in all our conduct, the mean is the most praiseworthy state. But as a practical matter, we must sometimes aim a bit toward excess and sometimes toward deficiency, because this will be the easiest way of hitting the mean, that is, what is right.”&nbsp;</p><p>In his shrewd Essays (1597) the English philosopher/statesman Francis Bacon urged the wisdom of \"holding a middle course” by recalling the famous Greek myth of Icarus: “Icarus, being to fly across the sea, was ordered by his father (Daedalus) neither to soar too high nor fly too low, for, as his wings were fastened together with wax, there was danger of its melting by the sun's heat in too high a flight, and of its becoming less tenacious by the moisture if he kept too near the vapor of the sea. But he...soared aloft, and fell down headlong.” Bacon explained that “the fable is easily interpreted; for the path of virtue lies straight between excess on the one side, and defect on the other...and no wonder that excess should prove the bane of Icarus.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bacon also advocated moderation in “matters of the understanding,” by using a favorite metaphor. He observed that great navigating skill is required to negotiate the difficulty and danger between Scylla and Charybdis (off the coast of Sicily, in the Strait of Messina): “If the ship strikes upon Scylla, it is dashed in pieces against the rocks; if upon Charybdis, it is swallowed outright (by the immense whirlpool).” As he explained, \"This allegory is pregnant with matter but we shall only observe the force of it lies h that a mean lies here, that a mean be observed in every doctrine and science, and in the rules and axioms thereof, between the rocks of distinctions and the whirlpools of generalities; for these two are the bane and shipwreck of fine geniuses and arts.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bacon also advocated moderation in \"matters of the understanding,\" by using a favorite metaphor.

It attempted to present man with a system that leads to rescue from his situation (Nagarjuna, Treatise of the Middle Way, second century A.D.).<br></p><p>To rule by superior virtue and moderation rather than by force also became a very influential element in Confucian political thinking (~500 B.C.). The ethical system emphasized filial piety, faithfulness, intelligence, virtue, moderation and the maintenance of peace in Chinese religion and statecraft.<br></p><p>In his classic guide to strategy, A Book of Five Rings (1645), Miyamoto Musashi, the invincible Japanese warrior-philosopher, offered some thoughts on \"spiritual bearing:\" \"Meet the situation without tenseness yet not recklessly, your spirit settled yet unbiased...Be neither insufficiently spirited nor over spirited.\" In his view, intuitive moderation in all pursuits throughout life was an essential element in the Way of Strategy.<br></p><p>Philosophers of the Enlightenment in the second half of the eighteenth century recognized the profound limits of human understanding. They worked against what Adam Smith called \"excessively immoderate expressions\" and attempted to prescribe general guides to understanding so that \" it might perform at its humble best.\" And they shared a commitment to shaping what they called a politics of moderation, to promote public spirit and combat the excesses of ideology.<br></p><p>A new \"politics of moderation\" coupled with a critique of rigid ideology was central to the Enlightenment. A key aspect of the political intent behind John Locke's thought was reflected in his criticism of those we now call ideologues. Locke warned against the \"extravagance of ideology,\" because it undermined the role of rational argument and moderation. He also dismissed \"the untractable Zealots in different and opposite Parties.\"<br></p><p>In Wealth of Nations (1776), Adam Smith suggested that, protected from the \"poisons of ideology and superstition,\" both the individual mind and the body politic may attempt to govern as an \"impartial spectator\" might, which requires \"good temper and moderation.\" This early politics of moderation emphasized the attendant virtues of impartiality, candor, and coolness of temper.<br></p><p>In the 1780s when Hume opened his famous essay, \"That Politics May be Reduced to a Science,\" he presented himself as \"a friend of Moderation.\" His moderation was characterized by a calm and objective mode of political argument more than it picked out a particular agenda. This new \"science of politics\" based on moderation was essentially constructive and forward-looking in its perspective on governing.<br></p><p>In Christianity, the most fundamental guide to moderation lies within the greatest commandment: Love thy neighbor as thyself. It is further expressed in what we all know as The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</p><p>But Ecclesiasticus said it most clearly:</p><blockquote>\"Listen to me, my son, do not disregard me, eventually, you will see the force of my words: Be moderate in all your activities.\" (Chapter 31, verse 22)</blockquote><p>W.B. Yeats dramatized the opposite of moderation in his poem \"The Second Coming\": </p><blockquote>\"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<strong> The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity...\"</strong></blockquote><h2>THE QUALITY OF MODERATION<br></h2><p>Nearly all the public opinion polls suggest a deep discontent with polarization combined with the widespread desire to find a middle ground.<br></p><p>Zealots take extreme positions and tend to view compromise the way Dracula reacts to the cross. Where extreme clashes with extreme, there is often a conviction of the impossibility of a middle position. Moderates work to balance the destructive tendencies of colliding factions. They cool the frenzy of hostile adversaries.<br></p><p>The extremes on the right and left hold narrow visions accompanied by convictions of their infallibility. They agree on a notion of \"freedom\" meaning the ability to act as one chooses without interference from government. But they differ about where they think such freedom is legitimate. Generally speaking, the left insists on the value of absolute freedom in personal matters but is perfectly willing to accept coercion in economics and politics. Meanwhile, the right demands coercion in private life but insists on the fullest economic and political freedom.<br></p><p><strong>Moderation is constantly challenged to keep antagonistic perspectives in balance. The moderate is ever trying to bring a temporary harmony to contrasting points of view.</strong><br></p><p>Politics tends to be an extremely complex and ambiguous activity. There are no easy solutions to serious political problems. Consequently, ideological and doctrinaire answers usually fail to meet the real needs.<br></p><p>The concept of trying to find the moderate balance between exaggerated extremes dominated Harold Macmillan's classic work, entitled appropriately The Middle Way. The future Conservative Prime Minister attacked the 'rigid die-hards' equally on both sides.</p><p><strong>He believed the middle way makes it possible to combine dedication to principles while recognizing the shortcomings of human nature.</strong></p><p>\"If Democracy ceases to serve the cause of progress; if it is unable to make full use of the productucve possibilities of the economic system for the enrichment of life; it will be divided by internal conflicts and become the prey of unscrupulous men who know not the neaning of tolerance or the virtue of moderation.\" (Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, The Middle Way, 1942)<strong><br></strong></p><p>Montaigne wrote that, \"Our opinions are grafted one on another. The first serves as a stock for the second, the second for the third. We thus climb the ladder, step by step... In a running stream, we see one ripple endlessly pursuing another, in never-ending sequence...Water ever flows into water, and it is always the same stream, but always different water.\"<strong><br></strong></p><p>We expand our knowledge by combining the successes of the past with innovations of the present. Continuously discarding or modifying failed efforts, moderates blend together the best and the most durable. Moderates are never completely satisfied with the status quo, always experimental , optimistic and creative.<strong><br></strong></p><p>The dynamic of social change resides in our discontent with things as they are. If that discontent is shared collectively, then these changes can be accomplished by a process of moderation and peaceful evolution.<strong><br></strong></p><p>Moderation is an exercise in creative freedom. The moderate policy-maker is an experimenter. But moderates appreciate the limits as well as the potentialities of political engineering. Some problems may be solved only by ' time' s arrow.'<strong><br></strong></p><p>Moderates believe that the creative act of governance inspires creativity in others. They would rather appeal to people's hopes than their fears.<strong><br></strong></p><p>The moderate is fundamentally an optimist. Moderates recognize human fallibility, but refuse to be overwhelmed by it. They are not easily distracted by disappointment. Optimism enables the moderate to be patient when progress is slow. The moderate has a fundamental faith and trust in the future.<strong><br></strong></p><p>Moderates are realistic about human nature. Moderates realize it is not possible to create a Mozart symphony from every set of discordant themes. Their goal is to minimize official arbitrariness and maintain reasonably stable conditions for social and political life. The moderate is a seeker of balance--a proponent of fairness even while recognizing its elusive nature.<strong><br></strong></p><p>The moderate is tolerant of ambiguity. But exercising reasoned judgement does not mean surrendering to fatuous complacency.<strong><br></strong></p><p>Moderates recognize that in governing we must exercise courage as well as caution. We enjoy the sublime and the ridiculous, Greek and Shakespearian tragedy. The richness of life consists in a range of qualities. Life would surely be dull if we were equally moderate about everything.<br></p><p>Moderates can appreciate discords, tensions, conflicts in the drama of governing. The great musicians use discords as well as harmonies. Superficial discord can even be comic. But in politics, unlike music, there can be an unfortunate price for the excesses-­ bad laws, for example.<strong><br></strong></p><p>Moderates are inspired to create opportunities for individuals to reach that distant plateau of personal worth and dignity. This is what elevates these efforts above the others.<strong><br></strong></p><p>The moderate believes that to the extent government must intrude in people's lives, there is a responsibility to determine the most judicious modes of interference. The less intrusive the better.<strong><br></strong></p><p>The perpetual struggle between people' s desire for personal freedom and their need to accept social restraints continues in the modern age. The adherent of the middle way must stress that society, on the one hand, has a responsibility to provide for the material welfare of its members, while the indiv idual, on the other hand, must undertake certain duties and responsibilities to society. This view of moderation is violated by those who are fixed on abstract and inflexible principles that work only in a hypothetical dreamland.<strong><br></strong></p><p>One of the most fundamental lessons from the study of politics is that there are no shortcuts to political salvation. If democratic institutions are to continue flourishing, it will be done through incremental political reform undertaken by moderate, realistic men and women imbued with mutual respect. That is our sobering yet hopeful message.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ours is a legacy of moderation, of reason and progress over ideology and extremism.</strong></p><p>VARIATIONS ON THE THEME<br></p><ul><li>Everything that exceeds the bounds of moderation, has an unstable foundation. - Seneca<br></li></ul><ul><li>Moderation is the center wherein all philosophies, both human and divine, meet -­ Joseph Colton<br></li></ul><ul><li>Moderation is the inseparable companion of wisdom.- Colton<br></li></ul><ul><li>Moderation consists in an indifference about little things and a prudent and well­ proportioned zeal about things of importance.

Political scientist Jasmin Mujanovic was quoted as recommending investing in a massive public education campaign and setting up a 9/11-style commission. Will the current political system also be evaluated? Using the same old party glue will not glue us back together. Why? The American voter is moving on.</p><p>At one time being a Republican or a Democrat was truly synonymous with being American. The election results vividly show that in the presidential elections of 1940 and 1944 Americans voted overwhelmingly as either Republicans or Democrats. Third parties were way under 1 percent of all voters. In the 1940 election the only independent running (Alfred Knutson) got <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Guide_to_U_S_Elections/JDjrCQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=alfred+knutson+1940+election&pg=PA362&printsec=frontcover\" target=\"_blank\">545 votes</a>! Fast forward to today. The demographic changes are massive. About <a href=\"https://users/scollins/Downloads/ROI_Report_R1-1.pdf#page=6\" target=\"_blank\">40 percent</a> of voters are independent voters, a noticeably greater plurality than is enrolled in either major party. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/07/04/535402488/in-america-every-day-is-independents-day#res535403553:~:text=The%20uptick%20in%20%22independent%22%20identification%20has,sharper%20climb%20that%20other%20generations%20had.\" target=\"_blank\">About half</a> of all millennial voters are independent.</p><p>In November Alaska <a href=\"https://www.ktoo.org/2020/11/17/alaska-will-have-a-new-election-system-voters-pass-ballot-measure-2/\" target=\"_blank\">ended</a> its closed primary, the first state in the Union to vote for a top four open primary system. Florida voters came very close to ending their closed primary, which began in 1913. A large majority of Florida voters (<a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/florida-amendment-3-election-results-all-voters-vote-referendum/6041997002/\" target=\"_blank\">57 percent</a>), both party members and independents alike, voted for a top two open primary.

The Independent Voting Project is in the middle of a lawsuit against the state of California, challenging the constitutionality of its denying nearly 6 million independent voters full participation in the taxpayer-funded presidential primary. If IVP wins, it will set a serious precedent in support of the fundamental right to participate in primary elections in any state. This political earthquake will shake Maine and America.</p><p>Last week, Kesich <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2021/01/17/the-view-from-here-fringe-theories-are-mainstream-in-the-gop/?rel=related\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned</a> that some Maine Republican Party leaders have been publicly saying that the presidential election was stolen. They have been, and this is sad! But do Maine and American voters have a stronger theft case? For years both parties have done their best (or worse) controlling our public American election system. They have engaged in lawsuits, gerrymandering of congressional districts, voter suppression, restricting who can and can’t run, etc. Isn’t this “stealing”?</p><p>One vivid example of party control occurred in 1988. In 1976, 1980 and 1984, the national League of Women Voters sponsored the presidential debates in a nonpartisan manner. However, in 1988, the candidates’ campaigns told the League it had to follow the written rules they’d drawn up, which were more partisan. In a shining moment in League history, President Nancy Neuman announced they’d be withdrawing. <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/commentary/presidential-debates-league-of-women-voters-donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-debate-1.49997166\" target=\"_blank\">She said</a> the League did not wish to be “an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public”! Today these debates sadly continue without the League’s sponsorship. Too many in the media aid and abet by painting the states either red, blue or purple while the demographics show a truer picture.</p><p>In 2014, Sen. Chuck Schumer, now majority leader, wrote a New York Times op-ed headlined “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/opinion/charles-schumer-adopt-the-open-primary.html\" target=\"_blank\">End partisan primaries, save America</a>.” Great idea. What are he and both major parties waiting for? The independent voter may well reach a majority of the electorate in the future. Will the two-party system be pushed one day from the mainstream to the fringe? Former Republican U.S. Rep. Mickey Edwards, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/books/titles/160540320/the-parties-versus-the-people-how-to-turn-republicans-and-democrats-into-america#excerpt\" target=\"_blank\">author of</a> “The Parties Versus the People: How to Turn Republicans and Democrats Into Americans,” advised ending the parties’ control over our election system. Good advice, if the parties want to gain the respect of the voter and help reduce membership decline.</p><p>We applaud Bangor state Sen. Joe Baldacci’s sponsorship of a top-two primary bill. May all Mainers urge their state legislators to support this bill so all voters can vote in a public nonpartisan primary that is based on true voter freedom and greater candidate choice. Maine and America are not just red or blue – we are Red, White and Blue!

And, why should voters have to register with a party in order to have a meaningful say in their government?<br></p><p>Let’s take a deeper dive into this issue.</p><h2>Kansas: An Independent-Minded State Governed By a Partisan System<br></h2><p>Kansas is in some ways a paradox. It is a landlocked state, yet when you talk to people who live there or are from there, it sounds like it is almost like an island in itself.<br></p><p>“Kansas is very much its own place,” said state resident and political reform advocate Elaine Stephen. “I’m an Air Force brat. I’ve lived all over the world, and Kansas is unlike any other place I have ever lived -- and I lived in Texas for a long time.”<br></p><p>There is a pride of place, she added, that is quiet but runs deep. There is a spirit of resilience and a common independent mindset that Kansans will do things on their own volition. They are not influenced by outside forces, nor do they desire to be.<br></p><p>“If you think about living on the prairie and what it takes to live out here -- we have parts of the state that are 4 or 5 hours away from a big town -- so it takes a certain kind of resilience and hardiness and independence that means that ‘by golly, we are going to do it ourselves,’” she added.<br></p><p>It might be hard for those peering into the looking glass at Kansas to see or understand the independent-mindedness of Kansans. Kansas is commonly viewed as a deep red state, so the perception by many is that a partisan mindset prevails within its communities.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Yet, how many know that nearly 30% of the Kansas electorate is registered not with the Republican or Democratic Parties, but unaffiliated? How many know that the state has a Republican-controlled legislature, but a Democratic governor?<br></p><p>Kansans pride themselves on their independent spirit. This, however, does not mean the state is immune to hyper-polarized politics. Policies that come out of the legislature are often viewed as deeply-divisive and in the same light as other hardline partisan agendas seen throughout the country and at the national level.<br></p><p>The reason for this, however, has nothing to do with its people. It has to do with the partisan structure of state elections, which is not dissimilar from the systems in place in other states across the country. Elections in Kansas incentivize partisan machinations because they give an exclusive advantage to the parties and their members.<br></p><p>And, this is where our story comes in.</p><h2>A Controversial Amendment Could Be Approved by An Extreme Minority of Voters<br></h2><p>Some Kansas legislators are proposing a constitutional amendment that, if approved by the legislature, would have to go before voters. The thing is, state law does not require the amendment to be placed on the general election ballot, and advocates are pushing for it to be placed on the primary ballot instead.<br></p><p>The amendment, which seeks to reverse a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court ruling that access to abortion was a protected right under the state constitution, <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article239732848.html\">was approved by the Kansas Senate</a> Wednesday evening.<br></p><p>This is the second time advocates for this amendment have attempted to get it through the legislature. It <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/a437c260e6c2148f30e65cef0b6fbcf7\">failed to pass the House</a> in February 2020. However, due to the change in the legislature’s makeup there is a greater chance it will pass both chambers this time around, and lawmakers are rushing to get it through as a result of the state’s response to COVID-19.<br></p><p>“They are trying to do as much as they can with the Kansas Legislature as quickly as possible because they are concerned about an outbreak, and the legislature having to take a break,” said Elaine Stephen, who is one of 3 co-leaders of a new pro-voter reform group,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KansansDemandBetter\"> Kansans Demand Better</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Ms. Stephen and I discussed the proposed amendment and what it would mean for state voters on my podcast, </strong><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/toppling-the-duopoly\"><strong><em>Toppling the Duopoly</em></strong></a><strong>. Listen to the full episode above.</strong><br></p><p>She explained that the makeup of the Kansas Legislature could be divided into three groups: The far-right conservatives, the moderate Republicans, and then the Democrats. As a result of the 2020 election, she said, the conservatives gained more seats in the legislature, as well as an advantage over the moderates, which gave Republicans a supermajority in the legislature.<br></p><p>“The conservative who won seats feel empowered to keep the seats that they gained, and that means going into the 2022 elections -- that’s what they are focused on,” she said.<br></p><blockquote>“What we are frustrated about is they are using an issue that is so important that it requires an amendment to the state constitution as a way to further a political objective.”<br></blockquote><p>Kansas conducts closed partisan primaries on even-year elections -- for the midterms and the presidential elections. This means only registered members of a political party can participate. Everyone else is told to join a party or don’t vote.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So, in an effort to turn out members of the party that are further to the right, advocates of the proposed anti-abortion amendment are pushing to have it placed on the 2022 primary ballot.<br></p><p>It is important to note that primary elections generally have substantially lower turnout than general elections. A good rule of thumb is to take the typical general election turnout and cut it in half, and oftentimes turnout in the primaries is even less than that. Thus, due to the partisan nature of these elections, voters who participate are members of an extreme ideological minority.<br></p><p>To make matters worse, unaffiliated voters (29% of Kansas voters) are denied access to these taxpayer-funded and publicly administered elections. It is only when an item like the proposed constitutional amendment is on the ballot in even-year primary elections that they are allowed to request a special ballot to participate.&nbsp;But even then, many unaffiliated voters are not made aware of their options.<br></p><p>“Our frustration as a group, as mostly unaffiliated voters or voters who only affiliate with a party because we have to in order to fully participate in Kansas elections, we feel like we should not have to join a private political organization to have a full say,” she said.<br></p><p>She further explained that Kansans Demand Better is not taking a position on the amendment. For the group, it doesn’t matter what the proposed constitutional amendment says or would do as much as the fact that it is a change to state law, and thus to ensure every voter's right to an equal say on the matter is protected, it should be put on the general election ballot when the most voters participate.<br></p><p>“Most unaffiliated voters in the state of Kansas are not even aware that they have the right to vote in the nonpartisan municipal primaries that are held in the odd-numbered years, “ Ms. Stephen said. “To expect unaffiliated voters to be aware that they are allowed to vote on <strong><em>one issue </em></strong>alone in the partisan primaries in an even numbered year is unrealistic.”<br></p><blockquote>“Who is going to educate the unaffiliated voters in the state that this is even an option? Since we don’t know, we need to make sure that the unaffiliated voters if they choose to do this are aware that this is an option, but no plan has been proposed by Kansas legislators to educate unaffiliated voters.”<br></blockquote><p>She added that though she cannot say with 100% certainty, it would appear that this is intentional; especially, if the goal is to ensure that only the most ideological extreme voters turnout for the primary.<br></p><p>Even if unaffiliated voters are aware of their options, what is the incentive to come out and vote on a ballot with a single line-item when registered party members get a full slate?&nbsp;<br></p><p>It is also important to note that this does not speak to the intelligence of voters. Kansas voters are accustomed and conditioned to look at elections a certain way, so it doesn’t even occur to them that there is something fundamentally wrong with how the system works and how it can be gamed to deny them a meaningful say.<br></p><p>Voters are often unaware of how critical primary elections are because they are conditioned to believe they are not that important. They are viewed simply as the means by which the parties choose their nominees for the general election. How can anyone expect them to consider how partisan elections incentivize public officials to conduct policy in a way that will appease the most hardcore ideologues of their party’s base?<br></p><p>This is where groups like Kansans Demand Better enter the picture. By focusing efforts to educate voters on the true consequences of a partisan-controlled system, the number of voters who realize the damaging impact the current system has on not just accountable representation, but a fair and equal say in the process increases.<br></p><p>Ms. Stephen said that the pandemic and chaos in 2020 made launching Kansans Demand Better difficult. However, raising awareness on the issue that surrounds the proposed amendment being considered by state lawmakers has led to an increase in support.<br></p><p>Kansas does not allow voter-driven ballot initiatives, so a path to nonpartisan reform is likely going to be more difficult in the state. There has to be an appetite in the legislature for any reform proposal, including changing state law to allow ballot initiatives and voter-driven amendments.<br></p><p>However, even if there are no changes to how elections are conducted, Kansans Demand Better is asking state lawmakers to put items that would drastically change state law on the general election ballot when most voters participate. After all, doesn’t that make the most sense?<br></p>","name":"The Perils of Extreme Minority Rule on Display in Kansas Amendment Fight","slug":"perils-of-extreme-minority-rule-on-display-in-kansas-amendment-fight","topics-new":"5d2cdfbcf786224ea62087b7","author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"network":"5c9124b81ad86f18ebb52217","updated-on":"2021-02-01T15:33:51.697Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2021-01-21T21:45:01.453Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2021-02-01T15:33:51.697Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","hero":{"fileId":"600ad6e30ea96b92e48cbd81","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/600ad6e30ea96b92e48cbd81_kansas%20leg.jpg","alt":null},"media":{"url":"https://anchor.fm/toppling-the-duopoly/episodes/The-Perils-of-Extreme-Minority-Rule-in-Kansas-Amendment-Fight-epaiv4","metadata":{"width":400,"height":102,"html":"<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Ftoppling-the-duopoly%2Fembed%2Fepisodes%2FThe-Perils-of-Extreme-Minority-Rule-in-Kansas-Amendment-Fight-epaiv4&display_name=Anchor+FM+Inc.&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Ftoppling-the-duopoly%2Fepisodes%2FThe-Perils-of-Extreme-Minority-Rule-in-Kansas-Amendment-Fight-epaiv4&image=https%3A%2F%2Fd3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fpodcast_uploaded_nologo400%2F11632615%2F11632615-1610719659553-2fdad917b1306.jpg&key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=anchor\" width=\"400\" height=\"102\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Anchor FM Inc. embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>","aspectRatio":0,"title":"The Perils of Extreme Minority Rule in Kansas Amendment Fight by Toppling the Duopoly","provider_name":"Anchor FM Inc.","type":"rich","thumbnail_url":"https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_nologo400/11632615/11632615-1610719659553-2fdad917b1306.jpg","description":"On this episode of Toppling the Duopoly, the focus turns to Kansas where a group of lawmakers are attempting to push a constitutional amendment that by law has to go before voters for approval.

It may be the death of an idea from which a new innovation emerges. It may be the death of winter, as the earth sits fallow, waiting for spring. It may be the death of a family matriarch and the beginning of our role as the elder. Or it may be the death of flawed national values, from which a new nation arises, like a phoenix.<br></p><p>It’s this last death and rebirth of a nation and society that has captured my attention for more than ten years. What will be our nation’s new beginning? What will We the People collectively decide is valuable? <br></p><p>About 240 years ago, in response to a tyrannical king, Americans prioritized their “pursuit of happiness” as a guiding principle to decision making. In 18th century usage, happiness meant <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/happiness\" target=\"_blank\">prosperity or good fortune</a>. Upon learning this, it changed my understanding of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” All of a sudden, these men of the American Enlightenment seem a little more...materialistic. While today we espouse this pursuit of happiness as our birthright, at the time, they sought to protect their “good fortune” from the King of England and immortalize their “property” rights in our Constitution. <br></p><p>Again and again, throughout our history, Americans have tangled, argued and fought about the value of human beings. The latest example is the response disparity to threats of civil discord, so clearly on display at The Capitol last week. Here are three additional historical examples.<br></p><ol><li>In 1787, the negotiation of the Constitution was won by slave-owners who demanded power and gained the ⅗ compromise -- for Congressional representation -- and the protection of property rights, including <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/black-history-milestones\" target=\"_blank\">the right to repossess any “person held to service or labor” (an obvious euphemism for slavery)</a>. Many of our heralded founders did not hold their slave laborers as equally human, but counted them to retain or suppress political power. <em>Hence, structural racism is written into the Constitution.</em><br></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li>The post Civil War era brought us three “corrective” amendments to the Constitution. The 13th, ending slavery. The 14th, guaranteeing citizenship rights for anyone born in the United States. And the 15th, granting African American men the right to vote. And the era of Reconstruction saw many advancements in equal rights for Black Americans. &nbsp;When the election of 1876 relied upon electors in three states, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/reconstruction-1876-election-rutherford-hayes\" target=\"_blank\">the compromise of 1877</a> awarded the presidency to Rutherford B. Hayes (who lost the popular vote), with the promise of ending Reconstruction and sacrificing the hard-won protections of our Black brothers and sisters. In the following years, states' rights cases won at the Supreme Court were the basis for “Jim Crow” laws that insured segregation throughout the south and gave permission for preserving prejudice in the rest of the country. <em>Structural racism evolved to devalue Black Americans through the courts, legislation and lack of enforcement.</em><br></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li>Abolitionists and suffragists were closely entwined before the Civil War. As the 19th Amendment (granting women the vote) was nearing passage, <a href=\"https://time.com/5876456/black-women-right-to-vote/\" target=\"_blank\">Black women were set at a distance quite intentionally, to hold onto the support of many white southern women.</a> Following passage of the 19th amendment, the groups broke up all coalitions. &nbsp;This collapse of support hampered Black women especially in the south, from actually voting. It would be another 50 years to overcome poll taxes and literacy tests for most Black women in the south with the passage of the Civil Rights Act. <em>Under the banner of pragmatism, racism broke apart a long-held coalition towards equity and equality. </em><br></li></ol><p>On the floor of the Senate, following the violent intimidation, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) cited the compromise of 1877 as an example to challenge the election outcome -- a way to “settle” the election claims through additional investigations. Many of our non-white citizens heard this echo of Jim Crow and offer to “compromise” the promise of equity and equal human value that is within our reach.<br></p><p>Our U.S. history tells us that when we have faced the choice between economic and human interests, our elected leaders choose economic interests every time. Let us make a new choice today. Our national economy is a collective agreement about exchanges of goods, services, properties and pursuit of wealth. Business has shown in the last few days their interests are aligned with equity where in previous times, business was better served by compromise to allow the continuation of structural racism. This is still an economically based decision. Let us adjust our national economic priorities to serve our collective human needs first. And our bank accounts second.<br></p><p>We are in the winter of our constitutional republic. We will experience more dying of people, businesses, institutions and beliefs for a little while longer before spring arrives. But what will bud and blossom in the season of new beginnings? &nbsp;Have we readied the soil (our beliefs and our institutions) to receive a new planting? <br></p><p>Let us till the soil to root out toxic beliefs, toxic practices and make it ready. Let us plant seeds of equity, respect and dignity. Let us recognize that each and every one of us has inherent human value.

It is a phrase voters have heard a lot since November 3, as Donald Trump and many of his supporters claim widespread fraud took place that denied him re-election. </p><p>Lawmakers and advocates who stood by the president and vowed to challenge the election results said they were doing it for the sake of the integrity of the electoral process.</p><p>Challenging the legitimacy of elections is becoming more of a norm than many people might realize. John Pudner, executive director of the nonpartisan reform group <a href=\"https://takeback.org/\">Take Back Our Republic</a>, noted in an <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/op-ed-5-easy-steps-make-sure-2020s-election-disaster-never-repeats/?johnp@takeback.org\">op-ed in the Western Journal</a> that just as many Trump supporters challenged the results and the Electoral College count in 2020, many Democrats and supporters of Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/democrats-attempts-to-deny-trump-are-rejected-in-joint-session.html\">did the same in 2016</a>.</p><p>\"The effort concluded with a TV media blitz before the Dec. 19 Electoral College vote and a claim that the <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/governor-declares-no-constitutional-right-walk-around-without-mask/\" target=\"_blank\">Constitution</a> called for the Electoral College to reject a candidate like Trump,\" wrote Pudner. \"Protesters trying to stop electors from casting their votes chanted 'shame' after they did, as shown in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h38QAO60SI&ab_channel=TMJ4News\" target=\"_blank\">TV report</a>.\"</p><p>Voters heard many of the same arguments: The results were not legitimate and the Electoral College should act to deny the projected winner the presidency. When the Electoral College voted in line with their states, some Democratic lawmakers in 2017, just like some Republican lawmakers in 2021, objected to the results in certain states.</p><p>Granted, given the events of Wednesday, January 6, it cannot be said the response in 2016 and the response in 2020 were entirely the same. Pudner, a conservative Republican who voted for Trump, acknowledged this point in an interview with me. The startling reality, he observed, is most of the people who stormed the US Capitol on January 6 truly believed the election was stolen.</p><p>He added that if any silver lining could be taken away from these events, it was that more people recognized immediately upon viewing the rioting and violence that \"this is something that seriously has to be addressed.\"</p><p>\"We cannot continue to have people building up this anger on completely false information that they're believing because it is going to boil over and some are going to act on it,\" he said.</p><blockquote>\"If you are going to convince 50 million people that the election was stolen, most of them are not going to do anything, but among those 50 million you are going to find the ones who are crazy enough to take a shot at someone or accost somebody. We're in a scary moment. The only silver lining is I think it woke everyone up.\"</blockquote><p><strong>Check out more from my excellent interview with John Pudner, whose organization is dedicated to building broad coalitions to strengthen the integrity of elections through reform, in the podcast embedded above. </strong></p><p>We need to have a discussion on how we got here that goes beyond what Republicans and Democrats are talking about -- or willing to talk about. There are legitimate problems with the US&nbsp;democratic process, but it is important to identify the legitimate source of those problems to know how best to strengthen confidence in our elections.</p><p>There are many voters, both in and outside Trump’s sphere of support, who are frustrated and disenchanted with an electoral process that serves those in power, and there are party loyalists and other people who seek to exploit this disenchantment for their own gain. It is important to take a step back and examine this as objective observers, which admittedly, is not easy in the current political environment. People are selective on who they listen to and who they trust. People want to confirm the biases they have because that allows them to remain in their comfort zone and ensures they are always on the side of “right.”</p><p>Ignoring these issues, however, and the root cause of them or shrugging them off will likely only lead to further problems down the road.</p><h2>First, We Need to Define ‘Election Integrity’</h2><p>When discussing election integrity it is important to understand what that means. Some organizations use it in their name or branding to push an agenda or it is used in a talking point to elicit a response.</p><p>The policymakers who objected to the certification of the Electoral College votes on January 6 said they were doing it to preserve election integrity. Many of the arguments we see made on misconduct or fraud in relation to the 2020 election are made on these grouds as well.</p><p>But at a fundamental level, what does it (or should it) actually mean?</p><p>Integrity is a quality of being honest, fair, consistent, and upholding high ethical standards. So, by its very definition, election integrity means having an electoral process that adheres to these values.</p><p>Do we believe elections in the US are fair? Do we believe they are honest? Do we believe they uphold high ethical standards? Judging by the state of the US political environment, many people will on one point or another answer “no.”</p><p>Oftentimes the discussion over the integrity of elections focuses on the administration of elections. The most common complaints about the 2020 process were over ballot signature verification and errors in tabulation.</p><p>Signature verification was a topic of concern during much of the 2020 election cycle as election officials predicted an unprecedented number of absentee votes would be cast in the general election. They were right. Turnout shattered records at all levels and demographics.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump suggested states like Nevada, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/80-million-americans-may-vote-mail-election-here-s-how-n1243377\">wouldn’t verify signatures</a>. “There’s no verification,” he said. “It is a disgrace this could happen.” This claim, however, was <a href=\"https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=8842\">disputed</a> by the Nevada secretary of state.</p><p>Still, the sheer volume of mail-in ballots is something that raised concerns among members of both parties. If the concern was not over whether or not every voter would have a chance to cast a ballot safely and securely, it was that the process would be abused.</p><p>Many Trump supporters argued that the increased use of absentee voting was ripe with misconduct. They argued that the 2020 process was not conducted honestly or fairly for Mr. Trump. Sworn affidavits suggest tampering with ballots, duplicate signatures, over-voting, missing signatures, and those charged with counting and certifying the results allowed widespread fraud to occur.</p><p>The counter-argument is that election officials and the courts have upheld the honesty and fairness of the results, and that many of the affidavits that have made it into the court system have been tossed and there is no evidence to support claims of widespread fraud -- thus they defend the integrity of the system.</p><p>The truth is, both sides are missing something critical to understanding the real integrity problems that exist within the US electoral process. However,&nbsp; before I go further into this point, let’s take a deeper dive into some of the arguments challenging the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.</p><h2>Point and Counterpoint to Accusations of a Rigged 2020 Election</h2><p>In the more widespread arguments against the election results, devoted Trump supporters point to what they believe is incontrovertible evidence that Mr. Trump was cheated, and thus question the legitimacy and integrity of the entire 2020 process.</p><p>For example, NTD Cable News, an affiliate of the Epoch Times, posted videos on YouTube that suggest hundreds of thousands of votes were removed from President Trump or switched to Joe Biden in two key battleground states.&nbsp;</p><p>Members of the “Data Integrity Group” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKiyAy9vjrk\">testified</a> in a Georgia Senate subcommittee hearing that over 30,000 Trump votes were removed and others were switched to Biden. The same group also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM8pC1pAizc\">made the case</a> that over 423,000 votes were removed for Trump in Pennsylvania.</p><p>The core of the arguments made were that individuals with access to election software switched whole batches of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden at some point in the transit process of moving SD cards with the vote totals and transferring the data over multiple servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Altering the software used, they argue, led to Trump losing votes.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.repdiamond.com/News/18754/Latest-News/PA-Lawmakers-Numbers-Don%E2%80%99t-Add-Up,-Certification-of-Presidential-Results-Premature-and-In-Error\">17 Republican state legislators</a> sponsored and participated in an election analysis that they say shows over 200,000 more votes were counted than actually cast in the state. Thus, these lawmakers say the election results should not have been certified.</p><p>“A comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted. Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates,” stated State Rep Frank Ryan.</p><p>“The difference of 202,377 more votes cast than voters voting, together with the 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, adds up to an alarming discrepancy of 170,830 votes, which is more than twice the reported statewide difference between the two major candidates for President of the United States”.</p><p>The analysis, according to State Rep. Frank Ryan, compared official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3 as recorded by the Department of State.</p><p>There are also the <a href=\"https://hamodia.com/2020/11/11/rnc-chair-says-11000-people-shown-voter-fraud-claims/\">hundreds of sworn affidavits</a> that the Trump campaign and Republican Party leaders point to as further evidence of misconduct during the election. As an example of the damning allegations, party chair Ronna McDaniel said in an interview with Fox News that:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A person in Wayne County, Michigan alleged that 60% of a batch of ballots had the same signature on them;</li><li>Another person said 35 ballots were counted despite not being cast by registered voters; and</li><li>Another person said 50 ballots were counted multiple times in a tabulation machine elsewhere</li></ul><p>And this is barely the tip of the iceberg. One of bigger <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.283580/gov.uscourts.gand.283580.7.1_2.pdf\">affidavits</a>, however, filed in court alleged substantial amounts of overvotes in Michigan, up to 350% turnout in some cases.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of claims and allegations out there is, in truth, quite overwhelming for a single individual to sift through. There is so much information that it is easy for a person to get lost in it all, and all of these claims focus on misconduct in the administration of elections.</p><p>For many Trump supporters, there is plenty to call into question the integrity of the 2020 election.</p><p>On the other side of this conversation, however, are not only Democrats and opponents to Trump, but chief elections administrators in the spotlighted battleground states, election experts, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who say these claims are largely unfounded and outlandish.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, not much can be found on the “Data Integrity Group,” which alleged substantial numbers of votes were removed from Trump in Pennsylvania and Georgia. And, some have pointed out that the person who led these efforts in Pennsylvania and Georgia, Lynda McLaughlin, is an <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynda-mclaughlin-702b569/\">executive producer for conservative radio and TV host Sean Hannity</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More important to note, though, is that Georgia <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/07/politics/georgia-recount-recertification-biden/index.html\">conducted a statewide audit that revealed no irregularities and a hand recount</a>, meaning the votes were tallied a total of 3 times. Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperge has repeatedly said he stands by the results and that they were “counted accurately, fairly, and reliably.\"</p><p>One of the points individuals who presented on behalf of the “Data Integrity Group” based their broader argument on was the overwhelming percentage by which Biden won several precincts in certain counties. They suggested that a candidate receiving 90%+ of the vote in a precinct was abnormal and an indicator of fraud.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is important to note that in heavily partisan areas, this happens quite often.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/election-2016-voting-precinct-maps.html\">2016 map</a> for a moment. Any county with the deepest shades of red (almost burgundy) and blue (essentially navy blue) have several precincts in which Trump or Clinton won with 90%+ (sometimes nearly 100%) of the vote. It is not as abnormal as one, on the surface, might think or suggest.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, the Department of State <a href=\"https://wjactv.com/news/local/pa-republican-lawmakers-analysis-finds-presidential-election-numbers-dont-add-up\">refuted the claims</a> made by State Rep. Frank Ryan, stating that his press release rehashed, “with the same lack of evidence and the same absence of supporting documentation, repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories regarding the November 3 election.”</p><p>Speaking specifically to the discrepancy in total votes cast, the department wrote:</p><blockquote>“We are unclear as to what data the legislators used for this most recent 'analysis.' But the only way to determine the number of voters who voted in November from the SURE system is through the vote histories. At this time, there are still a few counties that have not completed uploading their vote histories to the SURE system. These counties, which include Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, would account for a significant number of voters. The numbers certified by the counties, not the uploading of voter histories into the SURE system, determines the ultimate certification of an election by the secretary.”</blockquote><p>Many who rebuff the election results turn to the sheer number of sworn affidavits that have been submitted alleging misconduct, ballot tampering, and/or fraud. The quantity has been more of a focus than the substance of those affidavits.</p><p>Though there are hundreds of affidavits, many of them are unavailable because they have not been filed in actual lawsuits. However, many of the ones that have been used in lawsuits have been tossed by judges as inadmissible or not credible.</p><p>One <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/20/trump-campaigns-much-hyped-affidavit-features-big-glaring-error/\">report</a> examined the affidavit about Michigan’s vote count, finding that the data used was actually from Minnesota, and the Minnesota locations used are not backed up by data from the Minnesota Secretary of State.</p><p>There have reportedly been 60+ lawsuits pertaining to the outcome of the 2020 election, and thus far the courts -- from the state level to the US Supreme Court -- have yet to determine that there is a legitimate legal argument that the outcome was fraudulent.</p><p>This is why it is important to take a step back and look at this as an objective observer. It is possible to consider and look into claims of election misconduct with an open mind without simply casting them aside as conspiracy theories.</p><p>However, when evidence is presented that refutes claims of misconduct, it is important to consider the counter-argument and points with an equally open mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that an outright refusal to acknowledge and thoroughly consider potential threats to the integrity of US elections can do just as much damage to the electoral process as entertaining falsehoods about the administration of elections, because it would allow genuine threats to public confidence in the process to continue and get worse.</p><p>To clarify, though, <strong>both</strong> pose a risk to the integrity of the elections. This is why the conversation cannot be treated in absolute terms -- i.e. a person is either all-in on one side of the argument or they are all-in on the other.&nbsp;<strong>This us-vs-them mindset is a major problem with the mainstream partisan narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We need to be willing to examine legitimate threats to public confidence and the integrity of elections while at the same time call out efforts to disrupt or overturn a legitimate election outcome to serve the private interests of a single party -- or a single person.</p><p>Donald Trump repeatedly made <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-repeated-false-attacks-on-mail-in-ballots/\">false and unfounded claims</a> about the administration of elections during the 2020 campaign, particularly on the subject of mail-in voting and signature verification.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that does not mean every point he made was without merit or worth deeper consideration because one thing he did well in 2016 was bring in support from voters, both in and outside the party apparatus, who have lost confidence in the electoral process.</p><h2>Ballot Harvesting: A Threat to the Legitimacy of Elections?</h2><p>Donald Trump repeatedly contended in rallies and on Twitter that ‘ballot harvesting’ would open the floodgates to fraud and election misconduct in the 2020 process with the expansion of vote-by-mail access in nearly every state. Ballot harvesting is now a popular colloquialism for ballot collection, in which individuals or organizations collect and return ballots from voters who can’t return their ballot themselves or otherwise prefer to let someone else take care of it.</p><p>There are several states that restrict the persons allowed to return a ballot on behalf of a voter -- typically limited to family members or members of a voter’s household. However, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_harvesting_laws_by_state\">according to Ballotpedia</a>, as of August 2020, “24 states and D.C. permitted someone chosen by the voter to return mail ballots on their behalf in most cases.”</p><p>There are some important asterisks that could be placed next to Ballotpedia’s number. Each state has their own unique laws and some states, such as Alaska, send specific ballots to individuals who have qualified special needs, and these voters can designate an individual to return their ballot for them.</p><p>The type of ballot harvesting Mr. Trump railed against, however, is the collection practice in which any individual or group can collect as many ballots from as many voters as they want without restriction. This type of ballot collection is illegal in several states. However, it is by law legal in a state like California.</p><p>The use of ballot harvesting in California drew national attention for its election practices. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order that would require all registered voters in the state to receive a ballot, which was contested <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2020/05/california-shutdown-lawsuits-newsom-dhillon-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-executive-orders/?\">in lawsuits</a> filed by Republicans. California also extended the window by which ballots postmarked by election day could be delivered to county registrars to 17 days.</p><p>However, a state law that essentially allows unmitigated ballot harvesting <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/elections-campaigns-california-house-elections-political-parties-5164975b80132942d55cc2377e767fc0\">drew scrutiny</a> both in and outside the state. Under California law, anyone can return a ballot on behalf of any voter for any reason as long as:</p><ul><li>They do not receive compensation for the amount of ballots collected;</li><li>Sign the ballot envelope and state their relationship to the voter; and</li><li>Return ballots collected in-person or put them in the mail no later than 3 days from the date the ballots were received.</li></ul><p>However, it is worth noting that a ballot won’t be disqualified if it is returned after the 3 day deadline or if the collector doesn’t sign it as long as it is returned by election day -- making the requirements basically pointless.</p><p>California law didn’t always allow this. Prior to 2016, if a voter was unable to return a ballot themselves, only a designated family member or person living in the same household could return the ballot. The law was expanded in 2016 under <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1921\">Assembly Bill 1921</a>.</p><p>Political Data Inc. Vice President Paul Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article246424595.html\">commented to the Sacramento Bee</a> that the law is most commonly used for individuals to help other individuals deliver their ballot, and is not as often used by organizations. However, critics have raised concerns over the last couple of years over the potential for partisan machinations.&nbsp;</p><p>Republican leaders <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/3cfd93f7859149809949bd611287154e\">specifically linked ballot harvesting</a> to the strong blue wave that swept over the state in 2018. The argument focused specifically on competitive districts where Republicans looked to have an advantage in the early count but later counted ballots shifted the advantage to Democrats and led to Democratic victories.&nbsp;</p><p>In Orange County, which was previously considered a GOP stronghold, former GOP US Rep. Mimi Walters ended election night with a 6,200 lead, but as votes continued to be tallied after election night her opponent, Katie Porter, took 58% of the remaining votes, which propelled her to victory.</p><p>The story sounds familiar, right? The votes tallied on election night showed one result but as the votes continued to be tallied after election night, the outcome ended up being a different story. That is not, by itself, an indicator of fraud. The ballots were always there; it just took time to count them.</p><p>California has for many elections taken a long time to count millions of ballots after Election Day, something Republican leaders across California and critics of ballot harvesting have pounced on, claiming the extended time to count ballots opens the door for election misconduct. California election officials dispute these claims,</p><p>Yet, when it comes to ballot harvesting, those who oppose its use are not wrong. The potential does indeed exist for party shenanigans and misconduct.</p><p>Something else California made <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-california/california-republicans-push-back-in-ballot-drop-box-dispute-idUSKBN2700BU\">national headlines</a> in 2020 for was the emergence of ballot drop boxes that were put in place by the Republican Party, and were not officially sanctioned by a county registrar’s office. Party leaders argued that drop boxes put up by volunteers or parties were a legal form of ballot collection and they were merely playing by the rules that the Democrats wrote.</p><p>“This is just another form of me going door to door,” he said. “When I go door to door, I can get those ballots and put it in a bag, whether it’s a trash bag or a box that I get from Ikea,” said GOP spokesperson Hector Barajas.</p><p>California officials, including Secretary of State Alex Padilla, contested the notion that what the Republican Party was doing was ‘legal.’ He and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra asserted that California law requires anyone returning a ballot, whether it is the voter or a person on their behalf, to use means sanctioned by county officials to do so.</p><p>Interesting to note, Paul Mitchell (mentioned above) commented that there would have been no legal dispute if there was a person standing in place of the drop boxes. Meaning, under state law, a person could just stand on the street corner and collect ballots as long as voters are willing to give them their ballots.</p><p>And, there is nothing in state law that suggests otherwise, as long as those ballots are returned to county voting centers, polling locations, or placed in officially sanctioned drop boxes by election day. If this sounds like a system that opens itself up for abuse, that’s because it easily is.</p><p>In the end, the California GOP <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/california-gop-agrees-to-remove-unofficial-ballot-drop-boxes-or-did-they/\">agreed to remove the drop boxes</a>, though some GOP lawmakers suggested they would continue to be deployed and President Donald Trump openly encouraged their use. It is clear how in an electoral environment that is focused on who wins and who loses between two sides, the ballot harvesting law was used to play partisan games.</p><p>Looking outside California, the most egregious machination in recent history was in North Carolina, where a political operative was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/30/746800630/north-carolina-gop-operative-faces-new-felony-charges-that-allege-ballot-fraud\">charged with multiple felonies </a>for illegally possessing and tampering with ballots during the 2018 general election for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District.</p><p>Ballot harvesting, as it is in California, is illegal in North Carolina. It is a Class I felony for anyone other than a near relative or legal guardian to return a voter’s ballot when that person is unable to return it themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, Leslie McCrae Dowless -- along with others working for him -- illegally collected (and potentially filled out) people’s ballots and then had his co-conspirators state they saw the voter vote absentee. The North Carolina elections board refused to certify the results of the election and a new election was scheduled.</p><p>It is case-in-point, however, for the potential for mischief and misconduct through the practice of ballot collection. There is certainly a difference between the law in California and the law in North Carolina, but it is easy to see how the threat of tit-for-tat partisan schemes is easier when ballot harvesting is legal.&nbsp;</p><p>One side will claim it is merely playing the game the other side started or escalated with little to no consequences.</p><p>It is important to note that there is no evidence of a widespread problem with ballot harvesting in the US, and claims of ballot harvesting affecting the outcome of previous elections in California in any type of fraudulent manner are broadly disputed. The process is illegal in several states, and incidents like what happened in North Carolina are a rare exception to the rule.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the idea of ballot harvesting shakes public confidence in the process. People see the potential for fraud and the damaging impact nefarious schemes, either by an individual or party, can have on the fairness and integrity of the democratic process, and there is merit to this perception.</p><p>Thus, a system that allows an unmitigated practice of ballot harvesting should be discouraged.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Real Threat to Election Integrity Comes from a Duopoly-Controlled Process</h2><p>As mentioned before, when it comes to the topic of integrity in the election process,&nbsp; much of the focus is on the administration of elections -- mail-in voting, signature verification, vote tabulation, the transfer of votes from the county level to the state level.&nbsp;</p><p>One side says there was misconduct after the 2020 presidential election in how ballots were handled and tallied. The other side says the facts suggest otherwise, thus there is not a problem.</p><p>In the eyes of the courts, there wasn’t a legitimate legal argument made that fraud took place. Election officials on both sides of the aisle defend how the ballot counting was administered and the results, and say the process was fair and transparent. </p><p>There is no reason to rationally think the results were not legitimate.</p><p>There is an inherent and critical danger, however, to the integrity of the US political process. But, it is a danger that runs deeper and is more systematic than both sides acknowledge or are willing to admit to and has existed and festered over many years.</p><p>Remember the definition of election integrity. It means having an electoral process that is&nbsp; honest, fair, consistent, and upholds high ethical standards. Now consider the electoral system we have and who it is designed to serve.</p><p>Elections in a democratic form of government should represent the interests of the public. Citizens elect public officials and representatives to make policy and govern on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the US electoral process doesn’t serve the public interest of ensuring the needs of voters and the public at-large are represented in the halls of government. US elections are designed to serve the private interests of the Republican and Democratic Parties.&nbsp;</p><p>The primaries, for example, give the parties and their members an advantage in the process by being able to pick for everyone else who they get to vote for, while at the same time dividing the electorate between “Team Red” and “Team Blue” from the onset of the electoral season.</p><p>The nation’s electoral maps are drawn by legislators to preserve and grow the power of the partisan majority, creating safe seats where incumbents only have to worry about a primary challenge to win, and eliminating the need to actually compete for voters.</p><p>As a result of the critical role primaries play in the electoral process, the incentive public officials have is to appease the most staunch ideologues of their party’s base that vote in these low turnout elections that though administered with public funds and by state and local governments, serve a private purpose.</p><p>This also enhances the power party leaders have over deciding who ultimately gets elected. After all, getting the party’s nod is the best way for a candidate to ensure they get access to the tremendous resources of their party.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, there’s more.</p><p>Ballot access laws are written to better protect the two parties from outside competition. Campaign finance laws heavily favor the two major parties and their allies. <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/ivp-amicus-to-scotus-two-party-control-of-potus-debates-elections-hurts-our-republic\">Debate rules</a> block anyone but Republicans and Democrats from appearing before the public.</p><p>Campaign finance, in particular, is a major area of concern among voters. In a 2018 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll <a href=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/today/z_creative/18955%20NBCWSJ%20September%20Poll.pdf\">77% of respondents</a> said “reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington” was at least somewhat important in deciding who to vote for in congressional elections.</p><p>However, many voters may not know that the parties control the largest flow of money in US elections -- a flow that is unlimited between party committees and campaigns. Many voters may also not be aware that the agencies designed to enforce campaign finance and federal election laws, like the Federal Election Commission, have been designed in such a way that it is now impossible for them to move on anything in a hyper-polarized political environment.</p><p>\"For those who don't know, the FEC board is comprised of 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats, so generally they cancel each other out and won't rule on violations,\" said John Pudner, whose organization (<a href=\"https://takeback.org/\">Take Back Our Republic</a>)&nbsp;focuses on several reform issues, but their biggest focus is on the rules that allow so much money toflow into the nation's politics.</p><p>How can we enforce the integrity of or elections when the very agency tasked with ruling on alleged violations has been set up to fail because of the deep divide that has grown between the two major parties?</p><p>And, it isn’t just money the parties hang over campaigns.&nbsp;They also control the biggest transfer of voter data -- data on <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-01-big-parties-voters.html\">all US voters</a>. They decide which candidates get access to this data and to what extent they get access.</p><p>To reiterate, the system was designed at every level to serve the private interests of the Republican and Democratic Parties, and the people who create and enforce these rules are loyal members of the parties themselves. The parties are the gatekeepers of our elections and they intend to keep it that way.</p><p>A system that serves a two-party duopoly guarantees elections are a zero-sum contest between two -- and only two -- sides. What matters most in elections is not policy, or issues, or even voters. It is who wins and who loses between “Team Red” and “Team Blue.”</p><p>Everyone else involved in the US <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf\">political industry</a>, as one should think of it, falls in line with this model in order to survive in it. The media treats politics as a spectator sport, pollsters give US citizens two options from which to choose, and even academics reinforce the status quo.</p><p>The parties, thus the media and the national narrative, put elections in terms of consequences, but not the consequences of what the rhetoric on the campaign trail or proposed policies might have on the country, but the consequence of winners and losers.</p><p>This type of consequentialist ethics perpetually raises the stakes in each election cycle. For my side to win, how can I ensure the other side loses? And, when the other side raises the stakes against my side, how can I raise them even further?</p><p>Think about any policy conflict, for a moment. When nothing changes, it is always the other side’s fault. It is the other side that refuses to bend or compromise. It is the other side that is blocking legislation or is attempting to derail progress. The other side started this conflict, so they are to blame for any action taken by either side.</p><p>Anything wrong with the nation is always the other side’s fault and voters need to see it that way.&nbsp;</p><p>The stakes have risen to such extremes that both sides claim the other is an existential threat to the country. The “other side,” in one way or another, is presented as a threat to your safety and/or your rights and will usher in the destruction of the republic. “They” will lie, cheat, and steal their way to victory, thus defeating “them” at any cost is for the good of the nation.</p><p>The inflated ego of leaders of both major parties is they have to win, at any cost, and it has expanded their sense of entitlement from not only control over the process itself, which has resulted in tens of millions of voters either disenchanted or disenfranchised completely, but over winning itself. And, if they don't win, that must mean the other side cheated or engaged in nefarious misconduct of some kind to rob them of that victory.</p><p>Case-in-point, we've had two consecutive presidential election cycles that have been challenged by members of both parties. Instead of respecting the will of voters, the parties insert their own sense of entitlement to power.</p><p>And, we’re not just talking about the extremely polarized rhetoric on the campaign trail, but also how members of both parties approach policy and reform to the process. Everything has to be put in terms of which side benefits. Support or opposition to reforms to how elections are conducted, like elections, comes down to who wins, thus the two parties scheme on ways that give them a leg up on the “other side.”</p><p>Ballot harvesting in California, for instance, was put in terms of which side gains rather than a big picture look at how such practices affect public confidence in the process and what partisan schemes can emerge as a result.</p><p>Members of the Democratic establishment in New York City use <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/how-andrew-yang-could-end-the-political-monopoly-in-nyc\">the same arguments</a> against an alternative voting method like ranked choice voting approved by a majority -- in this case an overwhelming majority -- of voters as Republicans will use in Maine if it is perceived as a threat to the power to which they think they are entitled.</p><p>Republicans may fight just as hard to close primaries <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/republicans-push-for-closed-primaries-in-missouri/article_4190b4cc-72c0-5d8c-8c47-b8db5cde7156.html\">in states</a> where they have the most political power as Democrats might <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2013/07/11/democratic-party-of-hawaii-files-lawsuit-to-close-primaries/\">in states</a> where they control the branches of government. Both argue that the other side will scheme to weaken the opposing party, while no attention is given to how elections empower voters and given them a level playing field to decide who represents them.</p><p>There is perhaps no better featured example of this, though, than how both parties use gerrymandering to their favor when they have the political majority. Republicans scheme to draw maps that benefit them in states like Texas just as hard as Democrats scheme to draw maps that benefit them in states like Maryland.</p><p>Both sides claim to be the true champions of integrity, but does the electoral system they have fostered truly sound like it prioritizes integrity? Substance is lost. Solutions aren’t important. Voters don’t matter. The only thing that matters is “Team Red” and “Team Blue,” and who comes out the winner.</p><p>An electoral process that promises to be “of, by, and for the people,” but fails to deliver on that promise is not honest, it is not fair, it is not consistent, and it does not uphold high ethical standards, because US public officials are accountable to private, gain-seeking interests above all else. We do not have a system that truly encourages integrity.</p><p>If we want to ensure and strengthen public confidence and trust in the electoral process then we need broad systemic reforms that ensure accountability to the public. A fair, competitive process that shifts the incentive for public officials to put the interests of voters above the interests of their parties or other special interests is the only way to ensure honest elections.<br></p>","name":"The Conversation on Election Integrity Neither Party Wants You to Hear","slug":"the-conversation-on-election-integrity-neither-party-wants-you-to-hear","topics-new":"5d2cdfbcf786224ea62087b7","author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"updated-on":"2021-01-15T16:44:10.529Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2021-01-12T17:34:30.078Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2021-01-15T16:44:10.529Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","teaser":"Challenging the legitimacy of elections in the elections is becoming more of a norm than many people might realize.

Those people aren’t going to disappear, and neither are their interests, values, beliefs, and passions. In fact, they’re only going to become more vocal now that they feel embattled, surrounded, and cornered by people who see things drastically different than they do. Remember how the left couldn’t stop yacking for the last four years? It’s going to be that from the right now. Thanks for playing.<br></p><p>Remember no sooner had Donald Trump won in 2016 than did anti-Trump Democrats mobilize at warp speed to register their opposition. Cue <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women's_March\">the 2017 Women’s March, which happened on Jan 21, 2017,&nbsp; the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration</a>. It drew nearly half a million attendees in Washington DC and over 5 million more nationwide. Meanwhile, the heavily Democrat-aligned corporate news media delved into endless Russia conspiracy theories, and breathless coverage of Trump’s administration in a thick blanket cover of doom, gloom, and despair.</p><p>They kept pressing the gas harder in this direction for four years straight.</p><h2>What To Expect From&nbsp;Tea Party 2.0<br></h2><p>From the Tea Party 2.0 you can expect the same rush for solace that all parties out of power indulge-- into all kinds of bizarre conspiracy theories. You can expect more eschatological, the sky is falling, the end is near, we’ll all be judged, we’re all doomed-- kind of talk.</p><p>But I’m not bagging on the right. To some degree I confess I perversely cherish this kind of theatrical big tent revival circus show that grips so much of US politics. You guys are all nuts on both sides. Hello, climate change alarmists: <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2019/01/22/ocasio-cortez-climate-change-alarm/2642481002/\">This you</a>?<br></p><p>Yeah, we’re talking about another serious Boston Tea Party this time around, like the one in ‘73. This won’t be just some sign waving and tri-cornered hats, then massive electoral action unseating many senior incumbent lawmakers at many levels of government across the country, like last time around. That was in ‘09 right after Barack Obama’s inauguration. It might be that too, but it’s going to be far more raucous along the way. These people are mad.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1916px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1916px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5feb568ec47b36862cc22a7c_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-29%20at%2010.16.52%20AM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><em>“Mad Hatter: \"Have I gone mad?\" Alice: \"I'm afraid so.

And after the precedent in tone and deed set by the anti-police protestors this year in their disregard for many laws and orders, we will be lucky if Tea Party 2.0 keeps it clean like the one in 2009, but if you get a good look at most of these people, you can see they aren’t looking to make trouble.<br></p><p>Still, there are very ominous portents this time around in US politics. Though I have covered the toxicity of partisan politics, especially that of the partisan duopoly in the United States, for a decade now, it is still shocking to see just how far the tension has ratcheted up. Social media platforms providing integrated instant worldwide publishing for free to anyone with a device reaching a scale of mass adoption with emergent global transformative effects we are just beginning to understand may have played a role in the hyper-polarization of US politics.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A reporter for BuzzFeed News has found what I’ve observed going to and fro throughout the center-right ecosystem online, that <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/tea-party-movement-stop-the-steal-election-results\">a lot of them are talking about secession and civil war</a>. Hopefully they’re joking. But what if they themselves don’t realize they are?<br></p><p>In 2009, there were no stabbings at Tea Party protests. Today protesters will have to brave a new left with a forward guard of <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/06/14/virginia-shooter-asked-republicans-democrats\">street thugs eager to do violence</a>. And they will have an odd group of young men (e.g. The Proud Boys) standing by with equal relish at the opportunity to throw fists over politics. There are likely going to be more bloody messes at some of these things. When I was a young man, and the protests were not so dangerous, I went to many of them in 2009 and 2010. But this time around, I have no interest in going to political events in person. There are too many weird people that want to do dangerous things out there now.&nbsp;This is unfortunate.<br></p><p>As Pro-Trump “Stop The Steal” Rallies peppered cities across the country on Dec 12,<a href=\"https://www.wkrg.com/baldwin-county/large-turnout-for-stop-the-steal-rally-in-baldwin-county/\"> from places like Mobile, Alabama</a>, all the way to the nation’s capitol,<a href=\"https://www.localdvm.com/news/counter-protests-planned-ahead-of-second-stop-the-steal-rally/\"> far-left extremists counter-protestors planned to confront the Trump supporters</a> on the streets. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/12/us/stop-the-steal-protest-washington-dc-trnd/index.html\">At the Washington DC Stop the Steal Rally, four people were stabbed and 33 arrests were made</a>. Several people were injured including several police officers. If free speech and open political discourse are important to the corporate media, they should have been more riled up about this. Instead they wrote entirely <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tapper-tweet-cnn-journalists-survived-2020-election\">unselfconscious missives patting themselves on the shoulders for surviving 2020</a>.&nbsp;Nary a word from these laurel wreathed heroes either begging the president to pardon Assange or Snowden.</p><p>Anyway these acts of violence are not likely to dam the flood of counter-reactionary political movement from a second Tea Party. If anything, these inflammatory provocations will stir more brave and outspoken people to join protests and political electioneering movements for insurgent Tea Party candidates. What will the Second 21st Century Tea Party look like? Let’s take a look back at the first one so we have something appropriately similar to map it on to.<br></p><h2>The 2009 Anti-Bush-Obama-Bailouts Tea Party</h2><p>The Tea Party was not the spawn of Fox News’ Richard Murdoch and the Koch Brothers Enterprises’ network of institutional policy and legal analyst muscle. It started, of all places, on CNBC, with Rick Santelli, a loud-mouthed New Yorker, a big finance guy, who had made it to a career pinnacle in financial journalism. He was standing on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and stirring up the traders into wild cheers as he trashed Obama’s mortgage bailout plan.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"640:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zp-Jw-5Kx8k\"></iframe></div></figure><p>To cheers and whistles from the crowd, he said:<br></p><blockquote>“We’re thinking of having a Chicago Tea Party in July.&nbsp;All you capitalists that want to show up to Lake Michigan, I’m going to start organizing.”<br></blockquote><p>A panelist chimed in and asked:<br></p><p><em>“What are you dumping in this time?”</em><br></p><p>Santelli answered:<br></p><p><em>“We’re dumping in derivative securities. What do you think about that?”</em>‍</p><p>These people, and soon hordes of grassroots independent political activists, with the founding principles of American government in mind, were just steamed that the taxpayer was going around bailing out businesses instead of letting the free market operate. Instead of the taxpayer buying an entire industry full of severely downgraded mortgage backed securities, they wanted to let the market line up to buy the big banks’ junk assets. That would be capitalism.<br><br>Instead Democrats and Republicans in Washington quickly got to work joining hands to pass unprecedented emergency fiscal appropriations bills to bail out massive swaths of the finance industry and provide what politicians and journalists styled stimulus relief ground out to corporate American bank accounts through the greasy channels of the politicians’ and lobbyists’ lucrative favor factory.<br><br>President George W. Bush, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson were at no odds deploying all that taxpayer money. Neither were the two party presidential candidates in 2008, Sens. Barack Obama and the late John McCain. They both voted yes for the 2008 $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout of big finance companies with taxpayer money. As much as they fight tooth and nail over every other stupid thing they can think of to fight over, when the two parties act swiftly together, the result is often something terrible for most voters.<br><br>The resulting political backlash began as a sprinkling of protests around the United States at the end of February 2009, days after Rick Santelli’s first call for a Chicago Tea Party in July. It grew quickly to an enormous number of cities with massive crowd turnouts for an April 15 Tax Day Tea Party. Then on July 4th the number and size of the Tea Party protests had become a tidal wave of grassroots political mobilization.<br>‍</p><p>Here’s how the Tea Party looked in Houston on Feb 27, 2009:<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"640:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgdWL8pjo6I\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgdWL8pjo6I\"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Here’s the NYC Tea Party on Feb 28, 2009 in tragically low quality audio / video:<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"640:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmiDlTKLKI0\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmiDlTKLKI0\"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Here’s Them in Cincinnati in March 2009:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"640:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBSlfuY8Q5g \"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBSlfuY8Q5g\"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Here’s the 9/12 2009 Tea Party March on Washington DC:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUPMjC9mq5Y\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUPMjC9mq5Y\"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Here’s Houston by the Tax Day Tea Parties in 2009:<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"640:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t92OCES2DfA\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t92OCES2DfA\"></iframe></div></figure><p>&nbsp;Guitar playing, spitting some red pills about the partisan duopoly.<br><br>Today history is happening all over again, just that soon too.

If appropriations under this bill overshoot outlays, as they did with the 2009 Obama / Democrats stimulus package, add another $100 billion by the time it’s all said and done.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br>What does this spending include?<br>‍<br>Before offering a list of highlights, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqBhY89vOg\">watch President Donald Trump read this litany of horrors</a> from the most recent emergency stimulus relief appropriation...<br><br>Then remember he signed the following.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/addressing-the-other-covid-crisis-corruption/\">In the CARES Act, which Trump signed on Mar 27, there was</a>, according to the Brookings Institution:<br></p><blockquote>“...reports that 27 clients of Trump-connected lobbyists have received up to $10.5 billion of that spending; that beneficiaries have also included multiple entities linked to the family of Jared Kushner and other Trump associates and political allies; that up to $273 million was awarded to more than 100 companies that are owned or operated by major donors to Trump’s election efforts.”<br></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2020/03/26/is-there-wasteful-spending-in-the-coronavirus-stimulus-bill/?sh=1aa43d2f60ae\">A writer at Forbes also notes further regarding the CARES Act</a>:</p><blockquote>‘-$25 million in the Senate bill went to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. During the past ten years, the center received $68.3 million in federal grants (2010-2019). The Kennedy Center has total assets of $557 million. The Pelosi bill earmarked $35 million.</blockquote><blockquote>-$75 million in the Senate bill funded the Corporation For Public Broadcasting. Why do National Public Radio and Big Bird get a coronavirus subsidy? The Pelosi bill allocated $300 million.</blockquote><blockquote>-$1.2 billion in the Pelosi bill to require airlines to purchase expensive “renewable” jet fuel. It was $200 million per year in grants (2021-2026) to “develop, transport, and store sustainable aviation fuels that would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.” The Senate bill eliminated this provision.’<br></blockquote><p>This is just public funding looting during what these politicians say is an existential public health crisis. How can this be permitted by American citizens or their representatives?<br><br>And how can rank-and-file Democrats not do a double take at how easily the Trump operation in Washington soaked up so much money from the CARES Act with Nancy Pelosi in control of the US House of Representatives. Can any Democrat explain how they’re happy with that?<br><br>She tore up the speech at the State of the Union Address, but hands the bag to him like this when the chips are down? Who are these party leaders really working for?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Well, we might ask that question to CNBC’s Brian Schwartz. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/biden-inaugural-committee-unveils-fundraising-packages.html\">On Dec 16, the anniversary of the 1773 Boston Tea Party, he reported for CNBC, in an article headlined</a>, “<strong>Biden inaugural committee unveils fundraising packages offering access for big donations</strong>,” that:<br></p><blockquote>“Joe Biden’s inaugural committee is sending out fundraising packages to donors, offering access at an event that will likely be largely virtual.</blockquote><blockquote>The inaugural committee is offering four packages to donors, depending on how much they give, according to a list of fundraising options provided to CNBC.</blockquote><blockquote>An organization can be named a chair of the inaugural if it gives $1 million. An individual will get the same rank with a $500,000 donation.”<br></blockquote><p>Largely virtual. He doesn’t even have to shake their dirty hands or smell their dirty breath. He doesn’t even have to be doing the event. It could be Kamala Harris deep faked as Biden to their screen. This is going to be the cushiest presidency gig ever, as good as being Ellen Degeneres ordering people home backstage at Ellen so she doesn’t have to smell them. The supreme irony being that President-elect Joe Biden is the most famous person in history for having a prolific record of absolutely <em>loving</em> to touch and smell people. This might actually be his own personal hell, a giant oval office shaped cookie to eat, the best cookie in the world, and no milk to wash it down. I mean really, what’s the point of being president if you can’t body surf over a crowd of supporters and give people little shoulder rubs and squeezes and whisper in their ears as you float by?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:960px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"960px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5feb5e22c9c33132cc4eb326_c7bc8cafaeeb2346408d29ee63762308.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Sir Ian McKellen feels Biden's pain.</figcaption></figure><p>You’ll hear rank-and-file Democrats bash Citizens United and money in politics, but look at what the guy you voted for is doing. He put together a coalition of corporate supporters / favor-seekers ramming money into politics with a sure hope of return on their investment. How’s that any better than what partisan Democrats say they’re against? Joe Biden’s ascendency sure bears the stamp of Obama’s, a swell of popular partisan pride over a heavily corporate and establishment-backed figurehead, with overt intentions of presiding over a broad mainstream corporate special interest consensus. Is this really better than Donald Trump?<br></p><p>And now that Donald Trump is out of the way, Democrats are going to have to talk about policy at some point. They don’t have him as this overwhelming, relentless distraction and lightning rod for attention. He’s been defeated. He won’t be president anymore. They’re going to have to talk about Joe Biden now, maybe a lot more than they yet understand they have bargained for, and the hangover from this inebriated dalliance with one former vice president and career senator from Delaware is going to be long and uncomfortable for Democrats. Meanwhile, it will be a cozy warm firestorm of political upheaval with a serving of hot tea from the right.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>As you heard from the list of appropriation line items President Trump read out in the video linked above, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/16/congress-stimulus-checks-relief/\">the second emergency stimulus package</a>, which features as its gimmick a pared down personal check of $600, is pork jammed into pork squeezed next to pork on top of pork.<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/27/trump-stimulus-shutdown-congress/\"> He broke down and signed it.</a> These marauders are just raiding the global economy through the US fiscal appropriation and monetary system.

Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) in 2010 and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) in 2012.<br></p><p>In 2021 the Tea Party will also push back with both partisan ferocity and earnest weariness against 2020’s state of perpetual emergency and drastic, rapidly escalating set of unprecedented radical policy interventions culminating in a command-and-control society never before seen in America at a municipal, county, state, and federal / macro level of US government under the auspices of mitigating damage from the most recent outbreak of SARS coronavirus in China.</p><p>A decade ago, Rick Santelli jokingly suggested throwing derivative securities into lake Michigan for his Chicago Tea Party. Of course that is impossible, these things are abstract contracts between different parties. But this time around anti-lockdown protests presage a second Tea Party wave starting in 2021 as well as the pro-Trump demonstrations after the election.</p><p>And they have something physical to toss overboard: face masks. But instead of throwing substantial amounts of them away, they’re making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_America_protest\">like a 1960s feminist with a bra</a>-- and symbolically burning them. Expect more antics with masks from the second Tea Party.</p><p>If you’re one of those readers who’s inclined to have any bright ideas of your own by this point, please keep it safe. No more fires, please, patriots. As I said earlier, I think you’re crazy just to go to a political demonstration in person in 2020.<br></p><p>In Manhattan, New York City, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/anti-lockdown-protesters-burn-masks-manhattan-new-york-covid-cases-highest-1549440\">over a hundred anti-lockdown demonstrators gathered to burn face masks</a> in November. In Delray Beach, Florida, in October before the election, <a href=\"https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/coronavirus/florida-group-holds-mask-burning-protest-in-response-to-re-extended-facial-covering-mandate\">“Reopen South Florida” marched for that purpose, and burned face masks as well</a>. Onlookers may say these smatterings of anti-lockdown and anti-election result protests are small and there aren’t very many of them. </p><p>But that’s how the 2009 Tea Party started as well, small with only a hundred people at some of them, and not very many of them. Then it grew very quickly in a matter of weeks into a massive political movement with lasting consequences in US politics. President Donald Trump, who started his Twitter account in 2009, must have been watching the Tea Party closely. He fluently verbalized much of its sense and feeling about the world and the US government.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/527225-trumps-remaking-of-the-judicial-system\">Trump also remade the US federal judiciary with judges unlike any president</a> in recent history.

There now exists an Internet with mature social media platforms in terms of the market adoption curve operating at mass scale and connecting all of us together. These were quite extraordinarily capable, but still nascent and not fully adopted in 2009. There are now entire new platforms in the full bloom of market adoption maturity that didn’t even exist yet in 2009.<br></p><p>Tea Partiers today have a choice.</p><p>They can adopt the partisan mindset of politics as warfare, of political action as warfare by non-violent means, and of their mission as a tribal conflict with existential enemies, to oust them from power. Or they can adopt the Founders’ generation mindset of politics as statecraft, of political action as an act of cultural creation through intense spiritual violence, and of their mission as the providential stewardship and caretaking of a civilization destined to be reborn even better, over and over again, for many generations from now, because of the good we made of our lives and our time in the world? Winning policy and electoral victories along the way might be important, but what’s the endgame and what’s the attitude on the way there? Is this going to be a war to win against other Americans, a fight to defeat other people? Or is this an opportunity for a civilization on the brink of unleashing unparalleled, awesome power in every direction of human endeavor to become morally awake before we really hurt ourselves or others badly with all this power?<br></p><blockquote><em>“We’re gonna mismanage this planet into armageddon if we don’t get some grown ups into the room.”</em><br>-Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital, Peter Thiel's investment firm (Joe Rogan Experience #1453)</blockquote><p><br><br></p>","name":"Another Tea Party Is Brewing: This One Will Be Stormier","teaser":"“History Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes” – Mark Twain","slug":"another-tea-party-is-brewing-this-one-will-be-stormier","hero":{"fileId":"5feb478ff2e3df4368cad1f1","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5feb478ff2e3df4368cad1f1_New%20Project%20(2).png","alt":null},"franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"topics":["5d0d36dca07cda96643a8d51"],"topics-new":"5d0d36dca07cda96643a8d51","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","author-s":["5d112fa1c8778d108da5fd18"],"updated-on":"2020-12-30T12:56:14.682Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2020-12-29T15:15:43.953Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5e225387daefb8772b46fdb1","published-on":"2020-12-30T12:56:14.682Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5feb481fdb40895bd49121b6"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"sticky":false,"publish-date":"2020-12-28T19:30:00.000Z","featured":true,"body":"<p><em>Editor's Note: This piece </em><a href=\"https://pe-ca-app.newsmemory.com/?publink=274d9909a_1343923\"><em>originally published</em></a><em> in Press-Enterprise out of Riverside, CA, and has been republished on IVN&nbsp;with permission from the author.</em></p><p>‍</p><p>Centrist solutions exist to many of California’s and our nation’s problems. Politics makes it easier to attack an opponent’s position than to advance one’s own, however. Nuance dies in the toxic environment of social media- based politics. If you’re explaining, you’re losing; and simply to rebut the demonized version of your own position qualifies as losing. Far simpler is to demonize right back.</p><p>Both major parties have given up being concerned about the federal deficit. If they ever return to considering how to bring our national budget into balance, the left proposes making corporations and wealthy “pay their fair share.” The right proposes stimulating economic growth so that tax revenues grow on the natural, while refusing any expansion of entitlements.</p><p>Proposing an increase in the cap on income subject to the payroll tax will condemn a Republican to a primary challenge. Proposing a postponement of the age at which one becomes eligible for Social Security or Medicare goes in precisely the opposite direction to the “Medicare for all” vector of Democratic Party activists.</p><p>Combining the two concepts guarantees withering attack from both directions, though it might be the only way to address entitlements: the least controllable element of federal spending.</p><p>Abortion is another example.</p><p>There are no pro-choice Republicans left in the House of Representatives. There are virtually no pro-life Democrats there either (one of the last, Congressman Dan Lipinski, was defeated in the Illinois Democratic primary this year). The Supreme Court has worked out a compromise: the state can’t refuse a woman the right to make the decision up to a point early in her pregnancy, but it can thereafter. A politician, however, must choose one of two positions: the woman has the right to control her body, or the child in the womb is a life entitled to protection.</p><p>In California, charter schools present another example. A Democrat who favors equalizing the funding between charter and other public schools can expect a primary challenge. For Republicans, an increase in supervision of charter schools must be resisted as an encroachment on parents’ rights. A middle ground would empower more oversight of poorer performing schools but greater freedom for those with better results. Yet that compromise is unachievable when the very concept of a charter school (since it is not automatically subject to a union contract) is an existential threat to the state teachers’ union, which dictates education policy to the Democratic caucus in Sacramento.</p><p>Conversely, any Republican voting to extend greater school board control is viewed as undoing exactly what makes charter schools effective and would not survive a conservative challenge.</p><p>To address greenhouse gases, the left orthodoxy is to cap emissions. The right orthodoxy is to cast doubt on whether human activity is a principal cause. Most economists realize a carbon tax is preferable to an arbitrary cap, but Democrats can’t vote for a tax lest they be demonized as tax-and-spend liberals. For orthodox Republicans, even cap-and-trade went too far: Assemblyman Chad Mayes was overthrown as Republican leader for this apostasy and is now the lone independent in the California Legislature.</p><p>Can we empower the embrace of sensible centrist solutions? We’ve done it before.</p><p>In 1983, President Reagan and Speaker O’Neill created a bipartisan panel to save Social Security. At the end of the Cold War, Presidents Bush and Clinton created commissions to decide which U.S. military bases were no longer needed. The common element of these two successful processes was that the decisions were made by individuals who were not running for office. Congress had to approve the package each commission eventually recommended, but the entire package was put to a yes/no vote.</p><p>No amendments were permitted. In that way, sensible compromises were enacted, without any elected official being vulnerable to extremist characterizations.</p><p>Similar approaches would work in California for many intractable issues, but it will take both independence, and independents, in the Legislature to advance them.</p>","name":"California, US Problems Need Middle-Ground Solutions","teaser":"Centrist solutions exist to many of California’s and our nation’s problems.

If you and I are in different camps, I succeed by your camp’s failure and you by mine. Anyone who doesn’t identify with this internecine co-dependence is called a ‘spoiler.’&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, since we use single-seat districts to elect our state legislatures and Congress — only one ‘camp’ can win representation in each race — meaning millions of voters each election receive no representation at all.&nbsp; Because of this, calls for structural reform have increased.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/10/opinion/house-representatives-size-multi-member.html\"> New York Times</a> and the<a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/ourcommonpurpose/report/section/3\"> American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences</a> have called for replacing the U.S. system with proportional representation elections from multi-seat legislative districts — a type of system used around the world, where seats are awarded according to the percentage of vote each party receives - and the actual diversity of political perspectives in society wins representation in proportion to those views being held among voters.</p><p>That’s why what just occurred in Alaska is so problematic</p><h2>Maine vs. Alaska’s RCV<br></h2><p>A few years ago, the state of Maine adopted ranked-choice voting (RCV)<a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/rcv.html\"> for its state and federal elections</a>, after multiple elections led to winners with less than a majority of the vote.</p><p>When used in single-seat district elections, RCV is a great improvement over current practice. RCV allows voters to rank their choices. If there is no immediate majority winner, the bottom candidate is dropped off, and votes for that candidate are redistributed to those voters’ next choice.&nbsp; This process continues until one candidate receives a majority of the vote.</p><p>Not only does RCV solve ‘vote splitting’ and deliver a majority winner, but it<a href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/rcvbenefits\"> discourages negative campaigning</a>, because to be elected, candidates must often compete for second and third choice votes from supporters of their opponents — incentivizing candidates to find common ground with more voters.&nbsp;</p><p>For these reasons, Maine’s adoption of RCV is a major advance in U.S. politics.&nbsp; But it doesn’t go nearly far enough. RCV makes great sense to elect single-seat executive offices like mayor, governor and president. But electing our legislators via single-seat districts — when we could elect them by proportional representation — unnecessarily and greatly limits representation.&nbsp;</p><p>There are multiple and diverse public policy perspectives in our country. No one candidate or party can reflect them all — even when reaching out more broadly under single-seat RCV.&nbsp; Our legislatures (and our public policy) would be better informed by seating more of those perspectives at the table of our democracy — rather than by excluding many of them (and the voters who support them) before the legislative process even begins.&nbsp;</p><p>Maine’s RCV elections preserve the idea that it is healthy for democracy to place a wide range of world views before general election voters, views that are reflective of a broad range of society. It does this by retaining the ability of each ballot qualified party to choose its general election nominee via its party primary. Then in the general election, all of them compete under RCV.</p><p>Alaska’s newly adopted general election RCV does the opposite.<a href=\"https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/Attachment.aspx?id=124553\"> Measure Two</a>, which was just approved 50.5% to 49.5% by Alaska voters, eliminates the ability of diverse political parties to automatically place a nominee on the general election ballot. Instead, party primaries for state and federal office are replaced by a top four jungle primary (without RCV!), in which all candidates from all parties compete against each other for the right to advance to the general election, where they then compete against each other under RCV.</p><p>Just like with California’s top two system, there could be multiple Democrats and multiple Republicans in the primary all running against each other under Alaska’s top four. And just like with California’s top two, because RCV is not used in the primary, ‘vote-splitting’ and ‘lesser-of-evils’ remains in play. The only difference is that these dynamics are spread over sending four candidates to the general election, instead of two.</p><h2>Top-Four Duopoly</h2><p>Under California’s top two system, candidates from smaller ballot-qualified parties have never advanced to the general election for any state or federal office, when there are also at least two Democrats and/or Republicans on the primary ballot. A top four primary will likely see more Democrats and Republicans on the general election ballot, compared to California’s top two. But in most cases, it will still constrain general election voters to the limited policy approaches and ideological range offered by those parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Alaska, only once since 1996 have fewer than four Democrats and/or Republicans run in primary elections for statewide office (for Governor, US Senate or US House) — and that was with only two general election places on the ballot up for grabs. Under top four, the number of candidates from those larger parties will likely increase. As a result, even with four places on the general election ballot (compared to top two), candidates from smaller parties will rarely if ever advance to the general election. This is especially the case because RCV will not be used in those primaries, meaning supporters of smaller parties will still face either voting for the candidates they most favor in the primary election, or the lesser-of-evil major party candidate closest to their views.</p><p>The rare exceptions will likely be in a small number of state legislative races when there are fewer than four Democrats and/or Republicans running; and/or where so many of them run and ‘vote-split’, that a smaller party candidate is able to slip by. But why should you care, unless you are a supporter of one of the smaller parties? Because in practice, top two elections have replicated our polarizing, unrepresentative two-party duopoly, only in a slightly altered form - and it is highly unlikely a top four system will be much different.</p><h2>Misreading the Voters</h2><p>It is a logical step from Maine’s use of RCV — which guarantees a general election spot for the nominees of all ballot qualified parties — to multi-seat elections by proportional representation, which embodies the idea that supporters of those parties all deserve legislative representation</p><p>By eliminating a guaranteed spot on the general election ballot for all ballot-qualified parties, Alaska’s new RCV law moves away from promoting a viable multi-party democracy.&nbsp; Perhaps the biggest danger is its anti-party mentality that<a href=\"https://www.elections.alaska.gov/petitions/19AKBE/Eng_AKBE%20Supporting%20Statement.mp3\"> maintains that a jungle primary is preferable to party primaries</a>, ‘because all voters can choose who ends up on the general election ballot, instead of the members of each political party.’'</p><p>It’s very dangerous for our democracy to misread (or misrepresent) the frustration that comes from voters’ lack of choice under our current system — that comes from having only two competitive major parties that are not fully representative of the range of viewpoints in the electorate — and conclude that voters reject the idea of political parties per se.&nbsp;</p><p>This same anti-party mentality assumes the growing number of non-affiliated voters (who chose not to register as a party member in voter-registration-by-party-states) means these voters reject political parties per se, when the reality is that the electoral system does not render electorally viable parties that represent them.</p><p>By contrast, in countries that use elections by proportional representation, there are usually four, five or six parties in their state and federal legislatures; and far more voters are able to vote to elect someone who truly represents their views than under the U.S. system.&nbsp; In such systems each political party also has a more clear identity than the Democrats and the Republicans do in the U.S., which are often seen as political shells to be taken over — increasing cynicism that parties and politicians don’t really stand for anything — which then leads to arguments for eliminating party primaries and replacing them with top two/top four.&nbsp;</p><h2>Redistricting Problems</h2><p>Top two and top four systems also distract from real solutions to gerrymandering and redistricting.&nbsp; California<a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-a-gerrymandering-ban-cant-keep-politicians-from-trying-to-shape-their-districts/\"> tried to solve partisan gerrymandering</a> by adopting a Citizens Redistricting Commission — so politicians couldn’t chose their voters, and the state legislature couldn’t continue drawing legislative districts to protect incumbents.&nbsp;</p><p>But more competitive districts don’t mean more representative.

NBC 4 in New York reports that he “has the potential to immediately upend a race that was shaping up as a contest between long-entrenched city politicians.”<br></p><p>Yang is once again entering a crowded field of Democratic contenders. This time, however, it is for the top office in the nation’s largest city. A recent poll reportedly shows him with a slight lead in the race.<br></p><p>However, the timing of Yang’s entrance in the mayoral race is interesting for another reason: It comes as some within the Democratic establishment are attempting to suspend the use of or even kill ranked choice voting’s use in the election.<br></p><p>This is important to note because <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/new-york-voters-overwhelmingly-pass-ranked-choice-voting\">NYC voters overwhelmingly approved the use of ranked choice voting </a>(RCV) for municipal primary elections in November 2019. It wasn’t even a question what voters wanted either as the RCV referendum was approved with a near 3-to-1 margin.<br></p><p>Yet, on the eve of its first use, members of the Democratic establishment are scrambling in an effort to halt RCV’s introduction in NYC elections. The Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/12/democrats-election-ranked-choice-voting-new-york/617461/\">reports</a> that this effort includes “the majority leader of the New York City Council and the leaders of its Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus,” and is backed by mayoral candidate and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.<br></p><p>“Supporters of ranked-choice voting see the push to stall its implementation as a thinly disguised attempt by members of the Democratic establishment to thwart a reform that would threaten their grip on power by further opening up New York City’s machine politics to newcomers,” writes Russell Berman for The Atlantic.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“It’s particularly galling, they say, given that the city’s electorate endorsed the change so overwhelmingly a year ago. And supporters of ranked-choice voting say that by filing Hail Mary lawsuits and sowing confusion about how the election will be run, opponents of the system are resorting to ‘Trumpian tactics’ to delay, or deny, the will of New York voters.”<br></blockquote><p>How does Andrew Yang fit into this? He is a <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/yang-gang-joins-fight-for-ranked-choice-voting\">prominent supporter of ranked choice voting</a>, for one thing. Yang has spoken <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/andrew-yang-podcast-your-us-rep-doesnt-care-what-you-think-but-we-can-fix-that\">several times</a> now about the need for systemic reforms to US elections that foster competition by encouraging new people with fresh ideas to launch campaigns.<br></p><p>Based on coverage of his entry into the race, Yang is already considered a popular figure in NYC. He could prove to be a thorn in the Democratic establishment’s side if he adds to this popularity by defending the will of the people when those who traditionally hold the most power and influence over the process attempt to squash it.<br></p><p>Yang is not an establishment candidate. He brings new ideas to the table that challenge the political status quo and traditional partisan norms. He is the type of candidate who could do well in an RCV election, in which voters rank candidates in order of preference and a majority winner is ensured.<br></p><p>Without RCV, it is all but guaranteed that the winner of the Democratic contest in the mayoral race, in which many people have filed, will end with a winner who gets substantially less than majority support. With RCV, automatic rounds of runoff would be held based on voter preferences until a candidate surpassed 50% of the vote.<br></p><p>It’s easy to see why groups within the partisan establishment would object to giving voters a system that historically has given people greater confidence in the process. When those in power prefer a particular candidate, it is easier to get them elected when they don’t have to compete for as many votes as possible.<br></p><p>RCV in a crowded field of Democrats, the winner of which is likely to be the next mayor, means candidates have to campaign not just for voters’ first choices, but the second, third, even fourth choices of their rivals’ supporters. That gives voters greater voting power and say in the final results.<br></p><p>A state court recently <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/nyc-allowed-to-move-forward-with-its-first-ranked-choice-election\">rejected a lawsuit</a> brought by those who seek to halt RCV’s use in NYC. However, plaintiffs in the case plan to appeal, meaning the fight over the alternative voting method will continue. Yang’s presence will further amplify the effort to overturn the 2019 election, and the establishment’s argument that voters are too dumb to make informed decisions.<br></p><p>Yang also supports opening the primary process up to all voters. Currently, both the state and city of New York use closed primary elections, which in NYC denies voters access to taxpayer-funded elections that ultimately decide the city’s leadership.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I vastly prefer open primaries. I think having a diversity of perspectives is important,” Yang previously said. “And if you’re trying to win a general election you have to appeal to people that might not already be registered members of your party.”<br></p><p>Open primaries could drastically change the electoral landscape in a city like NYC, which already heavily favors Democratic candidates. Right now, most municipal elections are decided by members of a single political party, thus giving the partisan establishment a huge advantage and incredible control over who is elected.<br></p><p>Combined, both reforms would greatly loosen the grip the Democratic establishment has on NYC elections. Though open primaries are currently not in place, Yang’s influence on the campaign trail and potentially as mayor could help give voters outside the dominant party a greater say in who represents them while fostering an environment that encourages greater competition in local politics.<br></p><p>In other words, Andrew Yang could help end the political monopoly in NYC.<br></p>","name":"How Andrew Yang Could End the Political Monopoly in NYC","teaser":"Andrew Yang is about to drastically shake up the mayoral race in New York City, and it could be bad news for the Democratic establishment’s control over city elections.","slug":"how-andrew-yang-could-end-the-political-monopoly-in-nyc","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","topics-new":"5d0d36dca07cda96643a8d51","updated-on":"2020-12-26T17:38:38.026Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2020-12-24T00:53:47.877Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-12-26T17:38:41.806Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","hero":{"fileId":"5fe3e7afca1f276e50368b1c","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fe3e7afca1f276e50368b1c_andrew%20yang.jpg","alt":null},"hero-caption":"Photo Credit: Gage Skidmore","_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5fe3e69bd9de586cf1bea149"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"sticky":false,"publish-date":"2020-12-20T23:06:00.000Z","featured":true,"body":"<p>A <a href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/monopoly_politics_2020_the_root_of_dysfunction_in_the_u_s_the_the_u_s_house_of_representatives?e=703cb4cfd177700d8582913264567554&utm_source=fairvote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=monopoly_politics_20&n=1\">new report</a> from the nonpartisan group FairVote reinforces what it and other political reform advocates and experts have said for years: Partisanship is becoming the primary determinant of electoral outcomes in nearly every election.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://fairvote.com/\">FairVote</a> recently released its 2020 iteration of “<a href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/monopoly_politics_2020_the_root_of_dysfunction_in_the_u_s_the_the_u_s_house_of_representatives?e=703cb4cfd177700d8582913264567554&utm_source=fairvote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=monopoly_politics_20&n=1\">Monopoly Politics</a>,” a biennial project in which the group predicts the results of all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives before each major election cycle, and they do it with impressive accuracy.<br></p><p>According to the 2020 report, FairVote predicted “357 high confidence seats with a 99.7% accuracy rate, accounting for 82.1% of seats in the House of Representatives.” The group bases its predictions on prior voting patterns, not on polling results, a methodology that has worked since FairVote began the project in 1997.<br></p><p>It is worth noting that the predictions for November 2020 were made in November 2018, a startling reminder of how little competition there is in US elections and the consequence this has on the nation’s politics. The authors of “Monopoly Politics” say a key takeaway from their report is the increasing role partisanship is playing in the outcome of congressional elections. </p><p>FairVote uses a metric it calls the “incumbency bump” to gauge performance of incumbents and so-called “crossover candidates,” which are elected officials who represent a district that supported the presidential candidate of the opposite party in the previous presidential election.<br></p><p>In other words, it is widely assumed that there is an inherent advantage to being an incumbent. FairVote measures the strength of this advantage for Democrats and Republicans who were elected in areas that traditionally vote for the “other side.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>According to the report, this advantage is shrinking, which means all the things that used to give incumbents a leg up on the opposition (e.g. money, name recognition, experience, etc) does not mean as much as the partisan-leanings of local voters.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fdfd9ba9de7370bba19965c_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-20%20at%2011.52.26%20AM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>After the 2018 elections, there were 41 crossover representatives in Congress -- 38 Democrats and 3 Republicans. Twenty-nine of these representatives won reelection in 2020, resulting in a further decline in an incumbency bump that has gradually dropped to new lows since its peak in 2000.<br></p><p>“An increase in the predictability of partisanship at the expense of incumbency advantage, even for incumbents who maintained moderate voting records, means something troubling: the identity of candidates and their campaigns are mattering less and less,” FairVote’s report states.<br></p><p>Many people know the saying, “all politics is local.” Not only does this mean that politics is more consequential to a person’s daily life the closer it gets to home, but it used to also mean that local values and political issues shaped how voters selected candidates up and down the ballot.<br></p><p>To various extents, local values and issues still impact how voters cast their ballots. However, for several years now, the divide between the Republican and Democratic Parties at the national level has increasingly seeped into local politics and has thus affected partisan trends at a local level.&nbsp;<br></p><p>FairVote calls this phenomenon the “nationalization of politics.”<br></p><p>This is an important thing to note because it is another warning sign that as the divide between the parties worsens, so will the state of elections in the US. Candidates will entrench themselves further into divisive behavior to the detriment of the needs of the American people and the needs of the country. Further, candidates willing to work across the political aisle and hold more moderate views will become even rarer.<br></p><p>“If Americans feel as if they are split into red and blue camps more than ever, or that there’s no room for cross-partisan dialogue, there’s a very clear systemic reason for that,” said FairVote President and CEO Rob Richie.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“Our elections fundamentally reward partisanship. We will not be able to clear this hurdle and come together as a nation until we are able to enact the reforms, like the Fair Representation Act, that ensure Americans are more truly represented in the People’s House.”<br></blockquote><p>The Fair Representation Act would reform congressional elections to have multi-member districts, instead of the single-member, winner-takes-all districts that FairVote says exacerbate hyper-polarization. Each state would have fewer and larger congressional districts represented by 5-6 public officials elected in ranked choice voting elections.<br></p><p>“Multi-winner districts allow more voters to participate in meaningfully competitive elections, and the vast majority of voters of both parties would be able to help elect candidates from their districts who share their views,” FairVote states. “FairVote’s <a href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/fair_representation_act_report#read_fair_representation_act_report\">Fair Representation Act Report</a> estimates that this change would roughly triple the number of voters able to participate in competitive House elections.”<br></p><p>Looking ahead, FairVote is unable to publish predictions for the 2022 congressional elections until states redraw electoral districts in 2021. However, the group said it will be able to post projections for the 2024 election cycle immediately after the November 2022 elections.<br></p><h4><strong>Read the complete Monopoly Politics 2020 report </strong><a href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/monopoly_politics_2020_the_root_of_dysfunction_in_the_u_s_the_the_u_s_house_of_representatives?utm_campaign=monopoly_politics_20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=fairvote\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br></h4>","name":"New Report: The Greatest Advantage in US Elections Is Not Incumbency, It's Partisanship","teaser":"A new report from the nonpartisan group FairVote reinforces what it and other political reform advocates and experts have said for years: Partisanship is becoming the primary determinant of electoral outcomes in nearly every election.","slug":"new-report-the-greatest-advantage-in-us-elections-is-partisanship-not-incumbency","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","topics-new":"5d0d36dca07cda96643a8d51","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"updated-on":"2020-12-24T00:46:35.253Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2020-12-20T23:19:18.584Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-12-26T17:19:51.883Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","hero":{"fileId":"5fdfdd1468f6bd29290e4989","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fdfdd1468f6bd29290e4989_andy-feliciotti-8cvjI48SFtY-unsplash.jpg","alt":null},"_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5fdfdbf6e206adb9b3850b77"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"sticky":false,"publish-date":"2020-12-19T20:48:00.000Z","featured":true,"body":"<p>Editor's Note: This article originally appeared on The Fulcrum and has been republished on IVN&nbsp;with permission from the publisher. </p><p>‍</p><p>New York City can move forward with its debut of ranked elections in seven weeks, because a state judge has turned back arguments the system would effectively disenfranchise minority voters.<br></p><p>The nation's biggest city has become the most populous and prominent place in the nation to embrace <a href=\"https://thefulcrum.us/ranked-choice-voting\" target=\"_self\">ranked-choice voting</a>, an alternative election system hailed in the democracy reform world as a topflight way to combat polarization in governance.</p><p>Six members of the City Council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus and other community organizations sued this month to delay its implementation, arguing election officials do not have enough time to ready the switch and educate voters about the new system.

No matter what, my side is right and must win and the other side is wrong and must lose.<br></p><p>As a result, a <a href=\"https://texasscorecard.com/federal/video-wagons-suitcases-and-coolers-roll-into-detroit-voting-center-at-4-am/\">video</a> that showed people carrying coolers and suitcases into a Detroit voting center became incontrovertible evidence to some of something shady happening with the election results. And, simply the number of sworn affidavits filed was enough to confirm fraud -- not what the affidavits actually say.<br></p><p>On the other side, no incident that raised concern among voters was enough to cause pause. No need to look further into the matter because all it will do is feed into the ego of the president and the delusions of his supporters.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When we fail to take a step back and look at the election as objective observers, we fail to give concerns and grievances our full and thoughtful consideration.&nbsp;We ignore evidence or lack thereof when it doesn't suit us. We do not get a full and complete picture of the 2020 elections. </p><p>It is only about who won and who lost.<br></p><h2>Deep Systemic Problems: How The Two-Party Duopoly Has Hidden the Forest for the Trees</h2><p>In the eyes of the judicial system, there was not enough evidence of widespread fraud to support a legal argument that the election results were tampered with in key battleground states or anywhere else. This determination extends from state courts to the US Supreme Court. </p><p>As far as the administration of elections is concerned, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election\">called</a> the 2020 elections the most secure in modern US history.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This does not mean a voter’s lack of faith in or grievances with the process are not valid. It is important to note that the conversation on both sides -- with Republicans and Democrats -- focused on the administration of elections (e.g. vote by mail, voting machine tabulation, vote counting, etc.), rather than the electoral process itself.<br></p><p>Remember, many voters turned to Trump in 2016 because they were frustrated with the political status quo. These were voters who already lacked or had diminished faith in the political process at-large.&nbsp;<br></p><p>What Trump did effectively was tap into frustration and disenchantment that already existed. However, he, like the parties, narrowed the conversation to&nbsp; “us vs them” -- some might argue “me vs them” disguised as “us vs them.” If he didn’t win that meant the other side cheated.<br></p><p>Perpetuating a negative and divisive narrative like this is destructive, no matter what side starts it, and it can get out of hand quickly as we have seen in recent years and the 2020 election cycle. <strong>No matter how wronged we feel by the system or the \"other side,\" there is no excuse for violence or threats of violence.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>And, when we hold on to the divisive partisan mindset, we allow the forest to be hidden for the trees. We fail to see there is a bigger problem, not in the administration of elections, but with the electoral process at-large. We fail to truly analyze why we and others are disenchanted with the US&nbsp;political process; namely, we don't feel represented by it. </p><p>If someone voted for Trump, I&nbsp;encourage them to ask themselves if they believe anything truly changed with the political process in the last 4 years. If someone voted for Biden, I&nbsp;encourage them to consider whether they truly think anything will change in the political process under his leadership. If the genuine answer to both is \"no,\" the follow up question should be, why?</p><p>Elections are a zero-sum contest between two private political corporations because those corporations, the Republican and Democratic Parties, designed it to be that way. Elections are not about substance. They are not about long-term solutions. They are not really about voters. They are only about \"Team Red\" and \"Team Blue.\"<br></p><p>The message these teams send to people is: pick a side or stay out of the process. We see this from the very beginning of the electoral season, during the primaries, where voters are told -- and in a lot of cases forced -- to pick between the two sides and stay there.</p><p>And, the mainstream conversation, just like public officials, often ignores those the parties cast aside. We celebrate the record-breaking turnout of 2020 without considering that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why\">80 million eligible citizens didn’t vote</a>. The partisan narrative would have people believe this is a result of apathy but the truth is many of these voters have so little confidence in their voice being heard that their conclusion is, “Why bother?”&nbsp;</p><p>There is an important distinction between apathy and disenchantment.<br></p><p>How many candidates do you hear talk extensively about giving all eligible voters a process they can have confidence in? I know I am not the only one hearing cricket noises, because partisan candidates know they don’t really have to care what voters think. The system rewards loyalty to the two major parties (which control primaries, ballot access, the largest flow of money, access to voter data, the debates, etc), not loyalty to voters.<br></p><p>Broad systemic problems to a partisan-controlled system need a thoughtful, nonpartisan approach. By understanding the barriers that deny voters and candidates outside the major parties fair elections, meaningful participation, and accountability in the nation’s politics, we can better understand why so many people have lost faith in the electoral process.</p><p>Voters deserve to have faith in the US&nbsp;political system. They deserve elections that put their interests first. They deserve accountable representation. It is the only way we, as a nation, can move forward and come to long-term solutions to solve the problems facing the country. It is also the only way to end divisive and destructive zero-sum politics.<br></p>","name":"Voters Deserve to Have Faith in the Electoral Process","slug":"voters-deserve-to-have-faith-in-the-electoral-process","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"topics-new":"5d0d0dfb2be7835ae576a5cc","updated-on":"2020-12-17T23:13:41.964Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2020-12-17T19:53:35.627Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-12-17T23:13:44.851Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","hero":{"fileId":"5fdbcdab72d6e735fd4d0cc2","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fdbcdab72d6e735fd4d0cc2_voters.jpg","alt":null},"hero-caption":"Photo Source: AP","teaser":"The reality is millions of voters do not have faith in the electoral process.

Unfortunately, Pfizer doesn’t seem to have an antidote for the ills that plague the body politic.<br></p><p>Pardon my pessimism, but partisanship feels pricklier than ever. The presidency notwithstanding, the preeminent political players have primarily preserved power.<br></p><p>With that depressive thought in mind, here are 10 reasonably bipartisan political predictions that don’t bode well for our democracy. Whether they make you laugh, cry or curse aloud, here’s to a new year where we all take representative government more seriously.<br></p><h3><strong>Georgia On Our Minds</strong></h3><p>Due to state law, both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate races will be decided by a runoff election on Jan. 5. Republican Sen. David Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler is dueling with Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. These results will likely determine the balance of power in the Senate.<br></p><p><strong>I predict…&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>We’ll be seeing a lot of Loeffler and Warnock. Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson retired in late 2019 for health reasons. Loeffler is a gubernatorial appointee to the seat. Let’s say Loeffler, or Warnock, wins the runoff in a tight race. Then comes the runoff recount and an ensuing brouhaha. Upon resolution, it won’t be long before both are back on the campaign trail. The seat has a term that expires in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Too Much Information&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>President-elect Joe Biden has a habit of letting his personal stories run on a little too long. We didn’t need to know he’d just stepped out of the shower when he started to play with his dog Major which led to him slipping on a rug and fracturing a bone in his foot.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>White House aides will stand at the back of the press briefing room and signal him to curtail his home-spun tales. A good approach would be to hold up a sign with a photo of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris holding a finger up to her lips. Alternatively, they might use a photo of actress and comedian Maya Rudolph holding a movie clapper with the word “Cut!” on it.<strong>‍</strong></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fdb8c46cabffb6f693b59ae_Think.again.%20Jose.M..jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Photo by Jose M. on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Say My Name</strong><br></h3><p>Coronavirus is a deadly disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and more than 1.5 million people all over the world.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>People will stop calling the cause of the pandemic The ’Rona. When Donald Trump Jr. caught COVID-19 and made an Instagram video where he smilingly announced, “Apparently, I got The ’Rona.” According to late-night comedian Steven Colbert, “The Rona is something diagnosed by a Bro Doc.” Let’s take the name seriously. Would you want an ER physician singing you the Billy Joel lyric, “<em>Working too hard gave you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack</em>?”<br></p><h3><strong>Scarfing Them Up</strong></h3><p>Dr. Deborah Birx was the fashionable figurehead for the current administration as its coronavirus response coordinator. She wants to continue in the next administration in some capacity, but her reputation may have become bleach-stained.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>I predict…&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>As a backup side hustle, Dr. Birx will agree to do a one-night stint on the QVC shopping channel selling her trademark colorful scarves. If the Biden administration snubs her? Look for a merch collab with Beyoncé on a signature line of turquoise Hermès knockoffs, selling exclusively in K-Mart.<br></p><h3><strong>Fauci, Anthony Fauci</strong></h3><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci has advised six presidents on infectious diseases. The immunologist’s stock rose after Brad Pitt portrayed him on “Saturday Night Live.”</p><p><strong>I predict…</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>After being named Sexiest Man Alive by both “People” and AARP,” Dr Fauci will be signed to a three-picture deal as the next James Bond. How does he like his onscreen cocktails? Frozen, then injected.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fdb8c70717b6867a0329be4_what.now.Tim.Mossholder.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Photo by Tim Mossholde on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Mitch &amp; Nancy World</strong></h3><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seem to be in an unending loop of scripted inaction in Washington.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>It will be revealed that Mitch and Nancy were replaced by “Westworld”-style android hosts back in 2010. Both have been programmed by special-interest groups to let high-paying lobbyists have their way with the federal government. When the country hears about it, they’ll be up in arms for an entire news cycle, then forget all about it.<br></p><h3><strong>WAWAWEEWA!&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>“Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” proved once again that Sasha Baron Cohen is a master of disguise and a pro at punkin’ the political world. Where’s he been lately, though?<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>For “Moviefilm III,” he’s plotting to impersonate U.S. Rep-elect Sara Jacobs (D, CA-53). Why Jacobs? She’s new and not yet highly recognizable. Jacobs will be focused on climate change, social injustice and trying to be initiated into The Squad. Meanwhile, impersonator Sasha Baron Jacobs will wreak havoc in the halls of Congress, promoting polygamy, misogyny and pro-Kazakhstan legislation.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>It’ll Be Called ‘The Coif’</strong></h3><p>The Netflix historical drama “The Crown,” is out of source material and producers need subject matter for a new series. Though highly acclaimed, critics have said the retelling of Queen Elizabeth’s long reign in the British monarchy was highly dramatized and often skewered actual history.<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>The production team will focus on drama queen Trump for its next project. For a Trump Administration miniseries, historical accuracy <em>demands</em> obfuscation of historical accuracy. Recall: The Access Hollywood tape. The biggest-inauguration-crowd-ever claim. The revolving door at the White House. Kids in cages. A refusal to admit election defeat. You don’t need to make that stuff up. Alex Baldwin to star.<br></p><h3><strong>Pardon Me!</strong></h3><p>Rudy Giuliani has some free time now that his Quixotic national quest to invalidate the Presidential election has reached a dead end.<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>In early January, America’s Mayor will host a limited-series podcast called “Pardon Me!” The first episode will go toward explaining the Constitutionality of a pre-emptive Presidential pardon. Guests will include Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump. Jared Kushner’s podcast appearance will be preempted when the sound of his voice makes dogs all over the country howl in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Let’s Vote On It</strong></h3><p>An enormous amount of time and energy went into complaints about the legitimacy and accuracy of the 2020 election process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>I predict…</strong><br></p><p>We’ll spend a couple years forgetting and/or ignoring the country needs clarity on mail-in voting and ballot tabulation and the Electoral College. There’ll be a minimum of concern that arises before the 2022 midterm elections. By October 2024, news pundits will once again be talking about rigged election plots by billionaire George Soros and deceased Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.<br></p>","name":"10 Political Predictions for 2021: A Never-Ending Georgia Campaign, TMI from Joe Biden & Borat in Congress?","teaser":"OPINION: Here are 10 reasonably bipartisan political predictions that don’t bode well for our democracy.","hero-caption":"Graphic by JC Polk","hero":{"fileId":"5fdb8b9718a822c206dadd3d","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5fdb8b9718a822c206dadd3d_2021prediction_image.jpg","alt":null},"slug":"10-political-predictions-for-2021-a-never-ending-georgia-campaign-tmi-from-joe-biden-borat-in-congress","topics-new":"5f21b761135dbc61fe380dfe","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","franchise-2":["5f21ad4701525b5a7e98cae8","5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"author-s":["5f52743d2e2bd910b329ed23"],"updated-on":"2021-02-02T19:13:42.577Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2020-12-17T16:51:58.676Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5f2881eed6d8557885fdd412","published-on":"2021-02-02T19:13:42.577Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5fdb8cae64cce378d8aea89e"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"sticky":false,"publish-date":"2020-12-17T16:36:00.000Z","featured":true,"body":"<p><strong><em>This is an independent opinion.

Email it to sandiego@ivn.us</em></strong></p><p>Bernie Sanders’ loss of the Democratic Party’s nomination for president prompted some voters to cry out, as they have in the past, for the creation of a new party. There is merit to this idea, given that repeated attempts to fashion the Democratic Party into a force for progressive change have failed.</p><p>While a party that reflects progressive values would warm my heart, now is not the time to add another source of partisan divisiveness in the form of a political party. In fact, to create a new party of any kind at this moment would be to disregard the tenor of the times as it would likely increase divisiveness. More parties might <em>decrease </em>divisiveness if our political system didn’t punish those who hold opinions outside the two mainstream parties.</p><p>All across the U.S., citizens have been trending away from narrow partisanship and toward reduced polarization. The 44% of registered voters who look at their choices and respond “neither,” far outstrips the number of people registered to either of the two major parties.</p><p>In addition, recent electoral reform measures like open primaries and top-four ranked choice voting force candidates to address a broader base of voters than just those of one party. Add to these reforms citizen commissions that take control of redistricting out of the hands of partisan politicians, and you see that a grassroots movement toward less partisanship and polarization is on the rise in America.</p><p>Voters of every hue and stripe would do well to note these broad political trends. Rather than introduce another party into the partisan mire, disillusioned Republicans, Democrats and Independents should join in efforts to empower voters over political parties and special interests.</p><p>For example, frustrated voters can advocate for a number of initiatives that would improve our democracy:</p><ul><li>Join efforts to implement <a href=\"https://representsandiego.org/ranked-choice-voting/\">top-four (or five) ranked-choice voting</a> at the state and local levels.</li><li><a href=\"https://representsandiego.org/signup-form\">Initiate and support efforts</a> to create citizen redistricting commissions to end partisan gerrymandering.</li><li>Fight for <a href=\"https://representsandiego.org/democracy-dollars\">public campaign financing and transparency</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://represent.us/actions/\">Support other reform initiatives</a> such as term limits, open primaries and absentee voting.</li></ul><p>The time to win elections based on ideological purity is on the wane, and the time for reforming our democracy to reflect the will of the people is upon us.</p><p>The Represent San Diego community invites civic-minded San Diegans from the Left, Right and Center to come together to fight for a democracy that works.

But the coronavirus pandemic is “likely stripping away many of these gains,” researchers at the Public Policy Institute of California found in a <a href=\"https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/incoming-inequality-and-economic-opportunity-in-california-december-2020.pdf\">new report</a>.</p><p>The current coronavirus-induced recession has hit low-income workers the hardest, while higher income workers, largely able to work from home, have escaped relatively unscathed. And those acute job losses among low-wage workers — particularly African Americans, Latinos, workers without college degrees and women — have stayed worryingly high through the fall, the researchers found. </p><p>This could be “exacerbating that kind of pattern of recession and recovery that’s worse for low-income families,” said lead author Sarah Bohn, who is the vice president of research at PPIC. “In fact, these unemployment rate differences across income are a bit worse today than they were during the Great Recession.”</p><p>The findings were underscored by troubling new estimates of monthly poverty rates in the Golden State, from a group of researchers led by Zachary Parolin at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy.</p><p>“The monthly poverty rate in October was actually higher than rates during April and May, despite the fact that the unemployment rate declined over that time,” said Parolin at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpEDmPgDy34&t=1353s\">live-streamed data release</a>. That’s because the federal CARES Act stimulus checks and expansion of unemployment benefits have mostly expired. With <a href=\"https://cbrtcfj.createsend1.com/t/ViewEmail/j/EBA4E15BEBE2FE412540EF23F30FEDED\">unemployment ticking up</a> as California’s new regional shut down orders go into effect, the picture is likely worse now.</p><p>Parolin’s <a href=\"https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2020/covid-projecting-monthly-poverty\">estimates</a> replicate the Census Bureau’s annual Supplemental Poverty Measure, which accounts for safety net benefits and the cost of living, unlike the Official Poverty Measure. It’s a measure that <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article234920662.html\">California consistently tops</a>.</p><p>Taken together, the two sets of research painted an alarming picture of deepening poverty and inequality that could take years if not decades for California to dig itself out of.</p><p>California lawmakers are already mulling solutions, though ambitious proposals made now often get reigned in by fiscal realities later in the spring.</p><p>Last week, Assemblymember Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the budget committee, announced <a href=\"https://a19.asmdc.org/sites/a19.asmdc.org/files/pdf/2021-22-assembly-budget-blueprint.pdf\">his priorities</a> for the session. They included transitional kindergarten for all 4-year-olds, more financial aid for college students, more money for low-income families through the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, and making parents who don’t work eligible for the state’s Young Child Tax Credit of up to $1,000.</p><p>“Our major priority is making sure we do everything to get money into the pockets of the most vulnerable Californians,” Ting said. “So many Californians are struggling. They’re on the brink of homelessness.”</p><p>Toni Symonds, chief consultant for the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economic Development, and the Economy, speaking on a panel about the new poverty data said that lawmakers are considering expanding subsidized childcare for essential workers, salary subsidies for part-time workers at businesses reopening after regional shutdowns, and food assistance, such as the $365 the state gave to families with children last spring.</p><p>Matt Fleming, spokesperson for the Assembly Republican Caucus, said that Republican lawmakers, too, are focused on getting money into people’s pockets as quickly as possibly. They are considering bills to repeal AB 5, redirect funding for California’s floundering high-speed rail to education and fix the state’s beleaguered Employment Development Department. Above all, he said, they’ll advocate to keep businesses open and schools in-person as much as possible in the coming months.</p><p>“Governor Newsom’s COVID shutdowns have disproportionately targeted those industries that provide jobs to low-income families,” said Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove of Bakersfield in a statement. “Democrat policies have left them with fewer jobs, more unpaid bills, and less opportunity for their children.”</p><h3><strong>A recent history of economic inequality</strong></h3><p>The gap between California’s haves and have-nots has yawned open since 1980, with the loss of manufacturing jobs, more automation, rising incomes for highly educated workers, declining collective bargaining power, and rising numbers of less-educated immigrants, the PPIC researchers wrote.</p><p>In 1980, wages for the 10% of families with the highest incomes was 7.4 times larger than families in the bottom 10%. By 2019, that ratio was 9.8.</p><p>Recessions have historically made inequality worse. </p><p>The highest-income families generally take a hit of up to 7% then recover within a few years. Meanwhile, the lowest income families often face “much steeper and deeper declines” of up to 20% in wages, PPIC’s Bohn explained. In three of the last four recessions, it has taken them a decade on average to recover their pre-recession wages. </p><p>But following the recovery from the Great Recession, things were looking up. A historically long period of economic growth had seen incomes for the poorest Californians rise from $20,000 in 2014 to $27,000 in 2019, a 34% increase that outpaced income growth for the highest earners.</p><p>Then the pandemic hit, putting entire low-wage sectors out of work, like restaurants, retail, entertainment, tourism, beauty and barber shops. In the spring, as many as 44% of workers in families with incomes below $30,000 were either unemployed, working part time though they prefered to work full time, or had stopped looking for jobs, according to the report. By the fall, the number hadn’t dropped much, at about 37%.</p><h3><strong>Are solutions on the horizon? </strong></h3><p>The billions of dollars that the CARES Act pumped into California lifted an estimated 3.5 million Californians out of poverty in April, Columbia’s Parolin said. But that number dropped to 600,000 in October as unemployment benefits dried up. </p><p>Another <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2020/11/californians-pandemic-aid-ends-unemployment-eviction/?\">750,000 Californians</a> stand to lose unemployment benefits on Dec. 26, so if Congress doesn’t agree on a new stimulus package soon, California will see rising poverty rates in January, Parolin said.</p><p>Whether California’s short-term poverty rates stay high will largely depend on how Congress and the incoming Biden administration negotiate future stimulus packages.</p><p>Parolin said the federal government could quickly reduce monthly poverty by increasing the maximum benefit for food stamps by at least 15%, which it did during the Great Recession.</p><p>“What is clear to me is we need another round of stimulus last month and the month before, if not right now,” said Amy Everitt, president of Golden State Opportunity, a non-profit that has advocated for expanding the state’s earned income tax credit.</p><p>Bohn emphasized that the state has policy options, too, and Californians are hungry to fight inequality. In a September survey, PPIC found that 59% thought the state should do more to reduce the gap between rich and poor. The idea was especially popular among African Americans, Asian Americans and Latino residents. </p><p>The PPIC report included a list of short-term state policy suggestions: targeting relief to hard-hit businesses, expanding safety net benefits including to undocumented workers, investing in job training for workers in sectors like leisure and hospitality that may not recover, expand subsidies for child care.</p><p>Bohn warned that “over the long term, getting jobs back is not sufficient for improving the score of inequality.” The report recommended that the state improve long-term economic mobility by investing in access to high-quality child care and higher education and taking “corrective policy actions” to reverse long standing underinvestment in low-income and communities of color.</p><p>Riverside County Supervisor V. Manuel Perez said more funding for childcare was “essential” to getting families out of poverty, as is improving broadband access, which he called an “issue of civil rights” for children of color.</p><p>His largely Latino district, which encompasses the Coachella and Palo Verde Valleys, is a microcosm of California’s persistent inequality, he said, even though “there’s a picture out there that the Coachella Valley is a playground.”</p><p>“Quite frankly, it is for those that have, and it’s not for those that don’t,” Perez said.</p><p><em>This story has been updated to correct the percentage by which Zachary Parolin recommends Congress increase the maximum benefit amount of food stamps.</em></p><p><em>This article is part of the </em><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/projects/california-divide/?\"><em>California Divide,</em></a><em> a collaboration among newsrooms examining income inequality and economic survival in California.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/\"><em>CalMatters.org</em></a><em> is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.</em></p>","name":"Coronavirus Wipes Away Recent Wage Gains for Many California Workers, Report Finds","teaser":"New research finds the pandemic has likely stripped away most of the wage gains made after the Great Recession by California’s lowest earners.

The commission’s prime focus will almost certainly be the Supreme Court, which to Democrats is about as out of whack as it can get.<br></p><p>The commission will have no shortage of reform proposals from which to choose, from expanding the number of justices to requiring super majorities for certain cases to term limits. Although some also have suggested limiting jurisdiction, the most effective reform, the one that makes the most sense and is most in keeping with the Founders’ intentions, has rarely been mentioned: limiting judicial review, the power by which the Court can void a law that it decides is unconstitutional.<br></p><p>Judicial review does not appear in the Constitution. As former Justice Antonin Scalia admitted, “The Constitution of the United States nowhere says that the Supreme Court shall be the last word on what the Constitution means…We made it up.” But he added, “We made it up very sensibly, because what we said was, ‘Look, a Constitution is a law, it’s a sort of super-law…and what the law means is the job of the courts.’”<br></p><p>To buttress his argument that constitutional oversight is an obvious and universally accepted facet of the Supreme Court’s role, Justice Scalia cited Chief Justice John Marshall’s seminal opinion in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison. Marbury, the lead case in virtually every Constitutional Law textbook, not only established judicial review but also drastically altered the separation of powers that had emerged from the Constitutional Convention sixteen years before.<br></p><p>Ironically, Marbury stemmed from a court-packing scheme hatched by John Adams and Marshall himself, then Adams’s secretary of state. In the final days of his presidency, Adams appointed a slew of new federal judges and justices of the peace, one of whom was a minor functionary named William Marbury. (Adams also appointed Marshall as chief justice.) Although most of these commissions were “signed, sealed, and delivered” before the changeover in administrations, a number, including Marbury’s, were not.<br></p><p>James Madison was incoming president’s Thomas Jefferson’s Secretary of State. Madison found the commissions, signed and sealed, on his desk when he assumed the office. He refused to give them up and Marbury sued. To compel Madison to deliver his commission, Marbury asked the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus, using Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court that power.<br></p><p>Marshall was in a bind. If he ruled for his fellow Federalist Marbury, Jefferson would simply ignore him. If he ruled for Jefferson, he abdicated his and the Court’s power.<br></p><p>With inspired misdirection, Marshall ruled that Madison and Jefferson were indeed required to deliver Marbury’s commission. Alas, Marbury had chosen to ask the Supreme Court directly for the writ, whereas Article III, which stated, “In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,” restricted mandamus to appellate jurisdiction. Section 13, therefore, conflicted with the Constitution and must be struck down. Poor Marbury would not get his commission after all.&nbsp; Although Marshall’s opinion ran to ten thousand words, he conveniently left off the end of that sentence in Article III, which read, “with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.”&nbsp; As such, it seemed Section 13 was constitutional after all.<br></p><p>Now Jefferson was in a bind. If he did nothing, he tacitly granted power to the Federalist Supreme Court to oversee the constitutionality of legislative acts. The only way to avoid setting such a precedent was to deliver commissions to Marbury and the others and thereby undermine his authority throughout the Union.<br></p><p>Jefferson chose to continue to refuse the commissions and the right to interpret the law, to say “what the Constitution means,” passed from the legislature to the judiciary. Although the Supreme Court would not again strike down a federal statute for another fifty-four years, in another inflammatory case—Dred Scott v. Sandford—the power of constitutional oversight is now the Supreme Court’s most potent weapon.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If Marbury was a political decision, then, incorrectly decided, judicial review goes along with it.&nbsp; As does textualism. Scalia’s protests notwithstanding, it becomes not a philosophy on how to view the law, but rather a rationalization that allows its proponents to grab for political power.</p><p>Unless, of course, as many constitutional scholars contend, judicial review was implicit in the Constitution all along, and Marshall was merely giving body to that view. A number of the delegates, proponents insist, made statements in the convention that favored judicial review or considered it understood in the judicial function. In addition, various state provisions, especially in Virginia and Massachusetts, seem to indicate that judicial review, as an enunciation of separation of powers, was already an integral part of state government and could therefore logically be expected to be extended to any national system.<br></p><p>Neither of these assertions survive scrutiny. Although the Virginia Declaration of Rights, in Article V, seemed to give the courts a role in maintaining separation of powers, Article VII states, “All power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.” The Massachusetts constitution also clearly noted, “The power of suspending the laws, or the execution of the laws, ought never to be exercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived from it, to be exercised in such particular cases only as the legislature shall expressly provide for.”<br></p><p>At the convention, while judicial oversight was mentioned by a number of delegates in the course of the debates,” judicial review” in the modern sense was never discussed at all. The power of the judiciary to overturn an act of the legislature was raised almost exclusively with regard to participation in a “council of revision,” in which the Supreme Court, with the president, would essentially sign off on every congressional act. But granting the Court a limited veto power over Congress is not at all the same thing as ceding it final authority to “say what the Constitution means.” Vetoes can, after all, be overridden by the same body that passed the law, whereas once declared unconstitutional, a law can only be reinstated by amendment.<br></p><p>In fact, the notion of one branch being able to frustrate the other two was clearly anathema to many of the delegates.&nbsp; Roger Sherman, echoing Elbridge Gerry and Benjamin Franklin, noted that he was “agst. enabling any one man to stop the will of the whole.”&nbsp; Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts noted that “all agree that a check on the Legislature is necessary,” but he was firmly against “admitting the Judges to share in it.”<br></p><p>With no evidence to demonstrate that the delegates in Philadelphia considered judicial review an obvious and accepted power of the Supreme Court, it is impossible to extrapolate such an awesome and virtually unchecked power from Article III. If anything, the evidence that judicial review was specifically omitted from Article III has more weight. As Leonard Levy put it, “the Framers did not mean for the Supreme Court to have the authority to void acts of Congress.”<br></p><p>Some of history’s most respected legal theorists agree. William Blackstone, the patron saint of conservative justices everywhere wrote: </p><blockquote>“If parliament will positively enact an unreasonable thing, there is no power in the ordinary forms of the constitution vested with authority to control it. The judges are not at liberty to reject it, for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive to all government.” Montesquieu also rejected both judicial review and an active judiciary. “National judges are no more than the mouth that pronounces the words of the law, mere passive beings, incapable of moderating either its force or rigor.”</blockquote><p>There is no doubt that neither Marshall’s dubious reasoning, nor the absence of support at the Constitutional Convention, nor lack of ballast from legal philosophers will deter justices, especially conservative justices, from maintaining a vice grip on constitutional oversight. If that goes, the power to issue rulings such as <em>Citizens United</em> and <em>Shelby County v Holder</em> goes along with it.</p><p>Returning, however, to the phrase “with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make,” that Marshall omitted, it becomes clear that Congress and the president can loosen that grip.</p><p>If the Court loses the right to void laws, some would point out, what about equal rights cases, such <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> or <em>Roe v. Wade</em>?&nbsp; But those are cases in which states violated rights guaranteed in the federal constitution, the “supreme law of the land.” That is altogether different than making the Supreme Court superior to the other two branches of the federal government, and reform legislation can easily be drafted to make that distinction clear.</p><p>Denying the Court the ability to overturn an obnoxious federal law is not a perfect fix. There isn’t one. This is a question of balance, not absolutes. But where is it best to place final authority—with people who are accountable to voters every two, four, or six years, or with lifetime appointees accountable to no one?<br></p>","name":"OPINION: Forget Court Packing; We Need to Talk About Limiting Judicial Review","slug":"opinion-forget-court-packing-we-need-to-talk-about-limiting-judicial-review","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"topics-new":"5d0d0dfb2be7835ae576a5cc","author-s":["5eed164bf05b670416431da0"],"updated-on":"2020-10-28T16:07:34.686Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","created-on":"2020-10-28T15:58:27.063Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-10-30T12:25:42.445Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5f2881eed6d8557885fdd412","featured":true,"sticky":false,"hero":{"fileId":"5f9997049b406369af8e2c91","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5f9997049b406369af8e2c91_ian-hutchinson-U8WfiRpsQ7Y-unsplash.jpg","alt":null},"hero-caption":"Photo by Ian Hutchinson on Unsplash","teaser":"Judicial review does not appear in the Constitution.

The ballot measure of 1998 failed to address the same disparity for San Diego Unified elections and left a city-wide election process in place for San Diego Unified elections since.</p><p>In 2002, the California Voting Rights Act became law, making it easier for minority groups to prove their votes are diluted in at-large or city-wide elections.&nbsp; According to a recent update from the <a href=\"https://www.ndcresearch.com/\">National Demographics Corporation</a>, 400 municipalities have amended their charters to comply with the California Voting Rights Act since 2002. But, San Diego is not on the list.</p><p>San Diego Unified is the second-largest school district in California behind Los Angeles Unified. Yet, San Diego Unified holds the lone position as the only large school district that fails to comply with district-only elections.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's look into what has recently happened without district-only elections.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, education reformer LaShae Collins, a staffer of former Unified Trustee and California Assemblywoman Dr. Shirley Weber, ran for the open seat for Unified sub-district E against Whitehurst-Payne.&nbsp;</p><p>With overwhelming sub-district E support, <a href=\"https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2016/06/07/lashae-collins-wins-in-san-diego-school-board-primary/\">Collins handily won in the primary</a>, which is a district-only race. However, in the general election, where candidates then must compete in a citywide race, <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/nov/08/two-san-diego-school-board-seats-are-grabs-tuesday/\">Whitehurst-Payne edged out Collins</a>. Whitehurst-Payne was able to run a successful citywide campaign thanks to generous statewide financial support. In the general election, voters from La Jolla, Scripps Ranch, and Point Loma weighed in and reversed District E voter sentiment. By contrast, Collins grassroots financial support could not compete in the citywide race, being grossly outspent by Whitehurst-Payne’s overwhelming financial support.&nbsp;</p><p>Community complaints resulted in the San Diego County Jury convening on the matter of district-only elections. The <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/may/09/sd-sdusd-report/\">Grand Jury reported their findings</a> in a May 2017 report titled, \"San Diego Unified School Board Elections, Time for a Change.\"</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/lets-protect-our-right-to-elect-the-school-board-vote-no-on-measure-c\"><strong>Let’s Protect Our Right to Elect the School Board</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/the-ultimate-balancing-act-san-diego-teachers-pull-double-duty\"><strong>San Diego Teachers Pull Double Duty </strong></a></p><p>Recognizing the problem, the Grand Jury recommended that the City Council advance a ballot measure to address the district-only matter and also to send a future proposal to address term limits for school board trustees.&nbsp;</p><p>In what was argued as a delay tactic, the Rules Committee, then chaired by former Democratic Council President Myrtle Cole, sent the matter down to San Diego Unified, which has no jurisdiction over charter amendments, to survey parents of each of the five sub-districts for opinion. An Election Committee, formed by Trustees Whitehurst-Payne and Richard Barerra, was co-chaired by public policy groups based in the Bay Area.</p><p>Despite undeniable and overwhelming results that supported district-only elections and a maximum of two four-year term limits for trustees, the Committee instead recommended three four-year terms as the limit and ignored the district-only matter. Thus district-only elections, the very heart of the Grand Jury's findings, were again denied placement on the ballot as early as June 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>San Diego Unified's board approved the Committee recommendation for term limits of no more than three four-year terms for school board trustees. The Rules Committee agreed, and voters approved <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/San_Diego,_California,_Measure_H,_Term_Limits_for_School_Board_Members_(November_2018)\">Measure H in 2018</a>.&nbsp;Had Measure H been included the district-only matter two years ago, there would be no need for Measure C, and the three school board races in November may have different outcomes. And while that is speculative, the Grand Jury report of 2017 was crystal clear that candidates elected by the constituents they seek to represent would change the amount of money and influence required to compete in a citywide contest while employing an election process that complies with the CVRA.&nbsp;</p><p>With mounting frustration over distance learning, financial accountability, student and teacher safety, voters should carefully consider whether politics and special interests that have favored the status quo is ready for change.&nbsp;</p><p>What is certain is that the majority of students in California's second largest school district are people of color. And of that group, nearly half of all African American, Latino, and Pacific Islanders continue to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-26/latino-students-advance-only-to-fail\">fail to meet</a> state testing standards in English language arts and math, according to the California Department of Education.</p><p>Both major political parties in San Diego have endorsed Measure C. Passage of Measure C will amend the city charter and result in district-only contests for San Diego Unified. That it has taken years for voters to cast their vote is of little surprise given the nature of San Diego politics. That it took 32 years, and multiple opportunities to address is unconscionable.&nbsp;</p><p>The fiscal impact on the city of San Diego could result in wasted taxpayer dollars defending the indefensible. With municipalities voluntarily moving to district representation in light of CVRA and legal challenges, San Diego will likely feel the financial impact if a legal challenge succeeds in court this January. Since the city refused to deal with the matter in time to address another election in 2018, the outcome of the November 2020 elections could also be challenged if the city loses the court challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy lies in the state of public education in California that has been ineffective at bridging the achievement and opportunity gaps that plague our communities of color. Whether you see the problem as systemic racism or inefficient bureaucracy depends on whether you agree with the Grand Jury and countless parents, teachers, students, and community leaders that believe change is long overdue. For the sake of our kids, let’s hope politics takes a back seat to fix what qualifies as a civil rights issue of our time.</p><div></div><p><br></p>","name":"Measure C Will Correct a Decades-Long Battle for Voter Rights in San Diego Schools","teaser":"Public education is failing communities of color.

This means that people may only vote in a party’s primary election if they are registered members of that party prior to election day. If RCV passes, registered Democrats will rank Democratic candidates and registered Republicans will rank Republican candidates. Primary elections often see significantly lower turnout but are a crucial part of the election as they determine which final candidates will move on to the general election.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While New York City’s measure for Top-5 Ranked Choice Voting has some capabilities for producing more independent-minded party candidates, the measure fails to open up competition to third parties and independents. <strong><em>There is nothing written in the measure</em></strong> for ranking all candidates regardless of party affiliation or for those who do not want to be registered with a party. In the end, this means that nonpartisan voters have absolutely no say in which candidates advance to the general election.<br></p><p>Some reform advocates argue that despite the city’s closed primary, using Ranked Choice Voting even if just for the closed primary, helps move the needle in the right direction. Mainstream news organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/nyregion/ranked-choice-voting-ny.html\">New York Times</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/26/new-york-city-ranked-choice-voting-how-it-works\">Guardian</a> have been reporting on the story with nuanced opinions that further elevate the conversation and bring up the question of extending RCV into the presidential primaries and general election as Maine has recently done.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Other reform advocates may argue that RCV in a closed primary system does little to increase political competition outside of the two parties, where it is needed most. Candidates of the two major parties will still be campaigning to their general bases, with the comforting thought that at the end of a long day at the polls, it will still be registered party members deciding their fates.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It does raise the question: Will RCV really make a significant difference in how New York City politicians campaign if they still only have to appeal to voters of just their particular party?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p><br></p>","name":"Ranked Choice Voting For New York City?

Over one hundred guests attended the event established 19 years ago to shine a spotlight on leaders in civic and political life who challenge the status quo and fight for systemic change. This year’s event honored <strong>Jane Kleeb</strong>, <strong>Katie Fahey</strong> and <strong>Adrian Fontes</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The evening’s hosts included: Jenn Bullock, founder of Independent Pennsylvanians; Steve Hough, director of Florida Fair and Open Primaries; Dr. Jessie Fields, national board member of Independent Voting (IV); and Cathy Stewart, IV’s VP for National Development, opening the program with a welcome and acknowledgements of notable guests, among them: <strong>Michael Hardy</strong>, the Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the National Action Network; <strong>Lois Holzman</strong>, the Director of the East Side Institute; <strong>Jim Jonas</strong>, the Executive Director of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers; <strong>Harry Kresky</strong>, the General Counsel for Independent Voting; <strong>Reverend Gregory Seal Livingston</strong>, the President of the Coalition for a New Chicago; and <strong>John Opdycke</strong>, the President of Open Primaries.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"A person standing in front of a brick wallDescription automatically generated\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5dc04ddbb8d2c7d411078af8_Kq_E4py18uweIgctho1jJKyViZLdGxjvV-8VuDbjmHwRCEh3nDQwXQE8vXOFgit39dYgRBM2vg2X024nyxGiooDW9vrM2oGll41fvSaKzp9UBFmgHQRmJV0a2MAQXhwNNiO0UpTA5abEMQjv2w.jpeg\"></div></figure><p><strong>Dr. Lenora Fulani</strong>, honored at last year’s ceremony on the 30th anniversary of her history-making independent presidential campaign, delivered an update on the fight to protect NYC's public housing from privatization. </p><p>“When I ran for president as an independent 30 years ago,” said Fulani. “I was honored to become the first woman and first African American to get on the ballot of all 50 states and honored that my campaign initiated many important legal fights along the way. But what I was most honored to do was to fight on behalf of ordinary Americans who didn’t have a voice and who have been left out of the process and abandoned.” The attack on NYC public housing means that hundreds of thousands of families are living under the threat of displacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The hosts—all of them cabinet members of Independent Voting’s “Eyes on 2020” campaign—gave spirited reports on the body’s recent accomplishments. In January the cabinet began to raise a simple but historic voting rights question: <em>Will independents be given the same voting rights as all other voters in the 2020 presidential campaign?</em> Three years ago, in 2016, 26 million independents were locked out of the presidential primaries.&nbsp; In 2020, that number could be as high as 30 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>Could the Democratic and Republican parties simply decide to open up the presidential primaries to indies in 2020?” asked Dr. Fields.&nbsp;“Yes, they could. They have the power to make that change. &nbsp;Will they?&nbsp;That is the question that the Eyes on 2020 campaign has been asking across the country.” The hosts reported on highlights interspersed with media clips starting off with Florida where 3.6 million independents – 27% of the electorate - reside.</p><h3><strong>FLORIDA</strong>&nbsp; </h3><p>Voters in Florida have been demonstrating a strong desire for reform. In 2018, they passed an initiative to secure the automatic restoration of voting rights for people formerly incarcerated as felons with 65 percent of the vote.&nbsp;Also, independents came out from all <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BcY3IHRY8TA\">across the state - as shown in this media clip - to tell the Florida Constitution Revision Commission</a> they wanted the right to vote in party primaries.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img alt=\"A person in a suit and tieDescription automatically generated\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5dc04ddc1003108e9e4f4d04_-PncGfBTB-EUEyETjV46dtxamo1pvV4xx_EicnBpeVxnaLArOjYbKkD7vLrSzIeQuGSlWnN0ec-NmMMsvtp79anRivHQv_R3qM7OK-wRS5t637IIar-kMiC4oa5E9KZzA3vdgKSV68CNbPo1zg.jpeg\"></div></figure><p><em>Steve Hough: Founder, Florida Fair and Open Primaries</em></p><p>Though the Florida Constitution Revision Commission disagreed, Steve Hough’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FloridaFairAndOpenPrimaries/\">grassroots organization</a> set out to gather the 766,000 signatures on an initiative petition for nonpartisan elections—a tall order for a grassroots committee with no funding.&nbsp;With the support and guidance from Open Primaries, a Florida billionaire eventually stepped up to the plate and took up the cause that Steve’s group had given birth to. To date, they’ve collected over one million signatures to put a measure for nonpartisan Top Two state primaries on the ballot for November 2020.&nbsp;Not surprisingly in the last several weeks, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party of Florida both asked the court to throw the measure off the ballot.</p><p>On the 2020 presidential primary front, Hough reported on how deeply the partisan resistance to the rights of independents runs. After several Democratic leaders succeeded in getting four county Democratic Party Executive Committees to adopt a resolution to open the Florida Democratic Party primaries, including the presidential, the state party leaders took the resolution behind closed doors, rewrote it to be about registration, not voting rights, then further buried it as one phrase in an omnibus resolution that also condemned top two nonpartisan elections. The fight goes on, as Steve explained, He saluted the leaders inside the Democratic party who stood up and spoke out for a fair process.&nbsp;One of those, Dr. Jeffrey Solomon who spearheaded the effort to pass an open primary resolution in the Florida DP, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article235394182.html\">resigned from the Party and became an independent</a>. <br><br>The program turned to Arizona where 33% of all voters and forty-one percent of Latinos are independents.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img alt=\"Two people standing in front of a brick wallDescription automatically generated\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5dc04ddcd92683278ce1a024_aN-Lw-Qcgfn1AfcIgVyYm_zbijceVUSR5PgxHUPpvuS1-2454gxhFFaXuBy63g_t0AV3tpg9-SiWVnNc2ORtxcJxNUcdbdvOvB9hoA-D2r3a4WwRqhuppeJe_wkLQwa91X_XCFhAukecLBWaig.jpeg\"></div></figure><p><em>Cathy Stewart, VP for National Development, Independent Voting</em></p><h3><strong>ARIZONA</strong>&nbsp; </h3><p>Independent Voting has been in the trenches for the last decade in Arizona, pushing the political power of independent voters.&nbsp;In 2017<em>,</em> Independent Voting persuaded the Morrison Institute at Arizona State University to do a research study on the cultural impact of independent voters, the subject of a local <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BWMplx44p3I\">PBS<em> </em>show <em>Arizona Horizon</em> segment with Independent Voting President Jackie Salit and then Morrison Institute Director Thom Reilly. </a>&nbsp;</p><p>In Arizona, there are open primaries for every single election except for one, the presidential primary, where independents are barred. (The Republican Party cancelled their presidential primary for 2020). Last spring, Tim Castro, a leader with Independent Voters for Arizona, and Cathy Stewart met with Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes. &nbsp;The Recorder administers the elections, and Maricopa County is the largest in Arizona—the fourth largest county in the U.S. Adrian was elected in 2018 in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential primary debacle when thousands of voters stood on lines for hours because there were too few polling sites, and tens of thousands of independents were turned away. Adrian immediately took up independent voters’ cause and campaigned for the Democratic Party to pass a resolution at their September State Committee meeting to open their presidential primary.</p><p>Independent Voting turned up the heat on the Democratic Party with a hard hitting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eV1GIit7Pw\">social media spot</a> that drew attention to the issue and triggered a broad response, with 42,000 people watching the video on-line. One of IV’s Arizona donors saw it and liked it so much she funded a cable TV buy to broadcast it in metro Phoenix. Independent Voting pushed the social media campaign and got the press engaged in the story. They also sent volunteers to campuses in Tucson and Phoenix to speak with students and get their support.&nbsp; All the while, Adrian Fontes led the fight inside the Democratic Party, writing an oped, drafting the emergency resolution, and lobbying legislative district leaders.&nbsp;Fontes and Independent Voting’s Cathy Stewart were guests on <a href=\"https://azpbs.org/horizon/2019/09/new-ad-highlights-loss-of-voting-for-independents/\">PBS’ <em>Arizona Horizon</em> just 36 hours before the Democratic Party State Committee meeting</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The<strong> </strong>emergency resolution came before the plenary session of the Democratic Party state committee meeting and an intense floor fight ensued. The young leaders on the state committee, including many people of color, fought passionately on behalf of the resolution, demanding the party open the primary to independents.&nbsp;A reporter from <em>Arizona Republic</em> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OVyscA_1eYg\">livestreamed the floor fight</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the ballots were counted, the emergency resolution failed. The next day, <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2019/09/22/arizona-democrats-blow-again-stiff-arming-independent-voters/2412571001/\">the state’s leading political columnist wrote this</a> headline, “Arizona Democrats claim to be the party of inclusion. Just not when it comes to opening their presidential primary to those all-important independent voters.”&nbsp;</p><p>You would think that some Democratic and Republican chairs would be smart enough to open their primaries to independents….and some are. One of them was an honoree at the event, Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>NEBRASKA</strong> </h3><p>Jane is a prairie populist, best known for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBaPuPYsMrE&feature=youtu.be\">her work building a cross-ideological coalition</a> to defeat the Keystone pipeline.

Joe Walsh -- shared a stage at the 2019 Politicon in the last weekend of October.&nbsp;There was a lot of talk of Donald Trump. The conversation opened talking about impeachment, the word \"traitor\" was thrown around, followed by conversations about economic issues and foreign policy.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For a while, I was convinced that despite all the news of <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/in-wake-of-primary-cancellations-one-trump-challenger-calls-gop-a-cult\">canceled primaries</a>, <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/its-a-big-deal-that-republicans-dont-plan-to-hold-debates\">no RNC debates</a>, and <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/republicans-change-delegate-rules-to-silence-trump-opposition\">changed delegate rules</a> to make it harder for these candidates to get delegates and be competitive in 2020, there was going to be no discussion of it at all. And then, when asked about GOP policy, Bill Weld brought up the party's need to bring more voters into the primaries.<br></p><p>\"We need to expand the electorate voting in the primary,\" Weld said, specifically mentioning the need to bring in more Millennials and more women voters. He added that he has run ads targeted at independents and non-party voters in certain states, encouraging them to re-register with the Republican Party so they could vote in the primary in their state.<br></p><p>Then the subject quickly shifted to something else and there was no more talk of primaries.<br></p><blockquote>Weld is right. The parties should encourage more voters to be engaged in the primary process. Yet the parties often condition participation on party affiliation, telling voters to sacrifice their right to non-association in order to be able to vote for the presidential candidate they want.<br></blockquote><p>Weld brought up Millennials. Half of this generation <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/millennials-independence-poll-104401\">considers themselves independent </a>of the two major parties. In <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/08/08/9-states-registered-independents-outnumber-major-political-parties\">half the states that register voters by party</a>, registered independents outnumber at least one of the two major parties. In 9 states, independents outnumber both parties. Over 40% of voters nationwide identify outside the Republican and Democratic Parties and there is no telling how many people are registered with a party just to vote in the primaries.</p><p>I know these voters exist, because I&nbsp;talked to a few at Politicon. They said the only reason they are registered with a party is because they live or moved to a state that conditions their right to vote on party affiliation. As it stands, approximately 30 million voters will be denied the right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice in taxpayer-funded elections in 2020 because they don't want to be forced to join a party.</p><p>Expanding the electorate in primaries means creating a system that serves ALL voters -- and doesn’t give one or two groups and their members an exclusive advantage in the process. This is what the Independent Voter Project is <a href=\"https://independentvoterproject.org/work/california-presidential-primary-lawsuit\">arguing in California court right now</a>. If Weld wants an expanded electorate voting in primaries, he should come out in agreement that elections at every level should serve people, not parties.<br></p><p><em>Photo Credit: AP</em><br></p>","name":"Bill Weld: We Need to Expand the Primary Electorate","teaser":"Bill Weld almost had it right on primary elections during the 2019 Politicon.

Nettleton managed a team of professionals on behalf of the Independent Voter Project in 2007 and 2008 to analyze the possibility of moving Lindbergh Field’s terminals and building a Grand Central Station.<br></p><p>“The article really tells the story of that project,” Nettleton told me. “The two things converged when the new SANDAG (San Diego Association of Governments) executive director came in and announced his big new plans for a Grand Central Station.

Along with IVN, his work has been featured in Huffington Post, Fortune Magazine, San Diego Union-Tribune, San Diego Business Journal, Triple Pundit, and Air2Air Magazine.<br></p><p>He is also the founder of <a href=\"https://www.nettstrategies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nettleton Strategies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nettstrategies.com/CarlBio\" target=\"_blank\">an acclaimed speaker</a>, and an expert on the subjects of water, climate, sustainability, the ocean, and binational U.S. Mexico affairs. He has played a major role for over 25 years in addressing large regional issues in these areas, particularly in San Diego. <br></p><p>Nettleton told me one of his future plans is to relaunch an international ocean nonprofit that is going to address ocean plastic and trash, and plans to focus his future journalistic work on this issue, addressing the real problems no one is talking about.

Voters want to know more about what candidates really stand for in an election, but it is difficult to sift through the noise to find substantive information.</p><p>As the old adage goes: an informed electorate is an engaged electorate. Yet, there exists a disconnect between campaigns and voters that can often results in lower participation rates among voters who would otherwise be interested in voting.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://activote.net/\"><strong>Activote</strong></a> Co-Founder and CEO Victor Allis says this is why his team created a new app to remove the obstacles that stop people from participating in the democratic process. Activote “<a href=\"https://activote.net/about/#about-us\">uses data, not partisanship</a>, to empower people to vote in their local, state, and federal elections -- and encourage others to do the same.”</p><h4><strong>Download the app for </strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1457987563\"><strong>Apple App Store</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.activote.app\"><strong>Google Play</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h4><h2>Activote Gives Voters Easier Access to Elections -- On The Voters’ Terms<br></h2><p>Allis says that while working on a congressional campaign he noticed that campaigns have the most trouble connecting with constituents because&nbsp; “voters, for their part, try to shield themselves from all the incoming messaging that is inundating them.“<br></p><p>Voters often don’t have time for door-to-door canvassers and shield themselves from the&nbsp; “campaign sales pitch.” If a volunteer calls on behalf of a campaign, people often are more concerned with how the campaign got their number than what the campaign has to say. And that campaign mailer? It tends to go directly from the mailbox to the trash.<br></p><p>“But, on the other hand, when it is time for an election, people don’t know there is an election. Or, they know there is an election, but don’t know who is on the ballot, and as a result, lots of people don’t show up or don’t know who to vote for,” Allis says.<br></p><p>He added that as disappointing as he was by this, it was also a wake up call: In order to reach voters, he and a few others came to the conclusion that they needed to “flip the script.”<br></p><p>The goal of Activote is to allow anyone who would like to be an active voter to have every election in the palm of their hands -- “but on their terms, and by providing nonpartisan, factual, unbiased information.”<br></p><p>The app allows users to input their voter profile, and from there:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access information on upcoming elections in an individual’s area and candidates running;</li><li>Rank candidates in order of preference and see how candidates perform under a ranked choice system;</li><li>Answer daily questions on major political issues and policy using nuanced multiple choice options;</li><li>View where the user falls on the “political matrix” compared to political candidates in an election;</li><li>Set notification alerts to remind users of upcoming elections;&nbsp;</li><li>Check your friends’ voting status and information on their upcoming elections;</li><li>And more!<br></li></ul><p>“We believe a lot of people would like to go out and vote if it was made just a little bit easier,” Allis said, adding that while there is no single solution to getting more voters to the polls, the social incentive offered by Activote will lead to higher participation.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5db731b6d3db0ae35dbde40d_73C21EDE-AC40-43C8-A714-E0280AA8F4FE_iphonexspacegrey_portrait.png\"></div></figure><p>Allis says the goal is to “make sure every single election will be on the app.” For the most part, he says Activote is doing well in reaching this goal in major municipal districts.<br></p><p>One of the most challenging issues Activote faces nationwide are the smaller districts in the US that often don’t have electronically available data. Data providers, Allis says, either focus only on national races or only on local races in districts that are above a certain population.<br></p><p>Allis is optimistic though that as time goes on we will have access to more information, and thus Activote will be able to meet greater demand and expand its services.</p><h2>Activote Shows America Is Not That Polarized<br></h2><p>Activote gives voters an opportunity to see where exactly they fall on the “political matrix” by asking several policy questions on issues ranging from immigration reform to infrastructure to more in-depth issues like the liability of opioid companies in relation to the drug crisis.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The answers offered, though, are far more nuanced than the solutions and talking points that are often presented to voters by campaigns or in the media.<br></p><p>Allis’ position is that America is not as polarized as many like to think. Americans' views though are often not properly reflected through the lens of the black and white narrative in the media.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On an issue like abortion, for example,&nbsp; the conversation is often shaped as “abortions should be legal” vs “abortions should be banned.” However, Allis recognizes that most people’s views cannot be stuffed into a red or blue box.<br></p><p>So for each policy topic, Activote offers 5 positions. One option will be more progressive, something that a candidate like Bernie Sanders might defend. Another option will be a position that might be defended by a political like Ted Cruz or Mike Pence. The other three positions may be considered more libertarian or Green or middle-of-the-road.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5db72a12be275536c9dceda5_V4FBKcKqREXnLZlLQ9XOjFD7Lykz36Vp7MsMnxvISVmNhVCUCjO12SIaUWdU0Y1eFk59YQtCY66avfMMrzEfTL-RI7Fb-7upTwPoz43kKcruHDFlM8xQjK11ns-8uJJbQJA45YzX.png\"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;“The goal of that is to give people a chance to be more nuanced,” said Allis, “and when you look at the answers that our followers give, it is often that they give more nuanced answers.”<br></p><p>Activote also allows users to see, based on their responses to answers and the responses that candidates give, where they fall on the “political grid” compared to politicians running in elections in their district.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5db72a123f7e5e0d5dffc818_5b-EhH2gU7WFxsG8ePEVCJ_nrTPeCDm8RX6ZRavVK0eFrmdVBxZtZPpC0sbPIk8XZ166FmjD4rXYpLnA-gwQdPVczWyqE4s2e4gzxTty_0BCUTsFNOL9TZjEI8TmAp4yH6j0h59L.png\"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>In the event that a voter is not familiar with any or most of the candidates in a race, seeing which candidate they most closely align with can help them decide on election day who deserves their vote. Or, maybe the voter will discover that there is a choice that better represents their views than the person they were going to vote for.r.<br></p><p>“It is a helpful guide for users to see, ‘Hey, I seem to be close to this person. Let me research them a little bit more,” said Allis.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Download the app for </strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1457987563\"><strong>Apple App Store</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.activote.app\"><strong>Google Play</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h4><h2>Activote Offers An Easy Way to Show the Benefits of Ranked Choice Voting</h2><p>Victor Allis says he is a big proponent of ranked choice voting, the alternative voting method that allows voters to rank candidates on the ballot in order of preference rather than just choosing a single option.<br></p><p>“It is a much better way to vote than what we do today,” Allis said in our conversation. ”All sorts of things like vote-splitting, negative campaigning, etc improve when you have ranked choice voting.”<br></p><p>Activote, he says, is an easy and fun way to promote the benefits of ranked choice voting, and show just how easy it is.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5db72a124d39bc97ba0aaaf5_u_N7orwReD68spFZh-h7jlDDg6p6Y55o9ZcizyGZ0QB_LiGagwMkUxpegjwWxRsRgbvJ9XYctVPXjRRyrYu7BFYUMbfVaTxCHLpZHp1rfLxKu20wh7deDOPuhH2SjN8lDup0NCM4.png\"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>First, voters are allowed to fully express their opinions in a race. Rather than force voters to select only one candidate, they can rank candidates in order of preference, indicating the support they may have for more than one candidate in large candidate fields.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Second, ranked choice voting’s use in the app provides “instant gratification” to users as they can see how exactly support shifts in such a candidate field as the candidates with the least amount of support are removed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“It is a better user experience,” said Allis.</p><h2>Activote Allows You to Stay Informed and Keep Your Friends Informed&nbsp;</h2><p>In our interview, Victor Allis says a really important feature of the app is the ability to download all the contacts on your phone in the app, and then the app will try to match the contacts to their voter file based on their name and state.<br></p><p>“As a result, the app warns you when a friend has an election,” said Allis.<br></p><p>“You can imagine that for those people who feel really passionate about getting people out, now can they not only help people vote by joining a campaign or an advocacy group, but they can simply look at their own network and tell everyone, ‘Hey,&nbsp; you have this election coming up and I can see historically you have not always voted in local elections, so I just wanted to warn you about it.’ And then maybe they will tell their friends.”<br></p><p>Activote believes that “democracy is at its best when as many people as possible participate.” The app turns voter education into a fun social experience where friends can connect and keep each other informed on elections that will have a major impact on their daily lives.<br></p><p>Allis says Activote’s goal is to have a million users by November 2020. Right now, he says they are on target to reach this goal and can show that they can have thousands of users in a local area.<br></p><p>Allis adds that Activote has users in over 40 states.</p><h4><strong>Download the app for </strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1457987563\"><strong>Apple App Store</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.activote.app\"><strong>Google Play</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h4><p><em>Disclaimer: The publication and promotion of this article was paid for by Activote, Inc.

Fresh off a string of victories, the highly diverse, grassroots, non-partisan coalition of American election reformers is pushing full steam ahead for even more voting reform victories in 2019. <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/2019-sees-tremendous-surge-in-ranked-choice-legislation-nationwide\">Ranked choice voting is among their top priorities in 2019</a>. And the press has taken notice.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-ranked-choice-voting-is-not-the-way-20191010-glg3cvzu7vgfdaoitj22v4ety4-story.html\">Ranked choice voting comes under attack in the media</a> as it makes its way toward becoming official election policy in Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Wyoming.<br></p><p>One analyst / opinion columnist at the Washington Times wrote a piece entitled, “<a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/14/ranked-choice-voting-should-be-slotted-dead-last-a/\">Ranked-choice voting should be slotted dead last as election reform</a>.” The piece starts off with some good old-fashioned partisan fear-mongering:<br></p><blockquote>“Progressives are floating yet another election reform, Ranked-choice voting. It’s an idea so bad, even some dyed-in-the-wool liberals reject it.\"<br></blockquote><p>Election reform is non-partisan. It affects how candidates are elected to office, and does not favor any part of the political agenda or platform of the two major parties in America.<br></p><p>But its opponents in both parties like to paint it as a scheme cooked up by the other party. So for a conservative newspaper like the Washington Times, ranked choice voting is “yet another election reform” floated by “progressives.”<br></p><p>For a liberal newspaper like Slate, election reforms like <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/californias-jungle-primary-system-explained.html\">California’s top two open primary is a threat to Democrats</a>. But election reform isn’t about helping one or the other party win. <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/04/27/real-history-californias-top-two-nonpartisan-primary-electoral-reform\">It’s about empowering the voters</a> to make their voice heard in public policy, and making politicians more accountable to the electorate.<br></p><p>The anti-ranked choice voting editorial in the Washington Times goes on to claim:<br></p><blockquote>“In the end, a voter’s ballot might wind up being cast for their second, third or even fourth choice — a candidate they may actively dislike and never consider supporting. It rigs the system to allow candidates with marginal support to win elections. And voters can’t get around this problem by refusing to rank candidates they don’t like. That can end up costing them their vote altogether. The technical name for this is ‘ballot exhaustion,’ and it’s very real.”<br></blockquote><p>But this isn’t any different than the “pick one” ballot. On pick one ballots, your vote is exhausted after the first tally if your candidate got fewer votes than another. If this is a problem, at least with RCV ballots it’s actually less of a problem than with pick one ballots. This argument actually makes the RCV advocates’ point for them.<br><br>The editorial then makes this astounding argument against ranked choice voting:<br></p><blockquote>“This ballot exhaustion leads to the election of candidates who are not the first choice of a majority of voters. The only majority they’ve won is a majority of whatever votes were left in the final round of tabulation. The 2010 mayor’s race in Oakland, California, took 10 rounds of vote tabulation to get a winner. The ultimate winner received less than a quarter of the first-round votes, yet managed to pile up a 1.9% margin of victory in the final round.”<br></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/06/22/opinion-periodic-come-behind-win-ranked-choice-voting-whole-point\">RCV opponents continue to point to the election of Jean Quan in 2010</a> as an example of the failure of ranked choice voting. That’s because Quan went on to be a controversial, one-term mayor in the spotlight of national criticism over police handling of the 2011 Occupy Oakland protests. But critics are wrong on that count.<br></p><p>In 2010, RCV delivered Oakland its first female mayor, <a href=\"https://dailynorthwestern.com/2019/01/31/opinion/the-spectrum-saying-asians-arent-people-of-color-is-oppression-in-itself/\">a woman of color</a>, and a local city council member, who ended up beating an establishment politician, Don Perata, President pro tempore of the California State Senate from 2004 to 2008. That’s people power over party and establishment power.<br></p><p>Then when Oakland residents were unhappy with Quan’s performance as mayor, RCV proved itself nimble and eliminated Quan in the first round of tabulations in the 2014 election. Yet another example of <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/11/16/ranked-choice-voting-already-fixing-sky-high-incumbency-rate-congress\">ranked choice voting doing something about sky high incumbency rates</a>.<br></p><p>The Washington Times article concludes:<br></p><blockquote>“Ranked-choice voting is a confusing, overly complicated gimmick — one that allows candidates with only marginal support to win elections. This is one reform that would actually make the electoral system worse.”<br></blockquote><p>Yes, RCV supporters would probably agree that this ballot reform tilts the balance of power away from the established centers of political gravity and toward the marginalized. It’s an overreach to suggest, however, that candidates with “only marginal support” win ranked choice elections. It’s a system that incorporates more information about voter preferences into the election result. It allows more of the nuance of political support to filter through on election day.<br></p>","name":"Ranked Choice Voting Is Under Attack","teaser":"Ranked choice voting, an alternative ballot method, has been under attack by the press.

The <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/03/06/biggest-scandal-since-watergate/\">relentless clamor for impeachment</a>, along with the lack of anything substantial so far for Democrats to hang their hat on as an impeachable offense, smacks of partisan fervor and political gamesmanship, rather than serious and enlightened statecraft.<br></p><p>The loudest voices for impeachment <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/463576-why-impeachment-obsession-could-help-keep-president-trump-in-office\">appear to have their end in mind</a> ahead of any facts that might turn up impeachable offenses, and they’ve spent President Trump’s first term scouring for the facts to shoe-horn in to their predetermined agenda.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And so the impeachment wing of the Democratic Party appears to be all too eagerly weaponizing the impeachment powers in the Constitution as a means for waging partisan warfare against the president of the opposing party, rather than turning to it as a necessary contingency and end in itself in the face of an unequivocally impeachable offense.<br></p><p>This approach is unfortunately short-sighted and doesn’t hold the best interests of the voters and their democratic form of government in mind. Here are four reasons voter reform is a far better, and more permanent solution to the problems the most earnest Democrats are hoping to solve by impeaching Donald Trump.<br></p><h3><strong>1. Voter Reform Is More Democratic</strong><br></h3><p>Impeachment proceedings that are anything but firmly situated on a solid and irreproachable theory of impeachment, based on an unquestionable record of clear wrongdoing on the part of US officials elected to high office, undermine the constitutional prerogative of voters to self-government via the more-or-less orderly electoral processes of our democracy. Impeachment is a first step toward removal from office. If there’s any doubt about legitimacy of the charges against a sitting president, it’s more democratic to let voters remove them from office.<br></p><h3><strong>2. Voter Reform Creates Permanent Changes</strong><br></h3><p>If the Democrats were somehow able to muster an impeachment of President Donald Trump, take control of the Senate in 2020, try him, and remove him from office, that would be an enormous exhaustion of political capital and resources for a one-time fix of a one-time problem. <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/what-is-electoral-reform\">Voter reforms like non-partisan primaries and alternative ballot methods</a> create lasting changes that better qualify candidates for elected office over and over again in every future election.<br></p><h3><strong>3. Voter Reform Empowers Voters, Not Parties</strong><br></h3><p>But don’t forget that impeachment proceedings create permanent changes too. The way Democrats have used impeachment as a way to stonewall a Republican president nearly as soon as he took the oath of office, may set a precedent. As a columnist recently wrote at The Hill, the “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/465240-trump-impeachment-efforts-will-haunt-the-next-democrat-in-the-white-house\">Trump impeachment efforts will haunt the next Democrat in the White House</a>.” He points out we have transitioned since 2016 from the already oft-bemoaned perpetual election season, to the perpetual impeachment season. Fighting off never-ending impeachment pushes could now become par for the course for every sitting president. If that happens, it will increase the two-party system’s gridlock, hyper-polarized partisanship, and stranglehold over Washington politics.<br></p><h3><strong>4. Voter Reform Is Realistic and Practical</strong><br></h3><p>It is unlikely that impeachment will go anywhere. When Bill Clinton was impeached by the Republican House, he was exonerated by the Senate with a comfortable margin of Republican support. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/464379-mcconnell-vows-to-block-trump-impeachment-in-fundraising-pitch\">Mitch McConnell has already vowed to block impeachment</a> in the upper chamber. Recent polls show most Americans think Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/exclusive-poll-most-think-trump-will-be-impeached-and-win-2020-reelection\">will be impeached by the House and win reelection in 2020</a>. The Democrats pushing for impeachment have been spinning their wheels for going on four years. But election reform is achievable and creates practical solutions that voters of all stripes can support. In fact <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/11/19/everywhere-nonpartisan-reform-won-big-2018\">2018 was a landmark year for voter reform</a>. Ranked choice voting, alternative voting methods, and anti-gerrymandering measures passed in states and cities all over the country.<br></p>","name":"OPINION: Why Voter Reform Trumps Impeachment","teaser":"Here are four reasons voter reform is a far better, and more permanent solution to the problems the most earnest Democrats are hoping to solve by impeaching Donald Trump.","hero":{"fileId":"5da0d97fc975c0e0f5949db5","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5da0d97fc975c0e0f5949db5_190920110914-02-trump-oval-office-0920-exlarge-169.jpg","alt":null},"slug":"opinion-why-voter-reform-trumps-impeachment","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","author-s":["5d112fa1c8778d108da5fd18"],"topics-new":"5d0d0dfb2be7835ae576a5cc","updated-on":"2020-07-31T02:47:40.377Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","created-on":"2019-10-11T19:37:58.502Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-07-31T17:34:59.536Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5da0da16c975c0de8f94fa69"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"media":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPcGFjyGxI4","metadata":{"width":854,"height":480,"html":"<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FdPcGFjyGxI4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdPcGFjyGxI4&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FdPcGFjyGxI4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>","aspectRatio":0,"title":"Tulsi Considers Boycotting Debate","provider_name":"YouTube","type":"video","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPcGFjyGxI4/hqdefault.jpg","description":"Take the survey → https://tulsi.to/DNCsurvey I want to thank you all very much for your support.

This while the Arizona Republican Party canceled its presidential primary, leaving the door open to the Democrats to cast themselves as the party of inclusion and democracy.</p><p>It’s difficult to know whether this decision was merely a blind spot of epic proportions or a savage claim by the party’s old guard to control its turf. At the state committee meeting, it was younger members and many members of color who stood with Fontes, while he was shut down from the podium in the middle of his explanation of the resolution.</p><h3><strong>Florida is making similarly stupid moves</strong></h3><p>This affliction is not confined to Arizona.</p><p>On October 13th, the Florida Democratic Party will hold its statewide meeting. Several months ago, the Miami-Dade County Democrats passed a resolution calling for the party to open its presidential primary to independent voters. Other county organizations followed suit.</p><p>But then the state party leadership decided to amend the resolution, dictating only that independents be allowed to re-register only as Democrats on the day of the election.</p><p>Asking the state committee to vote on this amended resolution is a fraud (and farce), given the party has no authority to change voter registration laws. In other words, they refused to make the democratizing change they have the power to do.</p><p>They chose instead to create a fig leaf they have no power to enact. That is hypocrisy, plain and simple.</p><h3><strong>No wonder voters want independence</strong></h3><p>At a national level, independent voters are determining the outcomes of elections. They propelled Barack Obama to his party’s nomination and the presidency in 2008. A majority voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Then they gave Democrats control of the House in 2018 by a 12-point margin.</p><p>Uncategorizable by traditional ideological metrics, independents share a deeply held desire for something other than the partisan status quo.</p><p>The current showdown in Washington over a possible impeachment of the president, whatever its outcome, will highlight the extent to which our government is being held hostage by partisan interests on both sides. This abuse of power is what drives independents to be independents. And the longer the parties try to keep us at bay, the more devastating the consequences.</p><p><em>Editor's note: This article </em><a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2019/10/03/democrats-keep-independents-out-presidential-primary-how-stupid/3808000002/\"><em>first appeared</em></a><em> in the Opinion section of the </em>Arizona Republic<em> on October 3, 2019.</em></p>","name":"Suicide by Stupidity?

The post-truth era is real — and has tragic consequences.<br><br>The good news is we’re certainly not helpless. We don’t have to feel vulnerable, duped, or exploited. By having agency, we can harness the facts — and not just in politics, the news, or social media, but also in our everyday lives and workplaces, where powerful people, ideas, and messages can unduly influence us, too.<br><br>Like it or not, we often adopt the views of those we perceive as strong, attractive, confident, or resolute. And highly polished or emotional messaging frequently sways and seduces us. That’s because politicians, marketers, business leaders, and others are adept at reading us — recognizing our wants and needs, and then acting (or acting as if) to meet them.<br><br>And that’s where agency comes in.<br><br>The power of agency<br><br>Now you’re probably asking, What is agency, anyway?<br><br>Agency may be a simple word, but in psychology and social science, it has a profound impact on our lives.<br><br>In the real world, agency is our capacity to think and act independently, and to make free, autonomous choices. It’s our ability to function as an effectual agent for ourselves — to reason and behave in ways that benefit not only ourselves, but also the people we care about. It allows us to trust our instincts, to thoughtfully respond (rather than just react) to things, and to judiciously evaluate others. And it helps us conquer obstacles, make effective decisions, and create a life on our own terms.<br><br>But it’s not as simple as it may sound. Just ask Mike.<br><br>The hypnotist and the financier<br><br>A smart, self-assured guy in his early fifties, Mike has been around the block in life, and takes pride in being his own man. He has agency, to be sure, and likewise, has never seen himself as unwise or gullible. But that changed one night on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.<br><br>“A hypnotist got me,” Mike admits sheepishly. “My wife and I went to his show after dinner. He was a heck of a performer and a smooth operator, and before long, he managed to get me up on stage. Pretty quickly, I was like putty in his hands, seeming to robotically respond to his every whim. When we got back to our cabin, my wife said I was acting clueless. And me? I didn’t recognize myself. What a sucker.”<br><br>More seriously, and with a lot more than his ego on the line, Mike would later be led into a bad financial investment. “In looking back, I trusted the guy too fast,” he explains. “Yes, he was slick, but pretenses aside, he struck me as a smart guy and a savvy financier. Plus he had a sincerity about him, like he really had my best interests at heart.”<br><br>Mike soon learned that the man’s advice was anything but legit. And much to his chagrin, he had to face the music: He had been played like a fiddle.<br><br>Mike’s experiences with the hypnotist and particularly the financier got him questioning himself: Am I actually the smart, strong-minded guy I’ve always professed to be?<br><br>The short answer: Yes.<br><br>But even people with agency can be susceptible to smooth operators and slick presentations. It happens less often, though, because they possess two key differences.<br><br>Acknowledgment and action<br><br>People with agency acknowledge their own vulnerabilities and, even more important, take appropriate action.<br><br>They look within themselves to study their tendencies and patterns. (“When do I seem to be most impressionable? When I’m feeling anxious or afraid? When I’m really tired or hungry? When I’m being put on the spot? When I’m with people above me in rank or stature?”) They watch for their weak spots. They show a healthy skepticism. They question things that appear too good to be true. And they listen to their gut.<br><br>At the same time, it’s important to note that people with agency aren’t close-minded or oppositional. They know that, to grow and evolve as human beings, it’s critical to be open to new and different ideas, people, situations, and ways of thinking. It’s just that they do so with their eyes and ears wide open.<br><br>Want to have agency yourself? Or wish you had more of it? Try these seven tips.</p><p><strong>1. Hit the pause button.</strong><br><br>If something isn’t adding up, start by slowing down, taking a deep breath, and if possible, walking away for a while. You’ll think more clearly and independently whenever you can hit the pause button.<br><br><strong>2. Consider what you’ve just read or heard.<br></strong><br>Mull things over in your head. Then consider how they line up with who you are, what you stand for, and how you genuinely want to participate in the world.<br><br><strong>3. Be a fact-checker.</strong><br><br>“Facts are stubborn things,” said Founding Father John Adams. So pursue them methodically and tenaciously, as if you’re a fact-checker at a world-class newspaper or magazine. Contact real people in the know. Search for credible data on the web. Check with independent sources. And turn to trusted friends or colleagues to see what they think.<br><br><strong>4. Ask probing questions.</strong><br><br>Pretend you’re a top investigative journalist or talk-show host, and ask people probing questions that readily build on one another. For instance, in our line of work, we often start out with something like “That’s interesting. How did you arrive at that idea? And what steps did you take to get there?” What we’re looking for is a thought process or a set of actions that seems sensible and authentic.<br><br><strong>5. Check your emotions at the door.</strong><br><br>When you’re in a highly emotional state — angry, aroused, afraid, etc. — you’re apt to lose logic, become impulsive, and make poor or stupid decisions. It’s not easy or natural to keep your emotions in check, but you can at least aspire to it when it’d be helpful to you.<br><br><strong>6. Know your personality.</strong><br><br>Some personality types are more at risk for easily believing or conforming to others. If you know that you’re a people-pleaser or, like Mike, a harmonizer, consciously work at improving your BS detector.<br><br>Finally, know that balance is key. Of course, you want to engage with the world, to take part in politics or popular culture, to be liked and accepted by others, and sometimes to just feel free and easy. And that’s all perfectly right and good.<br><br>But, particularly in the post-truth era, you must also be able to think and act independently, and to make your own free choices. In this way, you will have agency — and harness the facts.</p>","name":"6 Ways to Have Agency — and Harness the Facts — in the Post-Truth Era","teaser":"We can no longer deny that we are living in a post-truth era.

After the initial tally of votes for San Francisco mayor, London Breed had 37%, Mark Leno had 24%. Then ranked-choice voting’s instant runoffs kicked in--due to the non-majority result--and Leno and Breed were suddenly neck-and-neck. &nbsp;</p><p>Breed’s and Leno’s collective 61% totals meant that 39% of voters had chosen one of the six other candidates on the ballot. &nbsp;As all of those others were eliminated, RCV did its job of determining the support for Breed and Leno among those voters—through their second and third choices. All told, Leno added 52,015 votes to his tally, compared to Breed’s addition of 23,856, lopsidedly favoring Leno and allowing him to catch up.</p><p>That ratio favored Leno so dramatically because he had split the vote with fellow progressive, Jane Kim, who also received 24% of the first-round vote (slightly behind Leno). When Kim was eliminated in the last round of the instant runoff, her voters chose the more closely aligned Leno over more business-friendly Breed by well over a 3-to-1 margin.</p><p>In the end it wasn’t enough. Eight days after the election, Mark Leno bowed out quietly and gracefully, conceding his hard-fought race to London Breed. As of the current count, he lost by just over 2,500 votes, about one percentage point.</p><p>But Leno led the race for three days following the election—while many mail-in votes were being counted (amidst record turnout). &nbsp;</p><p>While Leno was leading, many were crying foul. Why? Many SF voters are apparently not entirely comfortable with the possible come-from-behind win that is the whole point of ranked-choice voting. &nbsp;</p><p>“Just like Quan,” grumbled some. They were referring to the 2010 Oakland mayor’s race in which Jean Quan came from behind in the first tally, to beat Democratic Party insider, Don Perata. Quan went on to be a controversial single-term mayor, and RCV continues to suffer the fallout for having delivered her to office.</p><p>People who cry “Quan” are missing the point. RCV had determined—accurately in my opinion—that a majority of voters preferred Quan to Perata on election day. What more can you ask? No election method could have said if she would be a good mayor.</p><p>Hand-wringing from Breed supporters continued. “Leno and Kim colluded,” said some. “It’s not fair.”</p><p>Yes, they did collude—they even advertised their collusion. Ranked choice calls for candidates to seek those second-choice votes. If someone has an “Angela Alioto for Mayor” sign in their window, London Breed might still knock on that door, and say “If Angela doesn’t prevail, I want your vote. Would you rank me second for the instant runoff?”</p><p>Candidates have to do more than just trash all their rivals. They have to win majority support, some of which will likely come from their rivals’ voters.</p><p>I voted for London Breed, and I congratulate her. But I would have embraced RCV’s determination of Mark Leno as the winner even if he had come from behind.</p><p>Why not allow Breed to win with 37% and end it? That would mean declaring a winner even though 63% of voters chose another candidate. Sadly, that’s the system we have in most of this country—plurality winners.</p><p>That third candidate is often deemed a “spoiler.” That problem may seem trivial, but it is what you have to thank for giving us the two-party stranglehold in Washington and our statehouses. &nbsp;</p><p>Our voting system is an archaic albatross that most other democracies have moved beyond.</p><p>Voters were reluctant to pull the lever for Nader in a swing state in 2000 (and rightly so), or to vote Jill Stein or Gary Johnson voter in 2016. &nbsp;The same principal would apply in the SF mayor’s race—particularly with many candidates--if a plurality wins it.</p><p>There should not be such a price to pay for casting vote for your sincere choice of candidate—candidates should be able to run without fear of spoiling, and voters should be free of spoiler concerns when casting a ballot.</p><p>Ranked-choice voting removes those unintended consequences. You vote your conscience, period.</p><p>Back to the here and now. If you are among the 44,724 Jane Kim voters that ended up in Leno’s column in the final tally, you should have no regrets. Even if neither Leno nor Kim won, your vote counted for Leno in that final round. Your vote was not wasted.</p><p>Likewise, if your vote transferred to London Breed after your top choices were eliminated, you’re part of the group that brought Breed from 37% to 50%+ and victory. &nbsp;</p><p>How else can you get to a majority? If you conduct a separate runoff election of the top two, it’s another trip to the polls, it’s expensive and it’s low-turnout. Prior to RCV in San Francisco, it was not uncommon for turnout to decline by over 40% in the runoff.</p><p>Ranked-choice voting takes one election with many choices and gives a majority result.</p><p>San Francisco was on the front end of adopting RCV, and we have been followed by many other cities nationally. With RCV passing statewide in Maine, it is becoming this better method’s day in the sun.</p><p>All in the past month, ranked choice has been recommended by editorial boards of the<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/opinion/ranked-choice-voting-maine-san-francisco.html\"><em>New York Times</em></a>and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/give-ranked-voting-a-shot-our-democracy-would-benefit/2018/06/14/73c59356-6835-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html\"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, and featured by<em>NYT</em>columnist David Brooks in a column titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/opinion/voting-reform-partisanship-congress.html\">One Reform to Save America</a>.</p><p>As a San Francisco voter, I felt lucky to have had more than two choices for mayor, and not to have to wait for a second-round runoff to get a majority outcome.

Recent poll results show four candidates splitting the vote. Talk of “spoilers” is rearing its ugly head, again. Rather than discussing all of the candidates’ qualifications, voters are forced to consider the possible adverse consequences of a vote outside the two major parties.</p><p>Many must be asking: “Wasn’t ranked-choice voting going to solve this?” The answer is yes, it <em>would</em> have solved it. But our state lawmakers are hiding behind a constitutional technicality they could easily fix.</p><p>Some historical context may help. Maine’s original 1820 constitution required a majority outcome to win an election of the state’s governor or for its lawmakers. If no majority was achieved in the vote for governor, the election was referred to the House and then the Senate for a somewhat-bizarre runoff sequence. For lawmakers, the constitution called for rematches until a majority was achieved.</p><p>Those procedures apparently failed. A controversial result in a three-way race for governor in 1879 resulted in an armed standoff in Augusta. Diffused by Civil War hero Joshua Chamberlain, the crisis ultimately spurred an 1880 constitutional amendment that made a plurality acceptable (the most votes wins even if its less than 50%).</p><p>Maine’s founding fathers may have understood the perils of plurality results. If the “spoiler” label had not yet made the scene, the concept was surely well understood.</p><p>Had an easy method of achieving that majority been available at the time, Chamberlain and other state leaders might have reached for it. But it wasn’t. The path of least resistance at the time was to accept a decidedly lesser standard — plurality winners.</p><p>Fast-forward a century to the 1970s — Mainers, yearning to break free of the two major parties, began casting votes for outside candidates in large numbers.</p><p>Starting with independent Jim Longley in 1974, five Maine governors would win office with less than 40% support.</p><p>This includes the two most recent governors -- Democrat John Baldacci, who won re-election in 2006 with just 38% of the vote, and Republican Paul LePage, who achieved the same margin in 2010.</p><p>Mainers grew weary, knowing that 62% of voters had not supported the winner in back-to-back races.</p><p>Enter retired independent state senator Dick Woodbury. He seized upon the tool that leaders of the nineteenth century might have embraced. Ranked choice voting (RCV) is a system that conducts instant runoffs based on voters’ candidate rankings. RCV produces a majority outcome in one election even with three or more candidates running.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/05/08/ranked-choice-voting-work/\"><strong>How Does Ranked Choice Voting Work?</strong></a></p><p>The scholarly and nonpartisan Woodbury then led a citizens' initiative that was approved by Maine voters by a four-point margin in November 2016.</p><p>Fond of their collective monopoly, major party bosses didn’t share Maine voters’ enthusiasm for an improved system. RCV would make it too easy for voters to vote outside the two major parties without consequence.</p><p>With greater support from their base (“it’s all about LePage!”), GOP insiders took the lead in torpedoing the voters’ choice of RCV. They challenged the new law based on that 1880 plurality amendment.</p><p>The Maine Supreme Judicial Court <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/05/23/breaking-maine-supreme-court-says-ranked-choice-voting-unconstitutional/\">validated the constitutional concerns</a>. With no intent to alter the constitution, lawmakers from both major parties voted to pass a “<a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/10/23/voters-betrayed-maine-lawmakers-set-ranked-choice-voting-repeal/\">delay and repeal</a>” bill that spelled doom for RCV.</p><p>Not so fast, said supporters. The rarely-used People’s Veto <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2018/06/12/ranked-choice-voting-stands-maine/\">passed by a resounding eight-point margin</a> this past June. Rejecting and overriding self-interested parties, this result reinstated the portions of the law that are without any constitutional question — all primary elections and the general elections for US Senate and House.</p><p>But importantly, RCV does <em>not</em> apply for governor or for state lawmakers in the November general election.</p><p>Here’s what’s most ironic: While Maine’s GOP bosses have vociferously opposed RCV, they have separately adopted instant runoffs and majority outcomes internally. In 2016, the party brass adopted “Procedure for Elections” that read as follows:</p><blockquote><em>“…Each officer shall be elected by a majority of the voting members of the State Committee…in each officer election if, on the first ballot, no one candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the candidate receiving the least number of votes shall be eliminated and a second round of voting will be held. Balloting shall continue in this manner until one candidate receives a majority vote.”</em></blockquote><p>This method is virtually identical to RCV.</p><p>Mainers know that a system that cannot accommodate a third candidate is broken. They twice voted for a solution that restores the majority outcomes that Maine’s founders prescribed. Party leaders continue to behave with self-interest and hypocrisy. They hide behind a constitutional technicality that they could easily correct.</p><p>As Mainers struggle with the four choices for governor with a system equipped for two, they should remind their lawmakers that they twice voted for a better way.</p>","name":"In Maine: Partisan Hypocrisy Protects Minority Rule in Governor's Race","teaser":"In November, Mainers will vote for governor.

But candidate success outside the major parties remains elusive in Washington.</p><p>All 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives are Democrats or Republicans. Across the Capitol, there are two of 100 senators with “(I)” after their names -- Sen. <a href=\"https://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> of Vermont and Sen. <a href=\"https://ivn.us/tag/angus-king\">Angus King</a> of Maine.</p><p>But wait, there is another pool to look at. State legislatures are the farm teams to the Washington’s big leagues. Does the two-party duopoly hold consistently there, too?</p><p>The short answer is a definitive YES, but there are some states -- particularly in New England -- that are leading growth in independent and third party representation.</p><p>Here's a breakdown. It turns out that just 40 state legislators are either independents or third party out of 7,383 seats total.</p><p>This calculates to about 1 in 185 seats nationally. That remains “black swan” territory—an extremely unusual occurrence.</p><p>As of today, just 12 states have these independent or third-party legislators, as follows:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d965308c2408b0637f9bc65_Screen%20Shot%202019-10-03%20at%2012.58.44%20PM.png\"></div></figure><p>On the flip side of that list, the Democrats and GOP have 100% of the seats in the remaining 38 states.</p><p>With approximately 42% of U.S. voters identifying as independents according to Gallup, the gap in representation is staggering.</p><p>But Vermont and Maine provide real cause for optimism, with “critical mass” groups of lawmakers outside the two parties. Also encouraging, a handful of other states have a foothold of two or more non-two-party members.</p><p>Beyond geography, what I discovered about these “Outside 40” were three broad groups, as follows:</p><ul><li>14 were initially elected to their current seat while running as an independent.</li><li>16 were elected to office as a Democrat or Republican, but left the party, while in office, to become an independent or to join a third party; and</li><li>10 were elected under a third-party label, and benefited from “fusion voting,” which allowed them to run also as a Democrat in both the primary and general elections.</li></ul><p>The breakdown by state of these three groupings is as follows:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d965308c2408b0637f9bc65_Screen%20Shot%202019-10-03%20at%2012.58.44%20PM.png\"></div></figure><h2>The Few Elected As Independents</h2><p>Just five states have a combined 14 legislators that ran as an independent when elected to their seat. If it’s this category that independent-champions hope to grow, what can we learn from these 14 successes?</p><h3>Vermont</h3><p>Vermont has demonstrated the most longevity and stability with independents. The full group is seven strong currently (this includes one GOP defector), up from three after the 2010 elections.</p><p>Five of today’s seven have been re-elected at least once as an independent. Two are serving their fifth term. &nbsp;Perhaps important for continued stability, Vermont doesn’t have term limits.</p><p>Barbara Smith Murphy is an independent first elected to the Vermont House in 2014, and re-elected in 2016. &nbsp;She did not accept outside donations in either of those races, spent less than $400 of her own money on her re-election bid, some of it on hand-made door-hangers that she would leave after knocking on each and every one of her constituents’ doors.</p><p>Murphy credits smaller, simpler districts — Vermont’s have 4,500 constituents -- where people vote for a person, not a party.</p><p>\"Between working as Clerk in my local post office for almost 15 years and serving on community boards for a cumulative of 25+ years, I didn't need the introduction to my constituents that my opponent apparently did.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Murphy’s GOP opponent outspent her by more than 20 to 1, a difference that made it a tight race. Murphy prevailed with a two-point margin. The Democrats didn’t field a candidate in Murphy’s district.</p><p>\"The paucity of willing and able candidates in small districts can make it difficult for the major parties to recruit,\" she added.</p><h3>Maine</h3><p>“The word ’independent’ is part of Maine’s heritage of self-reliance,” says Maine state representative <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/03/02/independent-legislator-maine/\">Owen Casás</a>. “And Maine has a history of electing a sprinkling of independent lawmakers and governors over time.”</p><p>Casás, a freshman (elected in 2016) independent and a former U.S. Marine, was elected in a squeaker in a heavily Democratic district. Maine’s Republican Party persuaded its (likely doomed) candidate not to run, giving Casás a two-person race.</p><p>Casás separately credits public campaign subsidies (<a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/ethics/mcea/\">Maine’s Clean Elections program</a>) for helping independent candidates, but also for lowering the spending generally in legislative races. Including the public subsidy money and the other small donations the program allows, Casás received a total of just over $8,300.</p><p>While both he and his Democratic opponent had to observe the spending limits that come with Clean Elections, the Democratic Party was free to spend on his opponent’s behalf, and did so to the tune of approximately $5,000.</p><p>“The party buys campaign materials for candidates all over the state, and they get a lot for their money. &nbsp;My opponent’s flyers just kept coming,” said Casás.</p><p>In the end, Casás won his race by 12 votes, or 0.2%.</p><p>“I think the party would have spent another $5,000 against me if they had known I would win,” said Casás.</p><h2>Louisiana and Alaska</h2><p>Another state with three elected independent lawmakers is Louisiana. &nbsp;They have used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 1977. It’s often called a “jungle primary” because all candidates regardless of party vie for the top two slots.</p><p>Unlike most others, it’s a method that puts the independent candidates on the primary ballot, giving them an earlier exposure to voters.</p><p>It’s unclear if the nonpartisan primary was a key driver in the independents’ elections. Two of the three Louisiana independents were initially elected in races where Democrats didn’t field a candidate. The third race saw an independent run unopposed to win a 2016 special election.</p><p>Lastly, Alaska has two elected independents that both benefited from races where Democrats didn’t run.</p><p>If there’s any pattern for these 14 successful independents, it’s lower-populations districts, and often initial election in races that one of the major parties sits out, removing the spoiler effect.</p><h3>Major Party Defections</h3><p>Maine has seen an unprecedented and bipartisan exodus from the two parties, with three Democrats and two Republicans jumping ship from their parties since January 2017.</p><p>Beyond Maine, major-party defections in eight other states have happened over time, and have provided 11 of the lawmakers in the “Outside 40” group of lawmakers. Noteworthy in this group are three newly-elected New Hampshire state representatives that all switched from Republican to Libertarian in 2017.</p><p>“Frustration with hyper-partisanship and gridlock in Augusta may result in more defections,” predicts Kyle Bailey, an experienced campaign professional who has worked on multiple independent candidate campaigns in Maine.</p><p><em>“An increasing number of lawmakers are watching their independent colleagues at work and they are seeing the benefits of serving in public office beholden only to voters, not to party leaders, special interests, or wealthy donors.”</em></p><p>Leading independent advocates say that while they will welcome the gains from lawmakers leaving the two main parties—granting them newfound incumbents—they won’t count on that. The strongest push will remain electing independents to open seats.</p><h3>Vermont Third Party Gains and Fusion Voting</h3><p>The Vermont Progressive Party (VPP) has grown their ranks from five legislative seats after the 2010 elections to nine currently (House and Senate). The party has been advantaged by “fusion voting” that Vermont and several other states allow.</p><p>A vestige of nineteenth century democracy, fusion was reborn in Vermont in response to vote-splitting as the Progressives and Democrats played spoiler to each other, causing periodic Republican victories. &nbsp;The consensus appears to be that fusion tickets have significantly lessened spoiler-generated success for the GOP.</p><p>All nine of the VPP’s sitting legislators (two senators and seven representatives) have run strategically as Democrats in the primary.</p><p>Gaining the nomination from both parties—usually through enough write-in votes on the Progressive ballot--and subsequently winning the general election under both party labels, these nine have chosen to align and caucus as Progressives.</p><p>“I run in the Democratic primary in order to give my constituents and supporters an opportunity to vote for me,” said Rep. Mollie Burke, a Progressive currently serving her fifth term. “Only a handful of voters will choose a Progressive ballot in the primary election, particularly in order to vote for statewide candidates on the Democratic ticket.”</p><p>“I then run as a Progressive/Democrat in the general election, and I am able to represent the interests of Progressives and progressive Democrats who constitute the majority of my district,” she added.</p><p>Burke characterizes relations between the Progressive and Democratic parties in her southern Vermont Windham County as cordial and mutually beneficial.</p><p>Rep. Robin Chesnut-Tangerman is another Vermont Progressive who had both nominations:</p><p><em>“A state Democratic Party leader called me the day after the primary to exert some pressure. He reminded me of all the support Iwouldn’thave if I went Progressive. It wasn’t subtle.”</em></p><p>The Vermont Progressive Party has one paid staffer statewide—a fraction of the state’s Democratic Party. As such, it was a tougher road for Chesnut-Tangerman, and the GOP candidate came after him hard:</p><p><em>“It was an easy choice--my ties to the Progressives are strong. All seven of us in the House have a longer history there.”</em></p><p>Chesnut-Tangerman prevailed in a close race.</p><p>Some feel fusion voting is an opportunity to help third parties elsewhere. The other eight states where it remains legal don’t demonstrate that success.</p><p>Separately, the arrangement is not without some controversy in Vermont. Terri Hallenbeck chronicles the tensions between Vermont’s Progressives and Democrats in an <a href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/vermonts-progressives-and-democrats-have-uneasy-ties/Content?oid=3616865\">August 2016 piece</a> in Seven Days magazine.</p><p>“Some wonder whether the Progressives are building a party or borrowing one,” writes Hallenbeck.</p><p>Still, fusion’s use in Vermont is growing third-party success and may continue to thrive. It may also show the two major parties elsewhere a productive approach to dealing with burgeoning alternative parties that are more and more apparent in their ranks.</p><h2>Support Needed for Independents</h2><p>Independents I spoke with express the need for support. The major parties hook their candidates up with voter databases, introductions to prior donors, endorsements, and party leadership who can marshal party money to a race strategically and quickly.</p><p>\"Several of my colleagues spoke of their envy for my independent status, but I reminded them of all their party does for them,\" indicates Vermont independent Rep. Barbara Smith Murphy. “As an independent, you’re really on your own, not just for the campaign, but also the guidance and information to evaluate legislation and do your job.”</p><p>Murphy says she and her fellow independent members have had to push to get some of the basic legislation information that the parties take for granted.</p><p>Maine’s Owen Casás echoes this point; he and his six colleagues outside the parties are working together to help each other:</p><p><em>“We’re independent, which means our values don’t always match up. We vote differently from each other, and that’s fine, but we can support each other’s ability to do our jobs.”</em></p><p>Casás says they are also asking for basics like offices to meet and other nonpartisan services that will help close the gap with the major party caucuses. He also plans to work with his six outsider colleagues to help new independent candidates avoid some of the basic mistakes of implementing a campaign.</p><p>“I made some rookie direct-mail mistakes because I didn’t have party help,” says Casás.</p><h2>Organizations Forming</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.centristproject.org/\">The Centrist Project</a> (CP) was co-founded by Charles Wheelan, college professor and public policy author.</p><p>In his recent book, <em>The Centrist Manifesto</em>, Wheelan lays out his premise that increasingly polarized, dysfunctional parties and gerrymandered districts have created a huge amount of room to run moderate independent candidates.</p><p>Separately, CP’s mission includes the “Fulcrum Strategy” – the theory that a small number of independents can deny either major party a majority, thus forcing them to come to the table to compromise.</p><p>Nick Troiano, the organization’s executive director, is confident that their growing staff can help independents with the tools they need to run for election.</p><p>Newly headquartered in Denver, the Centrist Project has current state-legislative thrusts that include <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/10/19/bombshell-new-survey-even-partisans-are-tired-of-the-two-parties/\">Colorado</a> and <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/05/24/centrist-project-announces-first-independent-endorsement-2018/\">Maine</a>.</p><p>Troiano says CP is explicitly partnering with Maine independents —those in office, those considering running, and those who may be considering un-enrolling from the Democratic or GOP caucus.</p><p>“We aim to provide whatever resources we can, including help with candidate recruitment, training, voter files, and candidate websites,” said Troiano.</p><p>On the money front, CP hopes to steer individual donors from their network to these candidates, and raise other money for “uncoordinated” promotional help for some candidates.</p><p>Back in Colorado, the Centrist Project will roll out a similar approach. &nbsp;They found that only ten independents ran for Colorado’s legislative seats in the past three cycles.</p><p>“Independents lack infrastructure and support of the major parties,” said Troiano. “Because of this, very few independents run in the first place.”</p><p>“The largest barrier independents face is psychological,” he added. “Once a few win, more will run, more voters will be inclined to vote for independents, and more will win. &nbsp;It's a virtuous cycle.”</p><p>Separately, Troiano says that he is currently talking to two Colorado legislators about unenrolling their major party. “As we saw with Maine, others will come along if they see a safe place to land. &nbsp;We want to provide that.”</p><p>Kyle Bailey is trying something similar in Maine by starting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/maineindependents/\">Maine Independents</a>.</p><p>Maine Independents has a mission to “give more voice to independent voters and more choice to Maine voters” by recruiting and training independent candidates to run for the Maine Legislature and supporting independent student groups on college campuses across Maine, among other initiatives.</p><p>Recently, Bailey and other political professionals and lawmakers led Maine’s first-ever training for independent candidates on how to run smart, winning campaigns for the Maine Legislature.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d9654bbad28efd7d5ad9967_Screen%20Shot%202019-10-03%20at%201.05.26%20PM.png\"></div><figcaption>Image: Maine Independents: &nbsp;Recruiting and Training session for Maine's next generation of independent lawmakers.</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>The concept of state organizations promoting nonpartisan candidates is gaining momentum. &nbsp;A similar <a href=\"https://www.waindependents.org/\">Washington Independents</a> organization just announced its formation in mid-November.</p><h2>Never A Better Time</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_members_of_state_legislatures_of_the_United_States#cite_note-UNBOUND-33\">list of third-party members and independents</a> that haveeverheld office in state legislatures is shockingly short. But the 40 current office-holders have more than doubled since 2010, and are up almost 40% since 2014.</p><p>And the energy for change is very high. Fed up with dysfunction that they blame on two-party polarization and gridlock, more and more Americans are becoming active in tearing down the status quo.</p><p>Organizations seeking fundamental change in our democracy are up dramatically from 20 years ago.</p><p>Moves away from plurality “first-past-the-post” elections—the system that many feel limits us to two parties—to majority-winner systems are getting some traction.</p><p>One of these majority methods is <a href=\"https://ivn.us/tag/ranked-choice-voting\">ranked choice voting</a> (instant runoffs), which recently passed a statewide ballot initiative in Maine. &nbsp;The increasingly popular option is in use in a number of cities and under consideration elsewhere.</p><p>California voted through a nonpartisan, “Top Two” primary in 2010, and there is much talk of other states copying this approach.</p><p>At the federal level, the <a href=\"https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=616\">Fair Representation Act</a>, which would end gerrymandering and implement a proportional approach to congressional representation, has been introduced.</p><h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2><p>Rest assured that change will not come without blowback. The two parties agree on the duopoly they have in power if nothing else.</p><p>Maine’s legislature recently <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/10/23/voters-betrayed-maine-lawmakers-set-ranked-choice-voting-repeal/\">passed a delay and repeal bill to kill ranked choice voting</a>, with the support of operatives in both parties. California’s party bosses will do the same to Top Two if they get the opportunity.</p><p>Those party leaders may view pockets of success of independents and third parties as small brush fires that need to be extinguished before they become unmanageable. They can and will precisely target legislative districts at the state and federal level to defeat an outsider.</p><p>Fearing this, past lawmakers who have left a major party while in office sometimes rejoin later rather than go it alone for re-election. Or they see the writing on the wall, and retire.</p><p>\"If the past is any guide, the parties will try to squelch any new threat to their power,” opines Centrist Project’s Nick Troiano.</p><p>Perhaps not a shocker, but still vexing for many, it’s hard to count on those in power to reform the electoral system that brought them to office. Survival instincts are very present--and fairness is all too absent--in the halls of power.</p><p>As such, citizens’ initiatives and referendums have been key.</p><p>There are many more mountains to climb. Ballot access laws often shut out thirds and independents and double-standards give party candidates meaningful donation advantages over independents.</p><h2>Here Comes 2018</h2><p>Back on the ground in Maine, Kyle Bailey says he’s looking at “unique circumstances” that could make 2018 a breakthrough year for independent candidates in Maine beyond their past gubernatorial wins and limited successes in the Maine Legislature.</p><p>He cites the re-election campaign of Maine’s popular centrist independent U.S. Senator Angus King and the open gubernatorial election, in which independents tend to perform better.</p><p>“A record number of independent candidates are expected to run in 2018, which could create real synergy between them and amplify a reform message that helps to catapult more of them into office,” said Bailey.</p><p>Nick Troiano and staff are gearing up for the dam to break, as well.</p><p>In their respective organizations, Bailey and Troiano also intend to look out for the independent incumbents out there that may face Democrat and/or GOP challenges.</p><p>Maine’s Owen Casás says that he’s aware the major parties may be gunning for his seat.</p><p>“I can’t worry about that just now. What I can do is my job—do my best to serve my constituents well. If I do that, then we’ll see about re-election,\" he said.</p><p>But 2018 looms. Up against two deeply entrenched parties for re-election every two years, Casás and his fellow independents can’t count on a fair fight.</p><p>Ever-optimistic, Casás summarizes the two-party challenge they may face with his version of a quote attributed to Marine Corps legend, Chesty Puller -- “We’re surrounded and outnumbered. That simplifies the problem.”</p><p>In a year marked by turmoil and dysfunction in both major parties, independents and third parties are also surrounded by supportive Americans seeking a better alternative.</p><p>‍</p>","name":"INCREDIBLE: Third Party, Independent Representation Up 40% Since 2014","teaser":"Voter distaste for both the Democratic Party and GOP seems to be at an all-time high.

We award that seat to the candidate with the most votes, even if it’s not a majority. </p><p>This is known as “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting\">plurality voting</a>” or “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting\">first past the post</a>” (FPTP). It’s also “winner-take-all” in that parties or independent voters whose candidate finishes second or worse get no representation in their district. Together, these are the key ingredients for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect\">spoiler effect</a>.</p><p>Comparing the U.S. electoral approach to the systems of the countries I examined, what differences or similarities do we see? What I found is as follows:</p><ul><li>10 of the 14 observed (G7 and OECD) countries have multi-member electoral districts, where several representatives (often many) are elected from a given geographic area.</li><li>All of the countries with multi-member districts also have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation\">proportional representation</a> (PR) in the math of their seat allocation—if a district with PR has ten seats and 30% of the voters choose a party or its candidates, that party’s candidates get three seats. Thus, unlike the US, minority factions in this example get representation if their votes reach approximately 10%.</li></ul><p>Countries with single-member districts (Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom) have the greatest dominance by the top two parties.</p><ul><li>France and Australia have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-member_district\">single-member districts</a>, like the U.S., but do not use plurality voting (FPTP).</li></ul><ul><li>France’s two-round approach has good multi-party success. In their system, a runoff of the top two candidates happens if there is no majority in the first round. &nbsp;This gives a majority outcome, and it removes the spoiler effect present in the U.S.</li><li>Australia’s preferential (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting\">instant runoff/ranked choice</a>) voting approach also defeats the spoiler effect, but through automatic runoffs based on voters’ candidate rankings. This also achieves a majority outcome but is slightly less effective in achieving seats outside the top two parties (and most electoral scholars concede that Australia is two-party dominant).</li><li>Canada and the United Kingdom are the most two-party dominant of the observed countries (84% and 89% dominance by the top two parties respectively). Both have the one-two punch of single-member districts and plurality winners (FPTP). &nbsp;Of the countries I observed, these two are most like the U.S. in election of their legislative bodies.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d964df36343f821a7c6280b_Screen%20Shot%202019-10-03%20at%2011.43.11%20AM.png\"></div></figure><p>Beyond the benefits present with single-member districts and plurality winners, the Democratic and Republican parties have feathered their own nests as follows:</p><ul><li>Restrictive <a href=\"https://ivnnews-archive.netlify.com/tag/ballot-access\">ballot-access laws</a> that create barriers unfavorable to third party and independent candidates;</li><li><a href=\"https://ivnnews-archive.netlify.com/tag/campaign-finance\">Campaign finance laws</a> allow virtually unlimited funding for parties, but severe limits for independent candidates;</li><li><a href=\"https://ivnnews-archive.netlify.com/tag/gerrymandering\">Gerrymandering</a> power, efficient and computer-assisted, is vested in Republican or Democrat hands in most states; and</li><li>An awesome fundraising infrastructure for ongoing gathering of vast pools of political support money (much of it from special interests) to be disbursed by party bosses to campaigns of promising party hopefuls like bets on the craps table.</li></ul><p>It turns out that the structural benefits the parties enjoy combined with the laws they’ve passed protecting themselves are an awesome combination, limiting competition from other parties and candidates to pretty much zero.</p><p>Not only do the two parties have a 100% lock in the US House of Representatives, but this is mirrored with few exceptions across our 50 state legislatures.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, both parties have also received the benefits accorded to private associations.</p><p>The Democrats use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate\">superdelegates</a> in their primary math and <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2017/05/02/courts-cant-protect-right-vote-private-corporations-control-elections/\">recently contended</a> in court that even if they did favor Hillary over Bernie, it’s an internal party matter and none of the Court’s business.</p><p>The GOP has its own version of funky math to choose its presidential candidate.</p><p>The two choices we get in most elections—presidential or not--are the product of the rules determined by the leadership in each of the two parties. &nbsp;(<em>I have previously referred to these as “country-club rules,” but this may be unfair to country clubs!</em>)</p><p>Altogether, this is a shocking litany of abuse, America!

Experts tell us that gives us two viable parties — no expert required to tell us that is precisely what America has.</p><p>In the quest to move away from plurality winners, the “top-two primary” and ranked-choice voting have emerged as two of the most achievable policy reforms.</p><h2>Top-Two Primary</h2><p>California’s top-two primary system passed in 2010 by ballot initiative. Since 2012, all candidates show up on one June primary ballot, including independents. The top-two candidates advance, <em>regardless of party preference</em>, to a November runoff.</p><p>This is true for all state and federal legislative elections, and all statewide elected offices, including governor.</p><p>Some of top-two’s advocates promised more moderate outcomes and more competitive November contests. &nbsp;This was a brilliant sales pitch in 2010. Safe-seat districts meant that the few voters in the favored-party that turned out for a June primary would determine the November winner. Incumbents rarely lost, and as such rarely had incentive to reach across the wide chasm that separated them from lawmakers in the opposing party.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=\"https://ivn.us/2014/07/23/top-two-primary-accountability-stupid/\"><strong>Top-Two Primary: It’s About Accountability Stupid</strong></a></p><p>Primary winners would often have vote totals that were well below 10% of a district’s voters, yet their November win was a foregone conclusion. It was democracy at its worst.</p><p>Advocates relish top-two’s attack on the two-party control of the primaries. Perhaps not surprisingly, the two major parties opposed the top-two initiative, and they have continued to loath it.</p><p>In a decidedly Democratic-leaning state, the Republicans complain when two Democrats advance. This has happened in a good number of legislative races since the system was implemented in 2012, and perhaps most notably when <a href=\"https://ivn.us/2016/05/31/how-democratic-party-lose-in-ca/\">Democrats Loretta Sanchez and Kamala Harris</a> both advanced to face each other in the U.S. Senate race in 2016.</p><p>But the opposite can happen if too many Democrats run in a district — a risk in a “blue wave” year like 2018.</p><p>Take a district that typically votes 60% Democrat, 30% Republican, and 10% other. Now picture a year when that primary ballot includes ten Democrats, two Republicans, and five others. Under this scenario, two Republicans could easily get the most votes and advance.</p><p>You can almost hear the intra-party arm-twisting and backroom deals being cut to keep too many Democratic candidates from staying in the race. Democrat and GOP bosses are developing a new skill set — candidate suppression.</p><p>Aside from those Democratic and GOP operatives, however, few in California are likely shedding tears over the two major parties’ angst about top-two. They want good government. But has top-two delivered that?</p><h3>Pros and Cons</h3><p>The 2018 election cycle will be just the fourth under top-two. Its success as a system has yet to fully play out. That said, there are early opinions.</p><p><a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/openprimaries/pages/418/attachments/original/1440450728/CaliforniaReportFinal8.24small.pdf?1440450728\">A study by proponents of top-two</a> points to a dramatic increase in the number of competitive November races and record numbers of defeated incumbents, with an additional key factor being independent redistricting that did not factor incumbency in drawing lines.</p><p>That study separately highlights the ability for <em>all</em> voters to participate in and impact the primary and the runoff election results. Finally, they claim that more broadly-elected lawmakers are not beholden to partisan primary voters and therefore are more effective in reaching across the aisle.</p><p>All of this makes total intuitive sense.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLE: </strong><a href=\"https://ivn.us/2016/12/15/top-two-still-shaking-up-california-politics/\"><strong>Independent Voter Project’s Top-Two Nonpartisan Primary Still Shaking Up California Politics</strong></a></p><p>On the negative side, critics would point to <a href=\"https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/amdem-_1.pdf\">a Stanford study</a> that says California top-two has had minimal impact on electing more moderate lawmakers. Still, others say that California is becoming a one-party state. &nbsp;No Republican has been elected to statewide office since 2006.</p><p>And those hopeful that a fully non-partisan election method might elect some independents or minor-party candidates have been sorely disappointed. California’s Assembly and Senate is 100% comprised of Democrats and Republicans, as are its statewide offices.</p><p>The non-partisan electoral playing field that top-two has created is clearly not enough to overcome major-party funding, campaign machines, and inertia.</p><h3>Popular So Far</h3><p>Overall, 60% of California voters approve of the system, according to <a href=\"https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/s_1217mbs.pdf\">a December 2017 study</a> by the Public Policy Institute of California, and perhaps the best tribute to it is the number of states that are talking about copying it.</p><p>There are 4-5 states where top-two has been introduced as legislation. Hurdles to enactment in most remain high, but perceived success of the system is causing a buzz.</p><p>While the fanfare has been all about California, perhaps due to its size, Washington has the same system. &nbsp;Nebraska has top-two just for its state legislature. Louisiana has no primary, but a non-partisan general election ballot that moves the top two to an immediate runoff if no candidate has a majority.</p><h2>Ranked Choice Voting </h2><p><a href=\"https://ivn.us/tag/ranked-choice-voting\">Ranked choice voting</a> (RCV) is another voting method that moves away from plurality winners. Voters rank their choices, top choice, second choice, etc. — ideally of all candidates on the ballot. If no candidate gets a majority of first-choice votes, the ranked ballots then allow the field of candidates to be winnowed methodically through a series of instant runoffs.</p><p>In successive rounds, the lowest vote getter is eliminated, and his or her votes are transferred to the next remaining candidate ranked by the voter. A majority winner ultimately emerges, arguably with the broadest support.</p><p>RCV is a versatile tool that can be used in a primary or general election and in a partisan or non-partisan context. It can be used to combine a primary and runoff into one contest.</p><p>Five southern states even have their overseas voters use it in all their congressional elections that might have runoffs.</p><p>RCV has won passage statewide in one case, <a href=\"https://ivn.us/tag/rcv-maine\">Maine</a>, where it is currently being implemented for all primaries and for its U.S. House and Senate races.</p><p>RCV has otherwise gained traction much more at the local level. Cities such as Minneapolis, San Francisco, Santa Fe, Portland (Maine), and several others use the method for less partisan or non-partisan elected offices, including mayoral races.</p><p>Still other cities are currently considering making the change to RCV. The selling point for those cities and towns: One RCV election can deal with a fractured field of candidates and produce a majority winner.</p><p>In many cases, this can allow the elimination of a costly and low-turnout primary or runoff.</p><p>Perhaps spurred on by success on the ballot in Maine, RCV is under legislative consideration statewide in several states as well.</p><h2>Comparison</h2><p>RCV proponents claim — credibly, I would surmise — to have the more elegant and pure solution. But RCV often faces “it’s too complicated” objections. These objections will abate with its growing familiarity.</p><p>Top-two is a blunter, less-perfect instrument. It restores a majority outcome, but at a cost of only two November choices — and few outside the two major parties have advanced to the November runoff.</p><p>Separately, vote-splitting in its many-candidate primary may prevent the strongest two candidates from advancing. It is far from ideal policy.</p><p>But what top-two lacks in finesse, it makes up for with simplicity. Everyone on the same ballot, top two advance to a runoff. Parties don’t matter. Voters get it.</p><p>Perhaps due to its simplicity, top-two may be an easier sell in some states than RCV.</p><h2>Competing Methods That Should Merge</h2><p>So far, RCV and top-two have been mutually exclusive solutions. But might a marriage of top-two and RCV be a step forward?</p><p>With this approach, more candidates — perhaps up to five — would advance from the non-partisan primary. &nbsp;Policy experts say that a threshold of viability would be important — perhaps only candidates with greater than 5% could advance. “Top 5 over 5%” fits nicely on the bumper sticker.</p><p>Ranked choice voting would then be used in November to achieve a majority.</p><p>Here are the benefits:</p><ul><li>More choice in November — five being greater than two;</li><li>RCV in November eliminates “wasted votes” or unintended consequences of supporting a lower-odds candidate;</li><li>Far less likely that a major party would be shut out from the November ballot;</li><li>More chance for an independent or minor-party candidate to advance; and</li><li>Extremely high likelihood that no viable candidate is left behind.</li></ul><p>Ranking five choices is a manageable voter task that would be worth these benefits.</p><p>The move to “top-five” from top-two seems to ring so positively that it could carry the task of simultaneously selling RCV (whereas selling RCV on its own in many states may be too steep a climb).</p><h2>Work Together</h2><p>Some RCV advocates have opposed top-two. I think that approach is a mistake.</p><p>My advice to the RCV advocates: Continue to advance RCV wherever you can, but embrace the adoption of the top-two, non-partisan primary elsewhere. When a state has adopted top-two, look for the opportunity to advance one state to “top-five” (with RCV), and seize it. Perhaps that time is now in California?</p><p>Once top-five-with-RCV has worked well in one state, other top-two states will follow with this incremental change.

They argue:</p><blockquote>\"South Carolina law, the rules of the South Carolina Republican Party, and the South Carolina Constitution require that a political party use a fair process to determine which candidate the state party supports in the general election. They don’t necessarily require a political party to hold a presidential preference primary election in all presidential election years.Rather, they merely require that <em>if </em>a party wishes to cancel its primary, it must observe certain democratic safeguards that ensure that a party’s supporters—and not just a small junta of party bosses—support canceling the primary, and the party must instead choose which candidate it will support at its state convention.\"</blockquote><p>However, plaintiffs argue that the party didn't follow any of the democratic safeguards required by law. But it is not just state law. The plaintiffs point to a party rule that requires a presidential primary unless “decided otherwise by the state party convention within two (2) years prior to each presidential election year.”</p><p>They also say that the Republican Party has turned its back on its own principles:</p><blockquote>\"[T]he Republican Party has gone so far as to argue to a court that canceling a presidential primary would cause 'irreparable harm to the public interest' because 'the citizens of South Carolina deserve an opportunity to vote on the Republican nominee for President of the United States.'”\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote><blockquote>But here—for whatever reason—the State Executive Committee of the South Carolina Republican Party has not heeded its own wise counsel from 2014 and 2015. And its failure to do so violated its <em>own </em>rules, the South Carolina Election Law, and the South Carolina Constitution.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote><p>The Republican Party of South Carolina is one of <a href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/in-wake-of-primary-cancellations-one-trump-challenger-calls-gop-a-cult\">a handful of Republican Parties that have cancelled their 2020 presidential primaries</a>, denying even their own members an opportunity to vote for their preferred presidential candidate next year.</p><p>Read the full complaint:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-normal\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"normal\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"1280:720\" data-page-url=\"<p  style=&quot; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;&quot;>   <a title=&quot;View Former Republican US Rep.

They include retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis, former Nebraska Governor and Senator Joseph Robert Kerrey, former Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman, No Labels co-founder and former Connecticut attorney general Clarine Nardi Riddle, No Labels co-founder and Seventh US Comptroller General David M. Walker, and former New Jersey Governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman.<br></p><p>“The framework of our entire election process, including the presidential debates, gives the two major parties and their members a decided advantage. Politics is an industry, and many of the rules governing our election process were established not by a neutral arbitrator to achieve fair competition, but by the major political parties to distort the rules of competition in their favor,” the brief states.<br></p><p>The amicus brief was filed in support of Level the Playing Field’s appeal to the DC Court of Appeals after a lower court dismissed its lawsuit earlier this year. <br></p><p>IVP states that the existing rules, from exclusionary primary laws to the CPD’s 15% polling requirement, have exacerbated the nation’s political divide, damaged the democratic process, and disenfranchise a majority of the electorate while blocking qualified and credible challengers to the two-party status quo.<br></p><p>“Limitations on the participation of third-party and independent candidates from our presidential debates exacerbates divisions in America,” the brief says. <br></p><blockquote>“A substantial plurality of American voters no longer identifies with either the Republican or Democratic Parties. As hyper-partisanship plagues our media, our political discourse, and our electoral options, the non-partisan plurality of voters is forced to either embrace one side of this artificial division or not participate in the national dialogue at all.” <br></blockquote><p>The CPD asserts that its 15% rule, which requires candidates to poll at 15% in 5 national polls picked by the debate commission, is objective and reasonable. It maintains that it applies a nonpartisan approach to conducting debates.<br></p><p>However, the debate commission was created and is sponsored by the major parties. Its rules have been crafted by people with a political and financial investment in the continued codification of a two-party system.<br></p><p>It’s no wonder there has not been a third person on the presidential debate stage since Ross Perot in 1992. <br></p><p>The Independent Voter Project further argues that the interplay between the 15% debate rule and presidential primaries and caucuses further damages the democratic process:</p><p>Presidential primaries and caucuses, in every state, are private activities that serve political parties. In many states, only major political party members can participate at all. The primary election season now runs nearly a full year, and there is near constant media coverage directed almost exclusively on the major party candidates. </p><p>These primary elections are finalized less than two months prior to CPD’s presidential debates. And the polls used by CPD to determine whether a candidate is qualified to participate in the “non-partisan” presidential debates are conducted right after the grand finale: the nationally televised Republican and Democratic Party conventions.” <br></p><p>In order words, such a limited window and zero media exposure make it impossible for any candidate outside the Republican and Democratic parties to reach the 15% polling requirement.</p><p>“CPD, in conflict with its stated mission, has abdicated this responsibility by defending a rule that is so limiting on the marketplace for new ideas that no third-party or independent candidate has qualified for the presidential debates in more than two decades. When a significant plurality of voters does not feel represented by either major party, we have a heightened obligation to change the rule.”<br></p><p>Read the full amicus brief here:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-normal\" style=\"padding-bottom:80%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"normal\" data-rt-max-height=\"80%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"600:800\" data-page-url=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/427757346/IVP-Files-Third-Amicus-Brief-in-Presidential-Debate-Lawsuit\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fembeds%2F427757346%2Fcontent&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F427757346%2FIVP-Files-Third-Amicus-Brief-in-Presidential-Debate-Lawsuit&image=https%3A%2F%2Fimgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com%2Fimg%2Fdocument%2F427757346%2F111x142%2Fe1d695d607%2F1569617911%3Fv%3D1&key=c4e54deccf4d4ec997a64902e9a30300&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=scribd\"></iframe></div></figure>","name":"Independent Voter Project Files Brief Supporting Lawsuit Against Bipartisan Debate Commission","teaser":"The exclusionary presidential debate rules that prevent any candidate outside the Republican and Democratic Parties from participating is another critical cog in the anti-competitive electoral machine that is crippling our representative democracy.","slug":"independent-voter-project-files-brief-supporting-lawsuit-against-bipartisan-debate-commission","hero":{"fileId":"5d8e82bfdd7ffacc5459871c","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d8e82bfdd7ffacc5459871c_debates.jpg","alt":null},"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","author-s":["5d115cf9016d6fb8e778528e"],"topics-new":"5d0d153c39160a2289ec053a","updated-on":"2020-07-31T02:49:08.170Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","created-on":"2019-09-27T22:09:53.529Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-07-31T17:34:59.536Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5d8e88b1c8aa3519703c16ef"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"sticky":false,"publish-date":"2019-09-26T05:11:00.000Z","featured":true,"body":"<p>Democrats looking to make any headway in the 2020 elections might do better to keep their message positive and constructive, rather than rancorous and partisan.<br></p><p>A recent Monmouth University poll <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_082219.pdf/\">found that</a> a staggering majority of Independent voters oppose an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, even as Democratic Party leaders and their allies in the mainstream media make an aggressive push for impeachment.<br></p><p>The poll, entitled, “National: Potential Impeachment Impact on 2020,” and conducted by telephone with a random national sample of 800 U.S. adults from August 16 - 20th, found that a whopping 60% of Independent voters oppose an impeachment inquiry by the House Judiciary Committee. Only 34% of independents support impeachment.<br></p><p>Even among Democrats, 25% opposed impeachment in the survey responses, while only 2% of Republicans supported impeachment of their own party’s president, like Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), who made waves with his support for impeachment earlier this year.<br></p><p>The reasons given by opponents of an impeachment inquiry varied:<br></p><p>“Among those who say an impeachment inquiry is a bad idea, the top reasons include feeling that Trump has done nothing wrong (27%), it would be a waste of time and money (22%), the inquiry would be a partisan “witch hunt” (13%), Trump has done a good job as president (12%), and Congress should be working on other issues (10%).”<br></p><p>But what Democrats should especially pay attention to is how impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump would work at odds to the advantage the poll suggests they already have with the electorate sans impeachment proceedings.<br></p><p>Even though a majority of Americans of any political affiliation oppose impeachment (51% of the respondents oppose, while 41% are in favor of it), that doesn’t mean most Americans think Donald Trump should remain in the White House after the 2020 presidential elections.<br></p><p>In fact a stout majority (57%) of registered voters responded that Trump should be a one term president, while fewer than 4-in-10 voters (39%) said they want to see Trump reelected in 2020.<br></p><p>Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in his analysis of the poll results:&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Impeachment may not earn widespread support, but that does not mean most voters want to see Trump remain in office. It is just that the ballot box seems to be their preferred way to achieve his ouster.”<br></p><p>Impeachment then seems to many voters, especially independent voters, to be an undemocratic means of deciding who should be president and who should not. They seem to regard impeachment proceedings as voter disenfranchisement, and a misuse of the impeachment powers for essentially political purposes, which should be sorted out by the electorate instead.<br></p><p>Since the poll was published at the end of last month, Democrats have made a new push for impeachment on the basis of Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/25/764164340/trump-asked-ukrainian-president-for-a-favor-on-biden-doj-says-no-charges\">asking the</a> Ukrainian president to investigate a potential conflict of interests involving then-Vice President Joe Biden’s official involvement in Ukrainian politics that happened <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/9d4595ba4f3140c6bb6a3473a91f4a4c\">to favor</a> his son’s business dealings in that country.<br></p><p>It remains to be seen how this development has affected voter sentiment toward impeachment proceedings. But as Hillary Clinton piles on to the impeachment push against Donald Trump, a look back at the 2016 election may yield some insight. Clinton <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-should-be-impeached/\">told People Magazine</a>:<br></p><blockquote>“This latest behavior around Ukraine, trying to enlist the president of Ukraine in a plot to undermine former Vice President Biden or lose the military aid he needs to defend against Trump’s friend Vladimir Putin — if that’s not an impeachable offense, I don’t know what is.”<br></blockquote><p>But it’s not so clear that Trump crossed any legal or even ethical lines. After a whistleblower reported the conversation between Trump and the president of Ukraine to an intelligence watchdog agency and the controversy became public, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/09/25/white-house-releases-donald-trump-ukraine-call-transcript-nr-brown-lklv-vpx.cnn\">released the transcript</a> of the call. As the White House points out, there was no quid pro quo.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With Hillary Clinton back in the headlines over this controversy, it’s worth remembering how voters perceived the controversy over her hacked emails in 2016 election. The mainstream media wanted to take Trump to task for colluding with foreign powers to get access to these emails. It <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-committee-told-to-expect-word-that-mueller-report-has-been-delivered-to-attorney-general-barr-11553288563\">turned out</a> to be mostly a far-fetched conspiracy theory after the media pushed this narrative breathlessly for the better part of Trump’s first term.<br></p><p>What mattered to voters in 2016 was apparently what the emails definitely told them about Hillary Clinton, not the great pains Democrats took to twist the publication of those emails into an indictment against Donald Trump.<br></p><p>If Vice President Joe Biden did, in fact, use the power of his office to benefit family business interests, corrupting the integrity of U.S. foreign policy in a volatile geopolitical theater, why wouldn’t the current White House administration have a compelling interest to find out more about that? And why shouldn’t voters know about it?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Democrats’ strategy appears to be to fight transparency with every dubious legal means at their disposal, keep voters in the dark about the candidates they’re considering for the nation’s highest offices, and disenfranchise voters altogether by pushing impeachment proceedings instead of getting out the vote. It seems like plutocratic, Washington establishment politics-as-usual. That’s what got Donald Trump elected in the first place.<br></p>","name":"Survey Finds 60% of Independent Voters Oppose Trump Impeachment","teaser":"Democrats looking to make any headway in the 2020 elections might do better to keep their message positive and constructive, rather than rancorous and partisan.","hero":{"fileId":"5d8beff4a6a8d13595a5b69d","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d8beff4a6a8d13595a5b69d_trump.jpg","alt":null},"slug":"survey-finds-60-of-independent-voters-oppose-trump-impeachment","topics-new":"5d0d2fca0d07ae1b248dfccb","author-s":["5d112fa1c8778d108da5fd18"],"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","updated-on":"2020-07-31T02:44:09.352Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","created-on":"2019-09-25T23:04:32.368Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-07-31T17:34:59.536Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5d8bf280a6a8d1abcba68fc0"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"publish-date":"2019-09-26T01:54:00.000Z","body":"<p>US&nbsp;Rep.

To make it sustainable, it is not enough to leave out unhealthy items. Much more important is to focus on what is actually good for us. Which are the nutritious elements, the superfoods, the things we can mindfully enjoy and feel energised by? It is not about getting away from ‘bad food’ all together, but about knowing what it does to us, and how to balance it with healthier options.<br><br>In a world so overrun with bad news, we need a healthy dose of solutions journalism in our media diet. It’s not a hype, not a trend, and certainly not some form of escapism. Reporting on solutions as well as problems stops us from sitting at home feeling stuck in time and trapped in a state of overwhelming chaos. It does not require us to ignore negative news; in fact quite the opposite. For a solution to exist, there must be a problem to begin with. They are two halves of the same story. But we can’t wait for the world to be rid of problems before we start reporting solutions.<br><br>So, what is solutions-focused news? It typically includes reports on innovation, initiative, peace-building progress and positive responses to social problems. There are a growing number of definitions for solutions journalism; I define it to be ‘rigorous journalism that reports critically on tangible progress being made in order for us to understand how issues are being dealt with’. It has all of the characteristics of serious and well-respected journalism. The advocacy of solutions journalism is based on the assumption that inspiration is an important part of development.<br><br>There have been some powerful examples of solutions focused journalism emerging as the idea takes hold in newsrooms in the US and beyond. The BBC World Service survey of digital audiences found that 64 per cent of under-thirty-fives want news programmes to show solutions to the world’s problems. In fact, it was their top content request. The BBC listened. Their podcast The Inquiry featured a twenty-five minute segment on ‘What went right’ this year, in which they said that the ‘good news had been buried under the bad news’ and that they were going to uncover it and ‘gift’ it to us. They said they had selected ‘four amazing stories united by one thing – the ambition of a small number of extraordinary people to achieve the seemingly impossible’.<br><br>While the broadcasting of these stories represents huge progress for solutions journalism in the mainstream news, there is still a way to go. First, solutions news is not a ‘gift’ any more so than any other news story is a gift. Second, it is not a feat of a small number of ‘extraordinary people’, as the BBC described; it takes an enormous number of people to actually implement these kinds of solutions, even if they are instigated by a small group. We must remember this in order to remain empowered when we hear about such tales of courage, accomplishment and resourcefulness.<br><br>When we hear about these seemingly awesome acts, it is easy to think they are miracles performed by superhumans to whom we could never match up. This is usually not the case, and while we could admire and be inspired by their courage and initiative, we should not talk about them as if their achievements are beyond what we are capable of ourselves. It is instead perhaps better to think of them as ordinary people who achieved extraordinary things. It is, therefore, important to give prominence to the approach and method and not just to the person instigating it.<br><br>Think of it like a magic trick: if you just see the outcome it looks impressive, maybe even impossible. However, if you are let in on the process of the trick, rather than dazzled by the person performing it, it may not seem so impossible after all. Once you know it was a group of one hundred people who achieved a particular feat, or that it took fifteen years to accomplish rather than a week, you may feel more empowered – which is one of the central aims of the news, after all.<br><br>Keen to change your own media diet? My book ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-What-Read-ebook/dp/B07L35KXWK/ref=pd_ybh_a_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FWZG2SDQ8F0W1SM6F0P7\">You Are What You Read</a>’ gives you a step by step guide.

If they have watched it and aren’t freaking out over what they see, it’s fair to ask &nbsp;whether they actually want Donald Trump to win a second term. That session was a debacle for the party and the field: Nearly three tortuous hours of tails wagging dogs, petty sniping, and a lack of vision all the Lasik surgery in the world couldn’t cure.</p><p>The knock from Republicans, Never-Trumpers, and moderate Democrats is that most of the 2020 candidates are too far to the left and out of touch. Last week’s display confirmed it. This was a definitive example of a party controlled by its fringe elements, preferring purity over victory.</p><p>Houston featured a grab bag of turn-offs for independent voters. First, the elitist policy prescriptions put forth by most of the candidates have the dubious distinction of being out of step with most Americans while also being hugely expensive. Next, the field displayed an inability to understand that their words will reach the ears of all who will vote next November, not just those that show up to snowy Iowa churches in February.</p><p>Hewing to the base during primary season is nothing new. The new twist this election season is that most of the candidates leave themselves with almost no escape hatch back to the middle. It's as if they don’t want one. Two of the three Democratic front-runners, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are staking their candidacies on extraordinarily progressive stances on issues such as health care, the environment and the economy.</p><p>When moderators pressed Warren on whether middle-class taxes would go up, she bobbed and weaved to avoid an answer. Matching the unpopularity of your platform with a lack of candor about who will pay for it is rarely a path to electoral success.</p><p>Not to be outdone on the planetarily out-of-touch scale, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow D.C. Democrats are <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/nancy-pelosi-mitch-mcconnell-test-2ea79c0d-d59a-445b-bcec-8afdbf252b70.html\">reportedly planning</a> to target President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as prime examples of how the Republican Party disrespects all three branches of government.</p><p>This seems to be the type of data-driven, glossy argument that Beltway politicians and consultants love. After all, everyone in America hates Trump, McConnell and Kavanaugh, right? Maybe. Or maybe they don’t know them all that well (aside from Trump) and after all the terrible 30-second attack ads, voters will be in the same place they started: These guys may (or may not) be bad actors, but what are you offering instead? More bull about how the “process” matters? Yes, process and institutions matter, but for folks whose Job 1 is getting through the day or worrying about their kids' welfare, better government is a byproduct of vision and leadership.</p><p>This, at its core, is what’s so mystifying. An overwhelming number of Americans express displeasure with our political system. On any given day, well over 50% of the country says it’s unhappy with President Trump's words or deeds, and yet Democrats mainly offer grievance and anger to their urban, hyper-liberal base who think Twitter trolls are representative of America.</p><p>This is not a recipe for success. What propelled Ronald Reagan to the White House? It wasn’t anger and resentment. It was a vision of the United States, for all its problems, as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c32G868tor0\">City on a Hill</a>. Reagan believed in America and after four years of Jimmy Carter’s malaise, voters latched on.</p><p>How did Barack Obama become the first African American president in our history? \"Hope and Change\" and the ability to communicate that he was ready and willing to pull our nation out of its foreign troubles and lead We the People out of our domestic emergencies appealed to a broad cross-section of Americans, sweeping him into office. Don’t believe me? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election\">He won Indiana in 2008</a>.</p><p>What did personal performance and optimistic vision allow both Reagan and Obama to achieve? They built coalitions of voters who otherwise had little in common, racially, demographically or geographically. Their elections were turning points in American political history.</p><p>Both the Republican and Democratic parties have become so illiberal that unaffiliated voters have little to draw them in. As Max Hastings notes in his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vietnam-Tragedy-1945-1975-Max-Hastings/dp/0062405667\">towering work on Vietnam</a>, neither party gives Americans anything to “join up to.” It is only because the two-party system allows so little choice or competition that voters consistently vote for the candidate they dislike least.</p><p>American voters may be currently unhappy, but they are still open-minded. If Democrats decide to continue on their current track, lacking vision, optimism or any coherent alternative to a president who is clearly unfit for the job, they’ll have only themselves to blame.

And while election season once signified a ramping up of vitriolic rhetoric aimed at opponents and the other political party, the American public is now exposed to a constant stream of hateful diatribes, mostly thanks to President Trump’s tweets. What remains to be seen in this election season is whether the majority of the voting public is weary of the vitriol and ready to gravitate toward more calm, compassionate and thoughtful candidates, or if they’ll continue to line up behind those intent on baiting their followers with fear-based, hate-inducing “us vs. them” messages.<br><br>The ratcheting up of our country’s political divides is reaching a crescendo. It’s fed by a bifurcated media that provides us with the information we want to hear -- even if it’s not based in fact. The impact of such divergent points of view has led to a societal “psycho-sclerosis,” or a “hardening of the attitudes,” which not only accelerates righteousness, but depicts those who believe otherwise as “the enemy.”<br><br>It’s understandable to criticize the candidates themselves, whether it’s their policies or their character. They’ve chosen to put themselves out into the “political marketplace,” and being judged is a part of that process. However, it’s something else entirely when we make the mistake of assuming that somebody who votes for a candidate necessarily agrees with everything that candidate does. In a binary voting system, many people may be voting for the candidate they least dislike, as opposed to one they like.<br><br>We are, by our nature as humans, resistant to alternative approaches to our firmly held beliefs. We tend to unconsciously jump to conclusions based on ideological points of view. Hidden prejudices and biases are surprisingly influential underpinnings to all our beliefs -- affecting our feelings, the judgments we make about others and, consequently, our actions. While it’s been our belief that stereotypes and biases were the purview of bigoted people, an explosion of studies about the unconscious reveal an uncomfortable truth that all people use biases and stereotypes all of the time.<br><br>We’re made to think that we can talk people out of their point of view if we give them the right evidence. But political biases actually distort our ability to reason logically. A study out of Dartmouth College found that when voters are misinformed, factual information only makes them more rigid in their point of view.<br><br>With unconscious biases driving our perceptions, and political rhetoric and a flood of information fueling our animosity, the level of societal incivility continues to heighten. How can we break out of the rancor and hostility and find unity as a country -- or at least more understanding and civility?<br><br>To begin this effort, we first need to recognize and address our own biases. Our personal biases are formed from past experiences and cultural norms and tend to reside in our unconsciousness -- and, at times, are completely inconsistent with our conscious values. Still, these biases often can be reckoned with simply by noticing them.<br><br>Here are some ways to make the unconscious conscious:<br><br><strong>1. Recognize that bias is a normal part of the human experience.</strong> Bias is part of our fundamental survival mechanism. When we understand this, it allows us to bring compassion to others and to ourselves for our blind spots. It also means that we need to discard the good person/bad person paradigm and recognize the humanity in each of us. It’s also important to realize that some groups of people have suffered a great deal more at a societal level because of the institutionalized systems of bias negatively affecting groups such as people of color, women, LGBTQ people, people with disabilities, and others. At the same time, such realization doesn’t keep us from facing and working on our own issues. Remove any self-criticism about biases and take on the task of self-exploration. It can be a very illuminating experience.<br><br><strong>2. Pay close attention to gut reactions.</strong> If you pay attention, you can sense when you’re reacting from an earlier emotional place. Even if you can’t recall an incident or know what you’re triggering, the very fact of sensing that you’re reacting to something from the past can help you “dis-identify” with the reaction and allow you to choose a different behavior. For example, if you bristle when asked to hurry up, the emotion may correlate with conflicts you had with your parents as a child when you were running late. Pay particular attention to the way your reactions show up physically in your body. Realize “if you’re hysterical, it’s likely historical.”<br><br><strong>3. Shift into neutral.</strong> What you can do to deal with bias is somewhat similar to what you do when you shift into neutral in a car. When you shift into neutral, the engine doesn’t stop running, but for that moment at least, the engine isn’t driving the car. The same is true when you bring your awareness to your bias. The bias may still be there, but at that moment you have some ability to manage how much it controls your behavior. We are a culture that moves quickly to “doing,” but it’s important to recognize the importance of “being” and developing awareness as a source of transformation.<br><br><strong>4. Seek different perspectives.</strong> One of the most effective ways to dis-identify with our biases is through exposure to people and groups we harbor biases against. The bottom line is, the more we get to know people for who they are, the less we treat them like what they are (or at least what they appear as to us).<br><br>Ultimately, the motivator for learning to navigate our unconscious biases comes down to allowing more healthy interactions between people and more equity throughout our society. Who we are and who we want to be as a society will ultimately be defined by our ability to raise our consciousness level beyond our tendency to simply react from biases.<br></p>","name":"In the Upcoming Presidential Election, Can We Stop Demonizing “The Other”?","slug":"in-the-upcoming-presidential-election-can-we-stop-demonizing-the-other","hero":{"fileId":"5d8259bc61bd7d5587727ac4","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d8259bc61bd7d5587727ac4_RTX28SP3-1024x705.jpg","alt":null},"topics-new":"5d0d0dfb2be7835ae576a5cc","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","updated-on":"2020-07-31T02:43:55.117Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","created-on":"2019-09-18T16:21:35.074Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-07-31T17:34:59.536Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","author-s":["5d82667c95123a44fb7dc07a"],"sticky":false,"teaser":"With unconscious biases driving our perceptions, and political rhetoric and a flood on information fueling our animosity, the level of societal incivility continues to heighten.

Times Op Ed tucked under the Times’ Politics vertical suggests that an L.A. Times poll indicates that, “Democrats are missing an opportunity to brand Trump as too conservative.”<br></p><p>Why’s that, according to David Lautner, the Times’ Washington Bureau Chief?<br></p><p>Because the poll finds that most Americans, including Independent voters and even Democratic voters, view President Donald Trump as a rather moderate president. (Interestingly it is only Republicans voters who consider Trump conservative, via the results of this survey.)<br></p><p>Meanwhile, Lautner sees some ways to brand Trump as too conservative to be reelected president in 2020:<br></p><p>“But in office, Trump has aligned himself firmly with his party’s right wing. His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was a leading tea party member of Congress, one of numerous top officials who would have been deemed too conservative for past Republican administrations. Trump has pursued efforts to repeal and undermine the Affordable Care Act, toed the National Rifle Assn. line on guns and reversed a host of environmental rules, some of which were first adopted under the George H.W. and George W. Bush administrations.”<br></p><p>Think about how perverse Lautner’s line of reasoning is. If Independent voters and Democrats view Donald Trump as relatively moderate, then he reasons the Democrats must not be doing a good enough job of convincing the electorate that he’s really too conservative. This is typical of the optics-obsessed political and journalistic establishment of our day that believes it can influence and control the way voters perceive political and social realities, rather than actually listening to the voters and taking their worldview seriously.<br></p><p>It’s this mistaken belief -- hopelessly antiquated in the Information Era and the era of the discerning consumer and voter -- in the power of manipulation, that blindsided the political and media establishment with the spectacularly surprising ascension of Trump to the White House in 2016. And it seems politicos still have not learned their lesson. What makes this L.A. Times piece all the more gruesome is how weak a case it makes to bolster this image of Donald Trump as some sort of far-right conservative in the paragraph quoted above.<br></p><p>The case for “too conservative” Lautner makes is a rather paltry smattering of policy trifles that reveal the journalistic establishment’s own miscalibrated sense of the liberal-to-conservative spectrum. Even in saying that Mick Mulvaney “would have been deemed” too conservative, the author reverts to the flimsy line of optics-as-reality thinking. Would he have? By whom and how many people? And would they have been right in so deeming, or would it have been partisan bluster from party and media operatives out of touch with most moderate and independent voters?<br></p><p>Did opposing federal gun control policies and “ObamaCare” really make Mulvaney too conservative for most Americans? Then why did Republicans gain 63 seats in the U.S. House (the largest swing to either party since 1948), and 7 seats in the U.S. Senate in the 2010 midterms, the year Mulvaney was first elected to Congress? Maybe because in reality gun control and the Affordable Care Act were too liberal for most Americans. </p><p>Trying to pin Trump down as “too conservative” for his efforts to repeal the ACA ignores the historical fact that it was the most partisan federal health care reform in U.S. history. The final version of ObamaCare passed into law <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Obamacare_overview#Congressional_passage\">without a single</a> Republican vote. Then a few months later voters handed Democrats the worst defeat suffered by either party in Congress in over half a century.<br></p><p>And trying to paint Donald Trump as \"too conservative\" on gun policy will also likely miss the mark for Democrats in 2020. Because the reality is, Donald Trump’s gun policies have been somewhere to the left of his predecessor’s. The only two gun laws signed by Barack Obama as president, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/obama-gun-laws-passed-by-congress-3367595\">actually expanded</a> gun rights (to carry firearms in National Parks and in Amtrak-checked baggage). Trump on the other hand, has actually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/trump-bump-stocks-ban.html\">placed restrictions</a> on firearms as president, banning bump stocks last December.<br></p><p>Instead of trying to manipulate voters into thinking something they clearly don’t think is true -- that Donald Trump is too conservative -- Democrats would do better to advance a candidate that’s not too liberal, someone who stands a chance of appealing to the independent voters that flipped the entire election to Donald Trump in 2016. Instead, the Party of Jefferson is advancing an entire crop of candidates with extreme left reform agendas. </p><p>The full-blown socialism of so many of this election season’s candidates will not play well with the broadest cross-section of American voters. They could probably run Mitt Romney this time around and have a better chance at winning.<br></p>","name":"OPINION: Democrats Are Killing Their Chances With Independent Voters","teaser":"Instead of trying to manipulate voters into thinking something they clearly don’t think is true -- that Donald Trump is too conservative -- Democrats would do better to advance a candidate that’s not too liberal.","topics":[],"slug":"opinion-democrats-are-killing-their-chances-with-independent-voters","hero":{"fileId":"5d813379a38c8c8186007fee","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d813379a38c8c8186007fee_Dems.jpg","alt":null},"network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","topics-new":"5d0d0dfb2be7835ae576a5cc","author-s":["5d112fa1c8778d108da5fd18"],"updated-on":"2020-07-31T02:43:32.434Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","created-on":"2019-09-17T19:45:51.294Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-07-31T17:34:59.536Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5d8137ef414f210159f8208e"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"publish-date":"2019-09-17T02:29:00.000Z","body":"<p>Four state Republican Parties -- Arizona, Kansas, Nevada, and South Carolina -- have decided to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/06/republicans-cancel-primaries-trump-challengers-1483126\">cancel their presidential primary or caucus for the 2020 election</a>, denying even their own members a choice in the 2020 race.</p><p>It is not uncommon for a party to cancel primaries when they have a sitting president running unopposed.

He lives in Arizona, I live in New York. More often than not, our conversations turn to sports. We love and play golf (he’s 92!), we watch football, the Yankees! (He grew up in the Bronx in the 30’s and 40’s) and tennis.<br><br>Naturally, tennis was a big topic this past Sunday morning. The Serena/Bianca match a day earlier had ended with Serena denied (denying herself?) a 24th Grand Slam final win. The men’s singles showdown at the U.S. Open between Rafael Nadal and Daniil Medvedev was set to start in a matter of hours.<br><br>“Medvedev is young and he can be cunning,” my dad said. “This could go to five sets.”<br><br>Though it had been many decades since I’d watched an episode of “Father Knows Best,” I settled in for the match expecting a long and arduous contest. Father did know best, as it turned out, and the many predictions of an instant and crushing win by Rafi did not materialize. Instead, the match lasted five hours, going five sets all the way to the edge before Nadal finally put it away to win his 19th Grand Slam title. He collapsed in tears after the final point.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d791d6f4b41172a105da49c_nadal%20med%203.jpg\"></div></figure><p>During the match, the New York crowd in the stadium had cheered for the 33-year-old Nadal, then for the Russian upstart 10 years his junior, and then for Nadal again as he fought to break Medvedev’s serve and win the match. Medvedev gave a classy finalist speech with credit to Rafi, to his team, and to the crowd — with whom he’d had a tumultuous relationship in the weeks of play leading up to the finals. Some “bad behavior” had turned the crowd against him, though in the finals against Nadal he won their respect, even their love. “I can also change, I’m a human being,” he told them at the awards ceremony. “I can make mistakes. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.”<br><br>Later that evening, after my own spectator adrenaline had stopped pumping, I allowed myself to reflect on the match and on Medvedev’s speech. With all the huge amounts of money, the giant scale of the sports industry, its inherent biases, the disrespect too often shown to players by team owners, the pay inequities, and the like, it was still the case that in sports, performance — actual, unadorned, gut-wrenching performance — mattered.<br><br>How few things in mass culture are like that. Certainly, politics in America is nothing like that. In the political game, when are you allowed to admit mistakes? When are you subject to rules that you or your allies did not write? Where are you encouraged to show your true and best self? The corruption of political life — of governance, of elections, of policy-making, of the spin on governance, elections and policy making — is so pervasive and so damaging. Soul crushing is a term that comes to mind.<br><br>It was funny to reflect on the Nadal/Medvedev match and how the crowd’s alignments shifted—first to the relentless champion, then to the brilliant challenger, then back to the champion. This passionate human behavior is a mystery to most political pollsters and analysts, who want to explain their world by asking “Who do you plan to vote for?” Or “Who’s position on immigration do you support?”. Sadly, these are the metrics used to shape the fate of the nation. In the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the crowd loved two extraordinary competing athletes and they were able to give their appreciation to one, then the other, then to both at different moments in the drama unfolding on the court. Poll that phenomenon, if you can!<br><br>The corruption of American politics is deep and stifling and it is producing levels of alienation and antagonism that are frightening. It is prohibited to break out of that modality. That’s one reason that when Marianne Williamson raised the question in the last Democratic Primary debate as to whether and how the Democrats intended to offer a vision, not a program, to rally the American people and defeat Trump, she got more Google hits by a wide margin of any candidate but did not rise in the polls.

Here is a quick recap.</p><p data-w-id=\"856a1c56-3321-c5a0-f0c2-83f956508d94\">Both chambers of the Maine legislature <a data-w-id=\"80ea0d53-8dde-2f16-96fc-8f503f9a0e09\" href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/maine-legislature-passes-ranked-choice-voting-for-presidential-elections\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">approved &nbsp;LD 1083</a> by overwhelming majorities in June. However, because of a last minute procedural maneuver, the bill was sent back to the State Senate instead of going to Mills' desk. .</p><p data-w-id=\"f9f22ad6-c4e7-943d-523f-6aed9ae293d0\">The Maine State Senate <a data-w-id=\"91c40b7b-905d-9f29-3cc6-007e74d2deb3\" href=\"https://ivn.us/posts/breaking-ranked-choice-voting-for-presidential-elections-headed-to-maine-governors-desk\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">took the bill up again</a> during the special legislative session on August 26, and once again approved RCV's expansion to presidential elections in a 20-12 vote. This gave Governor Janet Mills a 10-day deadline to sign the bill.</p><p data-w-id=\"212ce4a0-05d7-6956-d504-c989d37206a0\">Gov. Mills had 3 options: She could have vetoed the bill, signed the bill, or she could have done nothing and the bill would automatically be enacted after 11:59 PM Friday, September 6. Mills signature would have guaranteed RCV's use in the March 2020 presidential primaries. However, since she chose not to take any action on the bill, it won't likely be used until the November election.</p><p data-w-id=\"0dbc26d3-cb8d-85a1-fe71-62715b0e015c\">“Governor Mills could have signed LD 1083 into law, but instead chose to hold the bill, thus Maine voters are unlikely to be able to rank their choices in the crowded March primary,” said David Farmer, a spokesperson for The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting. “With an unprecedented number of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination, voters could be forced to pick just one and that’s too bad. However, RCV will be used in next November’s presidential election and in future primaries and general elections for President moving forward.”</p><p data-w-id=\"2592563e-376f-4998-f15c-9d785d44304a\">Still, the bill marks another major victory for RCV&nbsp;advocates going into the 2020 elections, and another historic reform achievement in Maine.</p><p data-w-id=\"dcd572a1-a63f-422a-43a9-32e70ceb3e49\">“RCV is a groundbreaking structural reform that is key to fixing our broken political system and transforming American politics,” said Dick Woodbury, lead petitioner of Maine’s original ranked-choice voting law.</p>","name":"It's Official: Maine Makes History Again with Ranked Choice Voting","hero":{"fileId":"5d72dd7a6ba7c769443acc1c","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c9122ca5f4904b8a2728554/5d72dd7a6ba7c769443acc1c_Maine_Building.jpg","alt":null},"slug":"its-official-maine-makes-history-again-with-ranked-choice-voting","network":"5c9124b81ad86f2f56b52215","author-s":["5c9154810b45a06d18e61af3"],"topics-new":"5d23a0ad1788ac673429da11","updated-on":"2020-07-31T02:42:18.253Z","updated-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","created-on":"2019-09-06T22:28:20.497Z","created-by":"Collaborator_5d09682806d04c6b7810a250","published-on":"2020-07-31T17:34:59.536Z","published-by":"Collaborator_5d4330eed5bffdee4723e810","teaser":"Maine is now officially the first state to adopt ranked choice voting for presidential elections.","sticky":false,"franchise-2":["5f21ad17d5609a0133340368"],"_cid":"5c9127dc8de2c93b785f8e8c","_id":"5d72dd846e4f2b649c2161f7"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"sticky":false,"publish-date":"2019-08-06T05:44:00.000Z","featured":true,"body":"<p><em>Update 8/20/19: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nesse </em><a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/08/michigan-attorney-general-asks-federal-court-to-drop-gop-redistricting-lawsuit.html\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\"><em>filed a brief in federal court</em></a><em> on Monday, August 19, asking the judge to drop a lawsuit filed by 15 Republican politicians, lobbyists, and residents over a voter-approved citizens’ redistricting commission on which they are ineligible to serve.
