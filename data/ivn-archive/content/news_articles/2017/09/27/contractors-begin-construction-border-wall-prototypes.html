<p>Ground is being moved in Otay Mesa for six contractors selected to begin the process of building eight prototypes for the new border wall.</p>

<p>Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says four of the prototypes will be concrete, while the other four will be made of "<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-awards-contracts-other-materials-border-wall-prototypes" rel="noopener noreferrer">other materials</a>." If you listen to the rhetoric of President Trump, there is a high probability those other materials would include some kind of plastic for a solar presentation.</p>

<p>Ronald Vitiello, CBP's acting deputy commissioner <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/construction-begins-wall-prototypes" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent out a statement</a>&nbsp;that read in part:</p>
<p><em>"We are committed to securing our border and that includes constructing border walls. Our multi-pronged strategy to ensure the safety and security of the American people includes barriers, infrastructure, technology and people. Moving forward with the prototype enables us to continue to incorporate all the tools necessary to secure our border."</em></p>

<p>CBP said all eight prototypes will be between 18-30 feet high and designed to deter illegal crossings.</p>

<p>The contractors have 30 days to complete the prototypes, at which time the Department of Homeland Security will examine them and make a selection. DHS will pay for the prototypes, each of which is reported to cost around $500,000.</p>

<p><strong>PROTESTS EXPECTED</strong></p>

<p>Certainly this campaign promise of President Trump's has not gone without protest.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/sd-me-border-begins-20170926-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Union-Tribune</a> reports, "A free speech area has been established for protestors. It's and area overlooking Otay Mesa and more than 1.5 miles away from construction."</p>

<p>Although the initial day of construction produced no protestors, at least one local activist group, Alliance San Diego, questioned whether the project was even worth protesting at this time.</p>

<p>Spokesman for Alliance San Diego Hiram Soto told IVN San Diego,&nbsp;"This is simply political theater. There is no funding for the border wall in Congress. What's really important is to make sure Congress passes the Dream Act without adding additional border enforcement such as hiring more Border Patrol agents that further militarize our communities."</p>
