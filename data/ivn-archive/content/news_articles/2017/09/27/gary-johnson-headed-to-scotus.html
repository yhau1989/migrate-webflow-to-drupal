<p>Focusing on whether a football player takes a knee or the president chooses to tweet about it misses a point.</p>

<p>Our country is absorbed in partisan controversy, and the media plays right along.</p>

<p>Kneel to fight for social justice? That's freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Stand to recognize the people who have given their lives to keep us safe? That's freedom of speech.</p>

<p>But what about free speech during the most important political dialogue between candidates and the American people ... the presidential debates?</p>

<p>For nearly five years, my legal team and I have been at the front of&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2017/09/06/johnson-stein-debate-lawsuit-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an anti-trust lawsuit</a> against the&nbsp;<a href="/tag/commission-on-presidential-debates" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> (CPD). What few Americans know is that the CPD is actually a partnership between the Democratic and Republican Parties, and that is why despite 76% of voters wanting to hear a third voice in the 2016 debates, the rules were designed to exclude candidates like myself.</p>

<p>Read my original 2012 complaint <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/gary-johnson-files-anti-trust-lawsuit-to-get-into?utm_term=.fiNMyyPga#.rmKbXXmKR" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>But this case is not about me. The CPD has been excluding independent and third-party voices from the presidential debates for two decades.</p>

<p>That's why, one month from now, I will be on the steps of the Supreme Court, calling for the justices to put an end to the Republican-Democratic monopoly that controls the presidential debates every four years.</p>

<p>Football players have First Amendment rights, and every right to exercise them. The president has every right to tweet.</p>

<p>But one thing is clear: there should be at least as much opportunity for free speech at the presidential debates as there is at a football game.</p>

<p>Imagine the substance we could talk about!</p>

<p>Criminal justice reform. <a href="/tag/marijuana" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drug laws</a>. <a href="https://ivn.us/category/foreign-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foreign policy</a>. Real <a href="/tag/immigration" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigration reform</a>.</p>

<p>All of these issues get stuck in a two-sided conversation meant to divide us.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="One thing is clear: there should be at least as much opportunity for free speech at the presidential debates as there is at a football game." author="Gov. Gary Johnson"]

<p>So, while the “taking a knee” war rages on Twitter and the football field, North Korea is literally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/north-koreas-foreign-minister-says-trump-has-declared-war-on-country" rel="noopener noreferrer">declaring war</a>, the U.S. Senate is once again failing to do anything about a health care catastrophe, and millions of American citizens in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/us/puerto-rico-maria-recovery/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/25/virgin-islands-bracing-for-long-recovery-after-one-two-punch-from-irma-maria.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virgin Islands</a> are dealing with natural disasters of historic proportion.</p>

<p>This week is a perfect demonstration of the fact that the politics of division are simply too tempting when two worn-out parties control the conversation and exclude everyone else.</p>

<p>Americans get it. We know what our priorities should be. But the Commission on Presidential Debates won’t let anyone on the stage who might offer a different approach. That’s why I am going to Washington, DC on October 26.</p>
