<p><strong>SENATE PASSES FISCAL PACKAGE, HEADS TO THE HOUSE</strong></p>

<p>In a much discussed move by President Trump, the Senate, led by Demorcrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer reached an agreement on funding the government for three more months and providing billions of dollars in relief for Hurricane Harvey victims.</p>

<p>The president also noted he was open to&nbsp;eliminating the need&nbsp;for Congress to hold votes on raising the country’s borrowing limit.</p>

<p>After the deal was struck, the president was asked if this signals a new era in Washington, Trump replied, “I think it does, yes. I think we will have a different relationship than we’ve been watching over the last number of years. The people of the United States really want to see a coming together, at least to an extent.”</p>

<p>Many <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/06/politics/trump-meeting-with-democrats-deal/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans were "shell shocked"</a>&nbsp;after the deal was cut. Democrats hailed the move. The debt ceiling bill <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/07/house-hurricane-harvey-debt-limit-package-mnuchin-mick-mulvaney-242454" rel="noopener noreferrer">moves to the house</a> where it is expected to be passed.</p>

<p><strong>BIG MONEY AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/2017/09/07/breaking-unholy-alliance-big-money-mainstream-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a story on IVN</a>, the remarkable connection between money and the media. Did you know only&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T" rel="noopener noreferrer">six large corporations</a>&nbsp;own over 90% of all news media, while all independent media compete for the last 10% of the market.</p>

<p>As author Viktor Lidholt notes, "The mainstream media will never address these issues themselves. So, what can we, as news readers, do to fix it? What we have to do is to redefine what is mainstream. We need to create our own news source. A news source that is controlled by real, ordinary people. When we grow it large enough, this will become the new mainstream.</p>

<p>It has never been more important to do this than it is now. If we want real change, we will not just have to replace the people in power, we will also need to fix the news."</p>

<p><strong>HURRICANE IRMA</strong></p>

<p>The images that are being broadcast following the path of destruction of Hurricane Irma are truly revealing catastropic damage.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/07/11/43FCB37F00000578-4861184-Boats_piled_up_as_the_eye_of_Hurricane_Irma_passed_over_Tortola_-a-4_1504778890915.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tortola in the British Virgin Islands</a>, to the island of <a href="http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/59b1631c45e2381e008b4bf6-1177/screen%20shot%202017-09-07%20at%20110324.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbuda being 90% destroyed</a>, Irma will go down as the most powerful and likely destructive hurricane in history.</p>

<p>And now it's setting its sights on Miami, Florida. Hurricane experts say the storm has taken a more<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/07/hurricane-watch-issued-for-south-florida-ahead-irma-governor-says-fuel-shortages-top-priority.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> west path</a>, which would lead it directly to Miami.</p>
