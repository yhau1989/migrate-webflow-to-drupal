<p>The news story that dominated the early part of the week was President Trump's decision to rescind President Obama's&nbsp;<strong>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACA</a>) executive action. The reaction to it was broadly felt across the Internet and on social media.</p>

<p>It is important to note that DACA is not dead yet. Congress has six months to act, something that IVN contributing editor Steve Peace says shouldn't be a problem, given its popularity.</p>

<p>"If Congress can't pass a statutorily sound DACA with the winds of law, politics, and morality all at their backs, it is hard to imagine Congress being able to do anything," writes Peace.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="I think you'll find a lot of people including Republicans who want to take legislative steps to prevent that from happening and preserve DACA." author="US Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.)"]

<p>Former Libertarian presidential candidate <a href="/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a> <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/09/06/gary-johnson-time-congress-right-thing-daca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">is calling on Congress</a> to protect the 800,000 DREAMers -- as they are called -- currently in the US from potential deportation.</p>

<p>"[DREAMers] deserve the opportunity to stay. Frankly, as a nation, we have an investment in them, and can only benefit if they are granted the clear legal opportunity to remain here and put their educations, skills, and ambitions to work," he&nbsp;says.</p>

<p>US Rep. <a href="/tag/scott-peters" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Peters</a> (D-Calif.) also weighed in on the matter, among other topics, in the most recent IVN podcast.</p>

<p>"I think you'll find a lot of people including Republicans who want to take legislative steps to prevent that from happening and preserve DACA," says Peters.</p>

<p>So, should Congress continue&nbsp;DACA? We&nbsp;posed the question to readers on the IVN&nbsp;Facebook Page.</p>



<p>Most respondents voted&nbsp;yes, Congress should continue the DACA program or some variant of it.</p>

<p>Still, a considerable number also said no -- approximately 1,700 of the nearly 6,000 responses. This is a testament to the diverse thought within the independent-minded community and the IVN audience.</p>

<p>Here is what some IVN readers had to say:</p>

What do you think? What should Congress do about the 800,000 DREAMers currently in the US and the DACA program?</p>
