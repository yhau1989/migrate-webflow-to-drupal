<p>On September 11th, the US remembers its fallen citizens, murdered in the worst terrorist attack since the Oklahoma City bombing.</p>

<p>In unison, they #neverforget the 3,000 people who were murdered that day. But, people have forgotten so much -- or have never known -- 16 years later, how 9/11 has effected US war, culture, and law.</p>

<p>US citizens did what its founder, Ben Franklin, warned never to do -- they exchanged freedom for security.</p>
<h2><strong>War</strong></h2>
<p>9/11 was followed by an intense national campaign to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/books/06book.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">expand</a> presidential military powers, in order to protect the US from terrorism.</p>

<p>The Iraq War, which started with an alarming pre-emptive <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shock-and-awe-throttles-iraq/" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet bombing</a>, under <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/dick-cheneys-biggest-lie-333097.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">false</a> pretenses, was one of the immediate consequences.</p>

<p>Pre-emptive war is considered illegal under international law, but became a US strategy after 9/11, threatening other countries since, like <a href="http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/peace-and-prosperity/2017/january/28/pre-emptive-attack-iran-bill-active-in-us-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iran</a> and <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/us-north-korea-war-mcmaster-646942" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>.</p>

<p>The US was infamously willing to 'go it alone' in Iraq, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/12/usa.iraq" rel="noopener noreferrer">against</a> the international community. Today, echoes of US isolationism remain, with frequent challenges to the <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/27/united-nations-donald-trump-antonio-guterres-china-215315" rel="noopener noreferrer">UN</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/12/going-alone-not-option-nato-chief-jens-stoltenberg-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">NATO</a> as legitimate factors in US policies.</p>

<p>After 9/11, the US used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/us-practiced-torture-after-9-11-nonpartisan-review-concludes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">torture</a>, and unmanned <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/08/493004533/the-rise-of-the-drone-and-the-thorny-questions-that-have-followed" rel="noopener noreferrer">drones</a>, under seemingly endless executive military power.</p>

<p>These tactics plague the US's image, and erode the nation's&nbsp;moral authority around the globe.</p>

<p>Collectively, changes in ways in which the US runs its war efforts after September 11th have greatly expanded executive powers to unilaterally and aggressively carry out its military agenda, under a constant impending threat of terrorism.</p>

<p>Civilian deaths in the US's wars on terror have ballooned to over 1 million, according to a <a href="http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/body-count.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> authored in partnership with Physicians for Social Responsibility, and show no <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/trumps-policy-is-clear-civilian-casualties-dont-matter-in-the-war-on-terror/" rel="noopener noreferrer">signs</a> of stopping.</p>
<h2><strong>Laws</strong></h2>
<p>Several post 9/11 laws have enabled the executive branch to not only target foreigners with overarching new powers, but also the American people.</p>

<p>Since 2001, laws authorized under the National Defense Authorization Act (<a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2011/12/21/the-national-defense-authorization-act-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer">NDAA</a>), specifically the Authorization for Use of Military Force (<a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/senators-table-paul-amendment-2018-ndaa" rel="noopener noreferrer">AUMF</a>), have&nbsp;given the executive branch its expanded military powers to target anyone or anything it can connect to 'terrorism.'</p>

<p><a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2011/12/21/the-national-defense-authorization-act-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subtitle D</a> of the NDAA allows for indefinite detention of US citizens suspected of connections with terrorism, without due process.</p>

<p>The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (<a href="https://ivn.us/2015/05/29/courts-civil-liberty-groups-agree-congress-must-reform-patriot-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Patriot Act</a>), passed with remarkable speed after 9/11. It gave the executive branch its confidence to use <a href="https://ivn.us/2015/02/19/civil-rights-groups-fight-nsa-spying/" rel="noopener noreferrer">broad powers</a> to interpret who or what might be <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/student-privacy-and-patriot-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer">labeled</a> a 'terrorist,' foreign or domestic.</p>

<p>The Patriot Act is aided by the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/summary" rel="noopener noreferrer">FISA Amendment Act</a> of 2008, which gave immunity to companies that comply with government requests for the people's information.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/questions-answers-newly-approved-usa-freedom-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The USA Freedom Act</a>, passed in 2015, reined in some of the abuses, but there is still a long way to go to restore legal integrity of US citizens' constitutional rights, according to civil liberty groups like the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/usa-freedom-act-passes-what-we-celebrate-what-we-mourn-and-where-we-go-here" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFF</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/whats-next-surveillance-reform-after-usa-freedom-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACLU</a>.</p>

<p>Laws enacted as emergency responses to 9/11 have significantly eroded First&nbsp;and Fourth&nbsp;Amendment rights to free speech, freedom of association, privacy, and due process.</p>
<h2><strong>Culture</strong></h2>
<p>None of these changes could have taken place without a significant change in culture.</p>

<p>Fear was not just a natural phenomenon, as a response to the unimaginable sight of the Twin Towers cascading in free fall in the middle of New York City. It was sustained by the Bush Administration, which <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/silencing-voices-of-dissent/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vilified dissent</a>, reminded US citizens of their insecurity <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32501273/ns/us_news-security/t/ridge-says-he-was-pressured-raise-terror-alert/" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily</a>, and instituted a <a href="https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1952663261/terrorism-and-super-patriotism" rel="noopener noreferrer">super-patriotism</a> that pulses through America still.</p>

<p>"If you're not with us, you're against us" became America's new slogan. It did not only apply to foreigners, it applied to <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V121/N50/col50gregd.50c.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">anyone who criticized</a> the Bush administration, and specifically, the War on Terror.</p>

<p>Those who criticized the Bush administration were increasing called 'un-American' and 'with the terrorists,' climaxing in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bachmann-calls-for-penetrating-expose-on-anti-americans-in-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michele Bachmann's</a> calls, in 2008, for an inquiry into 'liberal' Congress members who might hold 'un-American' views.</p>

<p>If you were politically aware around 2001, you might remember American flags everywhere, from the new Fox&nbsp;News <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/roger-ailes-architect-of-conservative-tv-juggernaut-fox-is-dead-at-77-20170518.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">logo</a>, to its ubiquitous use in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/26/business/media-business-advertising-patriotic-themes-reappear-but-with-more-subtlety-than.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">advertising</a>. It was the visual precursor to the chants of "USA! USA!" we hear in populist crowds all over the country.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/islamophobia-why-muslims-experience-greatest-economic-disadvantage-1008062151" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muslims</a> have taken the brunt of abuses from overarching government authority; and shifting cultural views of what it means to be American, and who the 'enemy' is.</p>

<p>Widespread acceptance of Islamaphobia made it easy to target others -- liberals, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-responds-to-petition-to-label-black-lives-matter-a-terror-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-joe-arpaio-20170826-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigrants</a>, and yes, this game has circled back to target <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/magazine/how-un-american-became-the-political-insult-of-the-moment.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">conservatives</a>.</p>

<p>It's no wonder that Americans of all sorts feel threatened, and need protection against some 'enemy.'</p>

<p>But, who is the 'enemy'? Islamic terrorists who "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">hate freedom,</a>" or fellow citizens <a href="https://hub.wsu.edu/law-justice-realtime/2015/12/17/islamophobia-the-stereotyping-and-prejudice-towards-muslims-since-911/" rel="noopener noreferrer">willing to sacrifice</a> each other's freedoms for "protection"?</p>

<p>Whose freedoms are being sacrificed? Protection against what? The answers are not clear.</p>
<h2><strong>A Nation of Fear</strong></h2>
<p>Immediately after 9/11, 60% of Americans in a <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/19/americans-feel-the-tensions-between-privacy-and-security-concerns/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research poll</a> were OK with trading civil liberties for security, under the threat of terrorism. That number bounces up and down depending on how fearful the public is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/19/americans-feel-the-tensions-between-privacy-and-security-concerns/ft_16-02-09_concerns_security2/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Public's shifting concerns on security and civil liberties" height="409" src="cloudinary://FT_16.02.09_concerns_security2.png" width="310"></a></p>
<p>America has been a culture of fear since 9/11. In such a whirlwind -- trying to protect itself against an always imminent, un-American terror -- that delineating 'who is&nbsp;<em>us</em> and who is&nbsp;<em>them,'</em> and 'what is <em>American,</em>' has proved illusive.</p>

<p>If you question how we got here, answers can be found by reflecting on how September 11, 2001 changed US war, laws, and culture.</p>
