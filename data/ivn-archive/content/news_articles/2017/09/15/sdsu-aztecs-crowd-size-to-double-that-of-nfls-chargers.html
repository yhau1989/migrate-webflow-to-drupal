<p>It's shaping up to be a big weekend for San Diego State University's football team.</p>

<p>The Aztecs host&nbsp;the #19 Stanford Cardinal Saturday night at the stadium formerly known as Qualcomm. The crowd is estimated to be larger than 50,000 as the Aztecs are off to a 2-0 start and the Pac-12 is sending one of their better teams south.</p>

<p>It's also the first opportunity for big-stage football since the San Diego community lost their NFL team.</p>

<p>In a<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/aztecs/sd-sp-azfoot-attendance-for-stanford-0913-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> San Diego Union-Tribune</a> story, SDSU's executive associate AD Steve Schnall was quoted, "There’s definitely a lot of buzz coming into this game."</p>

<p>The LA Chargers, the team that left a community after 56 years of fan loyalty to follow the money to Los Angeles, will likely play before a crowd of no more than 25,000 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California on Sunday. Forbes outlined the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davecaldwell/2017/09/13/theyre-charging-way-too-much-for-the-nfl-at-a-soccer-stadium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggles the team</a> is having in filling their new home.</p>

<p>For SDSU, it provides a golden opportunity to build their fan base.</p>

<p>A commercial that aired during that last Monday Night Football game that featured the LA Chargers vs. the Denver Broncos, illustrates the university's effort to win over wounded Chargers fans.</p>

<p>San Diego State is also developing site plans for a campus expansion and new stadium on the grounds where they will play Saturday night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/aztecs/sd-sp-azfoot-jd-wicker-stadium-0914-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSU Athletic Director John Wicker</a> said, "We’re looking at the right size stadium, that’s a multi-use stadium that’s right for college football but also has elements for soccer as well. We want a stadium that we have a partnership with someone on. The more events we can do in a stadium, the more successful San Diego State athletics is going to be."</p>

<p>With an expected crowd of about 50,000, the stadium would need to be larger than the current initiative to be put before voters in November 2018. That calls for a soccer stadium that would fit around&nbsp;30,000 people.</p>

<p>For the community of San Diego, Saturday provides an opportunity to heal some football wounds, and look to the future with a promising collegiate program.</p>
