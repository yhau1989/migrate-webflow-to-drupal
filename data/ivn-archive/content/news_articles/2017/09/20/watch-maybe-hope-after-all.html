<p>NowThis <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/NowThisNews/videos/" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video recently</a> of <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong>&nbsp;(BLM) protesters who showed up at the "Mother of all Rallies," a rally in support of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p>

<p>While there were some in the crowd who yelled at the BLM protesters to go away and to not give them a spotlight, the event organizer invited them on stage to speak, and what happened next shows that there is still hope in the way we speak to each other politically.</p>

<p>"It kind of restored my faith in some of those people," said Hawk Newsome, president of the New York chapter of Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>He added, "I feel like two sides that never listen to each other actually made progress."</p>
