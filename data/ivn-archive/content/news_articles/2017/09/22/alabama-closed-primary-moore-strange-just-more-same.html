<p>Alabama's closed, partisan Republican primary pits two candidates, <strong>Roy Moore</strong> and <strong>Luther Strange</strong>, that prove the value of open, nonpartisan primaries.</p>

<p>Put simply, the "I'm a bigger right-winger than you are" themed campaign is exactly what works in closed, partisan primaries. This, of course, is also true of the "I'm a bigger left-winger than you are" campaign that flourishes in closed Democratic primaries.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of US lawmakers were selected through these closed, partisan primaries. The couple of states with nonpartisan, open primaries are a very recent innovation. As a result, most of the incumbents, even in these states, are products of the old system.</p>



<p>So, it should come as no surprise that US lawmakers can't get anything done. Members of Congress understand getting re-elected if they understand nothing else.</p>
