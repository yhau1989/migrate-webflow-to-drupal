<p>Voter dissatisfaction with the Republican and Democratic Parties isn't going away. A recent Gallup poll reports that an all-time high 61 percent of respondents say both parties are doing such a bad job that a third party is needed. The number has remained relatively in the same ballpark since 2013, when it skyrocketed from 46 percent in 2012 to 60 percent.</p>

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, 77 percent of independents -- who make up a plurality of the voting population -- say Americans need a third major party. Check out the full results <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/219953/perceived-need-third-major-party-remains-high.aspx?g_source=Politics&amp;g_medium=lead&amp;g_campaign=tiles" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
