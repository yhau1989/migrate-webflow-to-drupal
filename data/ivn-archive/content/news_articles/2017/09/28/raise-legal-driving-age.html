<p>What is at the top of most teens to-do list? They can't wait to get behind the wheel. A teen must be 17 to join the military, 18 to vote or smoke, and 21 to drink, but can drive when much younger.</p>
<h2><strong>Minimum Driving Ages</strong></h2>
<p>When can a teen legally drive? Minimum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver%27s_licenses_in_the_United_States" rel="noopener noreferrer">driving ages vary from state to state</a>. Unrestricted licenses are available in all states for 18-year-olds.</p>

<p>Depending on the state, your teen might be able to:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Get a learner's permit at 14</li>
 	<li>Drive with restrictions at 16</li>
 	<li>Drive with an unrestricted "adult" license at 16</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Is 16 Too Young to Drive?</strong></h2>
<p>In most nations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_minimum_driving_age#Asia" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 is the most commonly accepted minimum age</a> for a learner's permit or provisional license. In the U.S., the debate on whether or not the average 16-year-old should have an unrestricted license resulted in the adoption of graduated licenses. These licenses typically carry a curfew on night driving, prohibit underage passengers, and require parental supervision.</p>

<p>Too often, these restrictions are ignored with deadly consequences.</p>
<h2><strong>Pros of Driving at 16</strong></h2>
<p>There are legitimate reasons for allowing teens to drive including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Getting back and forth to school, a job, and activities;</li>
 	<li>Freeing a parent from chauffeur duties; and</li>
 	<li>Learning about the responsibilities of paying for gas, insurance and car maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Cons of Driving at 16</strong></h2>
<p>The reasons for allowing teens to drive primarily concern convenience. Those in favor of raising the driving age cite safety concerns.</p>

<p>Statistics from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/teen_drivers/teendrivers_factsheet.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control</a>, the <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812278" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Transportation</a> and the <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/teenagers/fatalityfacts/teenagers" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> are revealing.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Drivers 19 and younger have a higher risk of being in a car crash than older drivers.</li>
 	<li>For every mile driven, teen drivers are three times more likely to be in a fatal accident.</li>
 	<li>Male teens are twice as likely as female teens to be in a fatal car crash.</li>
 	<li>Teen passengers increase the risk of an accident.</li>
 	<li>Maturity matters. Drivers 16-17 years old are almost twice as likely to be in an accident as 18-19 year old drivers.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Every parent must decide when their teen is ready to begin driving â€” sometimes this is earlier, and for some that comes later.</p>

<p>At the first sign of irresponsible behavior, strongly consider revoking driving privileges for a while. Putting up with a teen's unhappy behavior is better than getting the news that your child was killed or <a href="https://www.salinastriallaw.com/practice-area/auto-accident-attorney-san-antonio/" rel="noopener noreferrer">seriously injured in a car crash</a>.</p>
