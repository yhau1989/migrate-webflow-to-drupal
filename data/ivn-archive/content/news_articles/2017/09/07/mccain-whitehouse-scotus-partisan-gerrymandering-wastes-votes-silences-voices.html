<p>US Senators <strong>John McCain</strong> (R-Ariz.) and <strong>Sheldon Whitehouse</strong> (D-R.I.) are joining the legal fight against partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<p>McCain and Whitehouse <a href="https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&amp;id=A3CC57F7-0ED9-4FB9-AAF3-872CBB81874B" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a joint amicus brief</a> to the Supreme Court in the case, <a href="/tag/wisconsin-redistricting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gill v. Whitford</em></a> -- the first case in which a federal court ruled electoral districts unconstitutional not on the basis of race, gender, or socioeconomic class, but because of political discrimination.</p>

<p>In this case,&nbsp;the court ruled that&nbsp;Wisconsin legislative districts were so partisan that they violated the voting rights of those outside the Republican Party, the party that currently controls the state legislature and the redistricting process.</p>

<p>Of note, <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=94638" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 briefs</a> have been filed in Gill v Whitford against extreme partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<p>“Americans do not like gerrymandering,” McCain and Whitehouse write.</p>
<p><em>“They see its mischief, and absent a legal remedy, their sense of powerlessness and discouragement has increased, deepening the crisis of confidence in our democracy.&nbsp;We share this perspective.&nbsp;From our vantage point, we see wasted votes and silenced voices.&nbsp;We see hidden power.&nbsp;And we see a correctable problem.”</em></p>
<p><em>Gill v. Whitford</em>, which is scheduled to be heard on October 3, forces the high court to&nbsp;revisit a 2004 decision in&nbsp;<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/541/267/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vieth v. Jubelirer</em></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>in<i>&nbsp;</i>which the justices ruled that there was no measurable standard the court&nbsp;could&nbsp;use to determine what constitutes "too partisan" in legislative redistricting.</p>

<p>Without established Supreme Court precedent, federal courts have&nbsp;been reluctant to take up gerrymandering cases that don't deal with racial or socioeconomic discrimination.</p>

<p>"The increase in partisan gerrymandering following&nbsp;<i>Vieth</i>, fueled by dark money contributions and advanced technology, distorts our representative democracy and pollutes Americans’ faith in their political institutions,” McCain and Whitehouse write.</p>

<p>They add, “As Republicans and Democrats battle each other to control redistricting, the real losers are the American people.”</p>

<p>The situation, however, has&nbsp;changed as plaintiffs and redistricting reformers&nbsp;are using statistical models like the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/26/efficiency-gap-greatest-weapon-fight-partisan-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">efficiency gap</a> to establish a measurable standard to show how extreme partisan gerrymandering has become.</p>

<p><em>Gill v. Whitford</em> has changed the legal and judicial paradigm, potentially opening the door for future challenges to partisan gerrymandering across the country, and an end to the two-party scheme.</p>
