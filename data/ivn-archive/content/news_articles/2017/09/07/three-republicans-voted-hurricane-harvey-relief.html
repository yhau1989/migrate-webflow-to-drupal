<p>419-3.</p>

<p>Three Republicans voted against a bill that, in part, provides $7.85 billion in emergency financial assistance to the victims of Hurricane Harvey.</p>

<p>Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs said no to the aid package.</p>

<p>Minutes before the vote, Amash tweeted that funding for the disaster relief&nbsp;should be offset instead of being added to the deficit.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Sides with Democrats</strong></h2>
<p>It’s already been an extraordinary week in Washington.</p>

<p>President Trump sided with Democrats in making sure a short-term debt ceiling package was pushed through. The president, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, didn’t want another protracted congressional fight.</p>

<p>The real negotiating now begins in earnest as the fiscal cliff comes in December.</p>

<p><span>Democrats' reaction to the deal was joyful.</span></p>

<p><span>"Both sides have every intention of avoiding default in December and look forward to working together on the many issues before us," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi</span></p>

<p>Republicans, who don’t want to vote twice on raising the debt ceiling, were not pleased.</p>

<p>"I think our members would probably want to see something that goes significantly longer than that," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader behind Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell.</p>
