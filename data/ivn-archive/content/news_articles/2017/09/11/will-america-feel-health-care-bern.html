<p>Partly due to confusion around the health care reform plan, Americans are now seeking clarity on what is the best solution to solving the country’s health care woes.</p>

<p>US Senator <strong><a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong>&nbsp;hopes to capitalize on the moment by introducing a “political type campaign” to drive forward single-payer health care by 2020.</p>

<p>Support for universal coverage has grown in recent months. But does a “Medicare for all” type program solve America’s health care scenario?</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders seems to think so.</p>

<p>“We're going to put together a grassroots movement that organizes people in all parts of this country much like we did during the presidential race,” Sanders wrote.</p>

<p>He added, “There will be rallies, buttons, bumper stickers, shirts and most importantly people organizing in their communities across the country.”</p>

<p>Once thought to be too socialist for the mainstream, Democrats are coming together to support the single-payer plan which will also serve as a rallying cry for the Democrats’ efforts to win back one or both chambers in 2018's&nbsp;midterm elections.</p>

<p>What remains to be seen is if a single-payer system will be sustainable for taxpayers.</p>

<p>Sanders’ camp reports that American taxpayers will have to cough up $13.8 trillion over the first 10 years.</p>

<p>The nonpartisan Urban Institute disagrees with that figure, reporting that the single-payer system would cost the federal government more like $32 trillion over the first decade, requiring an average annual tax increase of $24,000 per household.</p>

<p>Regardless of the cost, 45 million Bernie Sanders supporters will undoubtedly make waves in support of the soon-to-be announced legislation.</p>

<p>Sen. Kamala Harris was one of the first Democrat to announce she'll co-sponsor Sen. Bernie Sanders' single-payer health care while vocal support for universal coverage continues to grow among other Democrats in Congress, though the party is far from united on the issue.</p>
