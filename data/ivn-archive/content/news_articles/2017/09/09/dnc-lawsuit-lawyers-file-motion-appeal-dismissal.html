searchTitle: DNC Lawsuit Lawyers File Motion to Appeal Dismissal
-->
<p>The DNC lawsuit may not be over just yet.</p>

<p>The lawyers for the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit against the DNC and Debbie Wasserman Schultz filed an intent to appeal Friday, less than a month after the lawsuit was tossed by a federal judge.</p>

<p>Very few details have been provided for the basis of the appeal. However, it was noted that one of the attorneys, Elizabeth Beck, <a href="https://disobedientmedia.com/2017/09/breaking-dnc-lawsuit-attorneys-file-notice-of-appeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously suggested</a> that the dismissal itself -- which was based partially on jurisdictional issues -- could serve as the basis for an appeal.</p>

<p>Beck mentioned in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/videos/vb.612127198950092/858192937676849/?type=2&amp;theater" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream video</a> that the appeal was rushed due to the impending arrival of Hurricane Irma to Florida, where the case was filed. No further information was given.</p>

<p>Judge Zioch, who is presiding over the case, dismissed the lawsuit&nbsp;on “technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction.” There were two main issues that led to the dismissal:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>There were plaintiffs who lived in the same states where Wasserman Schultz and the DNC are based.</li>
 	<li>The plaintiffs failed to allege any connection between the defendants’ allegedly fraudulent statements and the injury they suffered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plaintiffs in the case filed the lawsuit in June 2016 on the basis that they had given money to a campaign in the Democratic presidential primary (Bernie Sanders’ campaign) under the belief that the election process was fair.</p>

<p>Yet the DNC violated its own rules of neutrality when party officials minimized Bernie Sanders’ campaign in favor of Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>In the simplest of terms, Judge Zioch recognized that the party treated voters unfairly, but&nbsp;legal technicalities prevented the court from being able to find fault in the DNC.</p>

<p>In other words, as Beck suggests, the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, which Beck says is enough to file for an appeal.</p>
