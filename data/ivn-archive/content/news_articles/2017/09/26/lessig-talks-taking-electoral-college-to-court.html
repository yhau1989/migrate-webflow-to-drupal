-->
<p>T.J. is joined by two prominent election reform attorneys: <strong><a href="https://ivn.us/author/lawrencelessig/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence Lessig</a></strong> with <a href="https://equalcitizens.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Equal Citizens</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://ivn.us/author/chad_peace/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad Peace</a></strong> with the <a href="/tag/independent-voter-project" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Independent Voter Project</strong></a>.</p>



<p>They discuss their latest reform lawsuits and projects, breaking down each case into its ‘elevator pitch’.</p>

<p>Lawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School. He is also the founder of Equal Citizens, which recently launched Equal Votes, a legal fight against the winner-take-all method of allocating Electoral Votes in presidential elections.</p>

<p>Chad Peace is a nationally recognized leader in election law and voter rights. He serves as the attorney for the Independent Voter Project, and developed the voter outreach strategy for California’s successful nonpartisan primary initiative.</p>

<p>Most recently, he authored the City of San Diego’s Measure K, and just Friday <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/09/22/amicus-brief-judge-open-presidential-debates-matter/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed an amicus brief</a> on behalf of <a href="/tag/level-the-playing-field" rel="noopener noreferrer">Level the Playing Field</a> in the lawsuit challenging the Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
