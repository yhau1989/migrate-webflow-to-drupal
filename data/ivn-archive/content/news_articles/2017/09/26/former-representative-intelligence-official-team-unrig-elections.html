<p><em><strong>Editor's note: The following article was written by #UNRIG co-founders Robert David Steele and former US Rep. Cynthia Ann McKinney</strong></em></p>

<p>God bless <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a>. God bless <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a>. God bless the 26% that voted for <a href="/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a>, and God bless the 47% that did not vote at all.</p>

<p>Today, former US Rep. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_McKinney" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia Ann McKinney</a> and <a href="http://robertdavidsteele.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert David Steele</a>, humbly ask each of you to draw a line in the sand.</p>

<p>People, not parties. Truth, not lies. Action, not apathy.</p>

<p>We pledge to each of you, on our sacred honor, a fight to the death for unity and integrity. The time has come for every citizen to decide how we are to be governed.</p>

<p>This is what our political landscape looks like today. We both had to run for president (Cynthia in 2008, Robert in 2012) to learn that we are all prisoners to a Deep State that uses a two-party tyranny to repress — often working together — all independents and the four viable small parties (Constitution, Green, Libertarian, and Reform).</p>

<p>Emerging parties such as Justice and Working Families will never be viable under the present arrangements. The system is rigged across the board.</p>

<p>However, there is good news. Very good news.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, each in their own way, demonstrated that the two major parties that enable the Deep State are out of touch with their base, at the same time that a series of events opened many eyes to the fraudulent nature of the US secret intelligence community, mainstream media, and social media.</p>

<p>From outright lies about the <a href="/tag/russia-investigation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russians hacking the election</a>, to <a href="/tag/fake-news" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake news</a> pumped out by CNN and The New York Times, we appear to be at a turning point in US history.</p>

<p>The way is open for We the People to take back political power, ethically, non-violently, and right now!</p>

<p>We are both intimately familiar with rigged systems — Cynthia has deep knowledge of both the machinations of the secret intelligence community against members of Congress. Robert, a former spy, undertook a study of the specifics of how the US electoral system is rigged, and accumulated from across hundreds of sources, the only holistic election reform menu in existence.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3: A Holistic Approach to Election Reform – 12 Specific Possibilities</strong></p>

<p>Above is a starting point for a national conversation that must include all of us, from alt-right white guys to alt-left black ladies, and everyone in-between, and particularly including Latinos.</p>

<p>We hope that each of you will be inspired to demand of your US representative a town hall meeting on this subject, and that you will prevail on your representative to form a Congressional Election Reform Caucus ready to draft and introduce legislation, the Election Reform Act of 2017 — the Integrity Act — within the next 90 days.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4: #UNRIG Motorhome in Denver</strong></p>

<p>Above in Figure 4 is our wholly-owned, donor-funded motorhome. We have put over 9,000 miles on it, but the combination of fires across Portland and Washington and insufficient funding have stopped our campaign.</p>

<p>We want to get back on the road, but that will not be possible without a substantive increase in citizens interested in #UNRIG.</p>
