<p>In the pilot episode of IVN's&nbsp;newest <a href="https://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a>, <i>A Civil Assessment</i>, <a href="https://ivn.us/author/tjohara/" rel="noopener noreferrer">T.J. O'Hara</a> takes a look at electoral reform around the country. From measures and bills that have successfully passed,&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/09/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-celebrate-historic-victory-in-maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranked Choice Voting in Maine</a> and <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/09/measures-k-l-san-diego-city-elections-reformed-historic-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measure K in San Diego</a>, to those just introduced on the floor, like&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/17/nevada-needs-top-two-nonpartisan-election-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">top-two in Nevada</a>, T.J. breaks down how each movement aims to "de-rig" elections.</p>

<p>Republican State Senator James Settelmeyer &nbsp;<a href="http://ballot-access.org/2017/02/10/nevada-top-two-bill-introduced/" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced</a> Nevada's top-two bill <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/nevada-senator-james-settlemeyer-introduces-bill-open-primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">on</a> Tuesday, February 7. The bill, <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB103</a>, would implement a&nbsp;primary system allowing all candidates to appear on the ballot, where the top two vote-getters continue to the general election, regardless of party. <a href="https://ivn.us/search/doug+goodman" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Goodman</a>, founder of&nbsp;Nevada Election Modernization and Reform Act and author of a blog by the same name, spoke with T.J. on the podcast about the bill.</p>

<p>T.J. also interviewed&nbsp;the campaign manager for Ranked Choice Voting in Maine, <a href="https://ivn.us/search/kyle+bailey" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Bailey</a>. Kyle discussed the merits of&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/search/ranked+choice+voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranked Choice Voting</a>, or <a href="https://ivn.us/search/instant+runoff+voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instant Runoff Voting</a>, and how the citizens' initiative made it to the ballot, and passed with&nbsp;52 percent voter approval. Maine is the first state to pass&nbsp;Ranked Choice Voting, which is now facing <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/02/courts-say-ranked-choice-voting-is-constitutional/" rel="noopener noreferrer">backlash</a> from Maine's legislators.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/author/chad_peace/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad Peace</a>, an attorney for the Independent Voter Project -- authors of the nonpartisan, top-two primary&nbsp;in <a href="https://ivn.us/search/california" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a>&nbsp;-- and national advocate for election reform, discussed San Diego's Measure K, an election law that requires all citywide elections to be decided in November, when the most voters participate. Before Measure K, San Diego's local races could end in the June primary if a candidate received <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/10/12/measures-kl-san-diego-election-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 50% of the vote</a>.</p>
