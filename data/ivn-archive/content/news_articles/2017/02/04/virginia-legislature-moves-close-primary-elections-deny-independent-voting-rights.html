<div>Virginia&nbsp;has a long history of open and inclusive primary elections. But that may be about to change. State legislators&nbsp;<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+mbr+S90" rel="noopener noreferrer">John A. Cosgrove, Jr.</a>&nbsp;(R-Chesapeake)&nbsp;and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+mbr+S68" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark D. Obenshain</a>&nbsp;(R-Rockingham) are pushing complimentary bills that would&nbsp;close Virginia's taxpayer-funded primary election to voters who choose not to join a major political party.</div>
<p><a href="https://ivn.us/2013/10/22/how-do-primary-elections-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most simply, in an open primary, every voter can participate</a>. In a closed primary, only members of a major political party can participate. Open primaries tend to produce representatives that appeal to a broader base of voters. Closed primaries produce representatives that are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-closed-primaries-further-polarize-our-politics/2011/09/02/gIQARBPb2J_story.html?utm_term=.0d65a0b8dc2a" rel="noopener noreferrer">held accountable to partisans</a>.</p>

<p>This is not rocket science. When partisan voters matter, partisan voters get represented. When partisan voters are overly&nbsp;represented, we get too much&nbsp;partisanship.</p>

<p>So, at a time when politicians and political pundits&nbsp;are trying to figure out why voter turnout is dropping, why almost 50% of voters now self-identify as independent of either major party, and when almost everyone agrees that we have too much partisanship in government, what is the Virginia legislature trying to do?</p>

<p>Disenfranchise independent voters from the most important stage of the election process.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, because of rules that are designed to insulate the two parties from competition, <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/22/wisconsin-court-strikes-down-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">like gerrymandering</a>,&nbsp;90% of elections nationwide are now <a href="https://ivn.us/2013/10/25/just-35-of-435-elections-competitive-after-201-years-of-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">"decided" in the primary election</a>. Further, taxpayers are footing the bill to the tune of <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/21/taxpayers-spent-half-billion-dollars-on-party-primaries-in-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than half a BILLION dollars</a>.</p>

<p>The problem, however, for incumbent politicians and party bosses is that it is <a href="https://ivn.us/2013/11/26/why-political-parties-control-elections-and-how-to-end-partisanship/" rel="noopener noreferrer">harder for them to control the outcome</a>. Remember when pretty much everyone in the&nbsp;Republican Party was trying to stop Donald Trump? Wonder why Bernie Sanders and his supporters are so adamantly in favor of open primaries?</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/681143660705099776</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/743116367004467200</p>

<p>With a long history of holding open primaries, and under the microscope of a contentious presidential election, neither the Democratic nor the Republican Party wanted to go so far as to exclude&nbsp;nonpartisan voters from the all important Virginia primary. So instead, the RNC tried to require that&nbsp;voters sign a <a href="http://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/virginia-voters-in-gop-primary-must-sign-statement-saying-they/article_4bea8ea7-1e97-56a8-b48f-db62c80300f0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement vowing loyalty to the Republican Party</a>&nbsp;if they wanted to vote for a candidate in the Republican Party during the 2016 primary. That didn't work.</p>

<p>Now that the election is over, the Republican Party of Virginia is back at it again. Whatever you think about President Trump, you have to admit: he wasn't the guy the establishment wanted to win. And it's no secret why they wanted to close their primary last election -- to stop him.</p>

<p>So, to prevent the next anti-establishment candidate -- whether in the mold of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, or anyone else who speaks for themselves -- politicians in Virginia are collaborating&nbsp;to take away the voting rights of millions of independent-minded voters who have exercised their first amendment right not to join a political party.</p>

<p>Two bills&nbsp;introduced in the Virginia State Senate are aimed at&nbsp;closing the primaries -&nbsp;<a href="https://openstates.org/va/bills/2017/SB821/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 821</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+mbr+S90" rel="noopener noreferrer">John A. Cosgrove, Jr.</a>&nbsp;(R)) and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+SB902" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 902</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+mbr+S68" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark D. Obenshain</a>&nbsp;(R)).&nbsp;SB 821 has already been voted out of committee and would take away the right of all voters to participate in the primary.&nbsp;Instead, the political parties will decide who can and cannot vote in the taxpayer funded primary election.</p>

<p>And in&nbsp;a state that&nbsp;does not currently require voters to declare a party affiliation when they register to vote, SB 902 would require voters to indicate their party affiliation at the time they register to vote with the state.</p>

<p>If you listen to the national narrative, you'd think that the "voting rights" issue of the day is Voter ID. But after the dust of a contentious election settles, and only the partisans in the legislature and the media are still focused on politics, the Virginia legislature&nbsp;is an example of one state that might unify against a common bipartisan enemy -- independent voters.</p>
