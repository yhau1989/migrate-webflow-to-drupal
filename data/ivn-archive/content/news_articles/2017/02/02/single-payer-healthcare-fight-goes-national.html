<p>One of the more notable tenets of Bernie Sanders’ platform during his campaign for president was a “Medicare-for-all” single-payer healthcare system.</p>

<p>This was not the first time that a government-run, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_insurance_option" rel="noopener noreferrer">public option</a> has received national attention. Many may recall that the initial versions of the Affordable Care Act had included a public option, but it was voted down in the Senate finance committee and removed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/29/senate.public.option/" rel="noopener noreferrer">from the bill</a>.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="But despite the fact that neither H.R. 261, nor Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-all system came to fruition, it appears that the desire for a single-payer system persists." author=""]

<p>In 2013, House Democrats introduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/261" rel="noopener noreferrer">H.R. 261</a>, the "Public Option Deficit Reduction Act." <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/277505-house-dems-push-again-for-creation-of-government-run-health-insurance-option" rel="noopener noreferrer">The act</a> would have amended the Affordable Care Act to add a public option. It would have lowered premiums by 5-7%, which they hoped would put pressure on private insurance companies to lower <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/277505-house-dems-push-again-for-creation-of-government-run-health-insurance-option" rel="noopener noreferrer">premiums</a>. The Congressional Budget Office had estimated enacting the bill would cut the budget deficit by $104 billion over ten years. It didn’t make it out of the Subcommittee on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/265/actions" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health</a>.</p>

<p>Since that time, it appears that Americans have had varied opinions on single-payer or “Medicare-for-all” systems. Many don’t understand the concept fully, and others are turned off by the thought of paying more taxes or losing their current insurance.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/people-have-no-idea-what-single-payer-means/471045/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Often</a>, the facts that additional taxes may be offset by lower costs for medical visits and a single-payer system would involve much lower administrative costs <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/people-have-no-idea-what-single-payer-means/471045/" rel="noopener noreferrer">go unnoticed</a>.</p>

<p>But despite the fact that neither H.R. 261, nor Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-all system came to fruition, it appears that the desire for a single-payer system persists. On January 24th, Congressman John Conyers (D-MI-13) reintroduced HR 676, a bill aimed at expanding Medicare to provide universal coverage for all Americans, <a href="https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/national-call-in-day-for-hr-676/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bill</a> he had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-conyers/fulfilling-the-promise-of_b_3676992.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">initially introduced</a> in 2003 and reintroduced in 2009, 2011 and 2013.&nbsp;The bill currently has 51 cosponsors.</p>

<p>Healthcare-NOW, an organization that advocates for a single-payer system, gave a detailed rundown of the bill’s highlights on their <a href="https://www.healthcare-now.org/legislation/hr-676/" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, but most notably it would cover every American citizen, and the new national healthcare service would negotiate prices with physicians, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and medical supply companies. They estimate the savings to the United States at $387 billion dollars <a href="https://www.healthcare-now.org/legislation/hr-676/" rel="noopener noreferrer">annually</a>.</p>

<p>So while a number of states have had their own failed initiatives <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/23/colorado-considers-replacing-obamacare-with-state-single-payer-plan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">for</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/12/18/vermont_abandons_plan_for_single_payer_health_care/" rel="noopener noreferrer">statewide</a> <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2012/february/why-did-single-payer-health-care-fail-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer">single payer systems</a>, proponents of universal healthcare can be encouraged by the fact that there are a number of members of Congress who still think single-payer is an option worth fighting for at a national level.</p>
