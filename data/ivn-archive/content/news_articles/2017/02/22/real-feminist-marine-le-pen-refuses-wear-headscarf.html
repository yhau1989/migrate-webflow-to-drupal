<p>Marine Le Pen is, some say, the face of alt-right in France. Political commentators on the left point to her anti-immigrant and anti-globalist rhetoric to brand her as a racist, à&nbsp;la Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Ironically, feminists and/or liberal politicians on the left have recently and increasingly been wearing headscarves to show solidarity with muslim countries.</p>

<p>Some might say that a real feminist would reject any country that&nbsp;forces a woman to cover her face — especially a female political leader from another state.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
