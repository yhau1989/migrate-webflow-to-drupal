<p><span>Following the</span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>Executive Order</span></a><span> that was released on January 25, 2017 regarding Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, the Department of Homeland Security released documents detailing how the administration plans to combat what they consider an “illegal immigration problem.”</span></p>

<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Implementing-the-Presidents-Border-Security-Immigration-Enforcement-Improvement-Policies.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>memo</span></a><span>, posted on the website of Homeland Security, aims to establish border security and immigration enforcement throughout the country.</span></p>

<p><span>Below are the 10 key points to understanding how the new immigration policy will work:</span></p>
<h2>1. A Policy to Remove People Who are In the Country Illegally</h2>
<p><b>Detention</b><span> of people who enter the country illegally, with the purpose of “</span><b>removal</b><span>” to prevent them from committing crimes. This applies to all “aliens” with exceptions to removal granted on a case-to-case basis.
</span></p>
<h2>2. More Agents on Duty</h2>
<p><b>Hiring more</b><span> Customs and Border Protection </span><b>agents and officers</b><span> to effectively detect, track, and apprehend all individuals that are illegally entering the United States. The administration aims to hire 5,000 new officers and 500 Air &amp; Marine agents, as well as to&nbsp;provide appropriate training and resources.
</span></p>
<h2>3. Expand Federal and Local Cooperation</h2>
<p><b>Expand</b><span> the</span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/287g" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>287(g) Program</span></a><span>, which currently authorizes the Director of ICE to make agreements with </span><b>state and local law enforcement agencies</b><span>, so they can perform immigration law enforcement functions.
</span></p>
<h2>4. Do More Analysis on Border Security</h2>
<p><span>&nbsp;A&nbsp;</span><b>Study of Border Security</b><span> to identify vulnerabilities and establish a more secure southern border will be conducted.
</span></p>
<h2>5. Build the Wall</h2>
<p><b>Building a Wall </b><span>along the southern border to deter illegal entry to the United States. This includes the construction of physical barriers and access roads for patrols. The construction involves appropriate materials and technology to achieve effective operational control of the border. It will require </span><b>allocation of available funding</b><span> for the planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall,</span> <span>including congressional budget requests.</span></p>
<h2>6. Expedite the Removal Process for Apprehended Individuals</h2>
<p><b>Expedited Removal Process </b><span>for individuals who are apprehended and who have been denied of relief or protection requests. If an officer determines that a person entered the country illegally, he or she can proceed with deportation without further hearing or review, unless special circumstances apply.
</span></p>
<h2>7. Opportunities of Asylum</h2>
<p><b>Option of requesting asylum </b><span>is possible for aliens who claim a fear of return to their country. An asylum officer will determine whether they have established a credible fear of persecution or torture.
</span></p>
<h2>8. Special Protections&nbsp;and Process for Minors</h2>
<p><b>Properly process and treat unaccompanied minors </b><span>who arrive at the border traveling alone and sometimes victims of human trafficking. If a child meets the definitions of "unaccompanied alien child" they will be entitled to temporary special protection rather that expedited removal.
</span></p>
<h2>9. Focus on Criminals</h2>
<p><b>Prioritizing Criminal Prosecutions </b><span>which include an enhanced counter network operation directed to combat transnational criminal organizations who may infiltrate the country.
</span></p>
<h2><strong>10. Develop Standardized Reporting Procedures</strong></h2>
<p><span>Develop standardized method for </span><b>public reporting</b><span> of border apprehensions to maintain transparency with the public.</span></p>
