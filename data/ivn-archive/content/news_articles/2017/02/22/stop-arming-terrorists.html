<p><strong>January 13, 2017</strong> -- <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/21/tulsi-gabbard-new-champion-independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rep. Tulsi Gabbard</a> argued on the floor of the House for support of the bipartisan Stop Arming Terrorists Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/608?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr608%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">H.R.608</a>).</p>

<p>Rep. Gabbard recently sponsored the <a href="https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/video-rep-tulsi-gabbard-urges-support-stop-arming-terrorists-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">the bill</a> with the purpose of ending American taxpayer funding of “weapons, training, and intelligence support to groups like the Levant Front, Fursan al Ha and other allies of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, al-Qaeda and ISIS, or to countries who are providing direct or indirect support to those same groups.”</p>

<p>The bill has some <a href="https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/video-rep-tulsi-gabbard-urges-support-stop-arming-terrorists-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">historical precedent </a>&nbsp;in the form of the Boland Amendment which prohibited funding and support for CIA backed-Nicaraguan Contras during the 1980’s.</p>

<p>This is an issue close to Congresswoman Gabbard, a combat veteran, whose opinion on the issue was impacted by her <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/01/27/tulsi-gabbard-attacked-partisans-media-peace-seeking-mission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">travels to Syria and Lebanon</a> in January to speak with the people living in these conflict zones:</p>
<blockquote>“Their (the Syrians) message to the American people was powerful and consistent: There is no difference between 'moderate' rebels and al-Qaeda (al-Nusra) or ISIS — they are all the same. This is a war between terrorists under the command of groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda and the Syrian government. They cry out for the U.S. and other countries to stop supporting those who are destroying Syria and her people.”</blockquote>
<p>Gabbard has taken to Twitter to express her passion for the bill:</p>
