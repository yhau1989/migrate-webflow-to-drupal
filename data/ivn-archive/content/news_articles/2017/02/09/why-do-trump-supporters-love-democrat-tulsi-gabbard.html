<p>Democrats in Congress have predominantly lined up in opposition to President Trump's agenda since he took office last month. Democratic U.S. Rep.&nbsp;Tulsi Gabbard, however, is one notable exception.</p>

<p>Rep. Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was thrust into the national spotlight last year when she <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/02/28/dnc-vice-chair-resigns-to-endorse-bernie-sanders-for-president/" rel="noopener noreferrer">resigned her position</a> as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse Bernie Sanders, a blow to the establishment which simultaneously angered and excited many. As a young, Hindu, woman&nbsp;who served in the military, Gabbard is&nbsp;poised to become a rising star on&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/12/31/167989125/not-your-fathers-or-mothers-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer">left</a>.</p>

<p>One policy position in particular, however, creates an interesting alliance between Rep. Gabbard and her unlikely allies&nbsp;in the Trump camp. Gabbard represents the oft-forgotten mantra of the anti-war left. When stepping down from her DNC role to back Bernie, Gabbard <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/28/468457319/vice-chair-of-dnc-resigns-to-support-bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"As a veteran and as a soldier I've seen firsthand the true cost of war. I think it's most important for us as we look at our choices as to who our next commander-in-chief will be ... to recognize the necessity to have a commander in chief who has foresight, who exercises good judgment."</blockquote>
<p>Trump supporters have voiced support for&nbsp;Rep. Gabbard online, especially on /r/The_Donald. Last November, when Gabbard met with Trump to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/gabbard-trump-transition/" rel="noopener noreferrer">discuss foreign policy</a>, /r/The_Donald was abuzz with praise for the Democratic representative.</p>

Vows to never Allow partisanship to undermine our national security. Goes off on Neocons and promises to defeat radical Islam!</a>.</div>


<p>The Hill reported that it was Bannon who arranged the November meeting between the two. “He loves Tulsi Gabbard. Loves her,” a source familiar with Bannon’s thinking <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/307106-bannon-set-up-trump-gabbard-meeting" rel="noopener noreferrer">told The Hill</a>. “Wants to work with her on everything.”</p>

<p>Bannon supposedly admires Gabbard&nbsp;for her independence from the establishment, along with her military experience.</p>

<p>Following their meeting, many speculated that Gabbard might <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/21/democrat-tulsi-gabbard-defends-trump-meeting-wont-play-politics-american-lives/" rel="noopener noreferrer">receive an appointment</a> in Trump’s cabinet, a move that&nbsp;appeared to excite many Trump supporters:</p>

Anti-war, Anti-interventionist, war vet. Would be a Trump 8D chess move!!!</a>.</div>


<p>Following her recent fact-finding <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/01/27/tulsi-gabbard-attacked-partisans-media-peace-seeking-mission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mission to Syria</a>, Gabbard was attacked viciously by the party establishment on both sides and media alike. Trump supporters, however, had a different take on the exchange:</p>

<p>Some supporters even believe Trump might still rip Gabbard from the strangle of the Democratic party:</p>

<p>Is the Tulsi love coming from the Trump camp really so surprising after all?</p>

<p>As a fiercely independent, anti-establishment, military veteran, Rep. Gabbard has a lot in common with a&nbsp;pro-Trump profile. Her willingness to work with President Trump, as well as others outside her party, puts her in a unique position on the left&nbsp;and her likability appears to transcend party -- a combination that could possibly create&nbsp;a politician&nbsp;who Bernie and Trump supporters alike can rally behind.</p>
