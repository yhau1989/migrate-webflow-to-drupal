<p>Until a few days ago, the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2008" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a>, "Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008" listed&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/search/barack+obama" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a>&nbsp;as the winner of&nbsp;the popular vote in the 2008 Democratic primary. However, Obama lost the popular vote in the primary, but won the nomination by garnering more&nbsp;delegates. Images below show snapshots from the Internet Archive, the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/web/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>

<p>In the world of fake news, why would one of our go-to fact checking resources be intentionally manipulated in such an innocuous way?</p>

<p>In 2016,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://ivn.us/search/hillary+clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> won both the Democratic primary's popular and delegate&nbsp;vote counts. Whether or not you are of the opinion that the party <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">colluded</a> against <a href="https://ivn.us/search/bernie+sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a>, the delegate and popular vote counts supported her legitimacy as the nominee.</p>

<p>More importantly, skip forward to 2017 and both Sanders&nbsp;and Clinton are targeting the "unfairness" of the Electoral College as the reason Donald Trump got elected -- where&nbsp;Hillary Clinton received 3 million more votes nationwide.</p>

<p>The problem presented in&nbsp;this narrative is that Democrats are almost universally in agreement that they like Barack Obama -- who received LESS votes than Clinton in the 2008 Democratic Primary.</p>

<p>So how did he win? Simple. He won the Democratic Party's version of the Electoral College -- the delegate count!</p>

<p>Hard to peddle a narrative that&nbsp;we need to embrace the popular vote when your private political party has chosen not to follow the popular vote, right?</p>

<p>So, for a period of three weeks, someone tried to cover this narrative by creating alternative facts on Wikipedia. Fortunately, reality's watchdog has since reverted the information back to correct the record.</p>

<p>Regardless, next time a member of the Democratic Party says to get rid of the Electoral College -- ask them when the Democratic Party is getting rid of their delegate process.</p>
