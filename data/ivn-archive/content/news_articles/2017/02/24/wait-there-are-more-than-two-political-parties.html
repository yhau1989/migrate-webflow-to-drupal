<p>That's right. Your options are not limited to McDonald's&nbsp;and Burger King -- there are all sorts of burger joints in the mix.</p>

<p>Food metaphors aside, modern politics does in fact offer more than the blue and red sides. While the&nbsp;2016 presidential election's "lesser of two evils" narrative inspired some to&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2016/09/27/source-voter-apathy-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer">apathy</a>, it also pushed many&nbsp;to <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/04/28/clinton-trump-alternatives-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>consider</strong> those third parties</a>, and&nbsp;provided&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/31/the-u-s-has-more-third-party-candidates-than-its-seen-in-a-century-why/?utm_term=.85a3acfb5b6e" rel="noopener noreferrer">more third party <strong>candidates</strong></a> than we've seen in a century.</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, while the political parties below exist, none have achieved automatic&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2016/10/17/watch-third-parties-independents-get-ballot-access/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballot access</a> in all <strong>50</strong> states for state elections -- yet.</p>
<div></div>


<p>The following third parties have&nbsp;access in at least 10 states&nbsp;for the upcoming 2018 election:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Constitution Party (<a href="https://www.constitutionparty.com/elections/ballot-access/" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 states</a>)</li>
 	<li>Green Party (<a href="http://www.gp.org/ballot_access" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 states</a>)</li>
 	<li>Libertarian Party (<a href="https://www.lp.org/2018-libertarian-ballot-access-map/" rel="noopener noreferrer">37 states</a>)</li>
 	<li>Various parties calling themselves "Independent" or "Independence" parties (<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_major_and_minor_party_candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 states</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, there&nbsp;are <strong>22 <em>more</em>&nbsp;third parties</strong> with ballot access in 1-4 states each, making it easy to&nbsp;join a third party, find political consonance, and <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/09/23/join-register-third-party-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer">send a message</a> to the major parties.</p>

<p>According to a 2016 Pew study, only 29% of American voters were&nbsp;Republican&nbsp;and 33% were&nbsp;Democrat - leaving 34%&nbsp;independent. Pew reported that of the independents surveyed 44% "lean Republican" and 48% "lean Democrat,"&nbsp;but did not give them the option to consider a third party.</p>

<p>The political options of the day seem limited, <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/09/13/the-parties-on-the-eve-of-the-2016-election-two-coalitions-moving-further-apart/" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly</a> oppositional, and unrepresentative of the electorate. <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/07/history-third-parties-us-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third parties</a>, as varied as they come, could be the answer to the political dissonance many appear to feel with the major parties.</p>
