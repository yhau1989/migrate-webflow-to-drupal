<p>The Republican Party of Alaska is sending a message to its own: If you don't put party first, you can't run in the primary.</p>

<p>KTVA reported that the party recently voted to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ktva.com/story/36980608/alaska-gop-votes-to-kick-three-incumbents-out-of-party-primary" rel="noopener noreferrer">change its rules</a> to kick three Republican lawmakers out of the primary for forming a coalition majority with Democrats and independents.</p>

<p>Ironically, the state GOP says it has the authority to do this because of a lawsuit the Democratic Party won against the state in October. Democrats challenged a state law that requires candidates running in a primary to be a registered member of the corresponding party.</p>

<p>Republicans say the superior court's decision in favor of the Democratic Party also means they have the right to exclude any candidates they want. Stay tuned for more developments on this story.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the rule change needs to be approved by the Alaska Division of Elections. Rule changes for the primary <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2017/12/07/alaska-gop-votes-block-3-house-representatives-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">were due in September</a>, so the board may not approve it or may rule it violates state law.</p>
