<p>A new mailer is gradually making its rounds on social media allegedly from the Doug Jones for Senate Committee, in the special US Senate election in Alabama.</p>

<p>The focus is on current sexual assault allegations against Republican Roy Moore, but does the mailer go too far?</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en">Per source in AL, here’s the new Doug Jones mailer. Ostensibly, it’s meant to up black turnout. <a href="https://t.co/tyX1fppj5h" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/tyX1fppj5h</a></p>

<p>It's no secret that partisanship in elections and in US politics is at an extreme, but Jones' committee appears to have taken it to such an extreme as to evoke race where it doesn't belong in order to hit a nerve with certain voters.</p>

<p>Decide for yourself what you think:</p>
