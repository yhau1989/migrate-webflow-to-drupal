<p>US Rep <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/tulsi-gabbard" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tulsi Gabbard</a> (D-Hawaii) released a video over her social media channels raising awareness on the issue of net neutrality and the fundamental reasons why she believes reversing Obama-era regulations would be devastating to the industry and consumers.</p>

<p>"Without net neutrality, internet providers will be able to throttle internet speeds, block websites behind paywalls, unfairly favor some content over others, and charge you extra fees for high-quality streaming," Gabbard says.</p>

<p>The FCC is scheduled to vote on the issue on December 14.</p>

<p>The IVN team polled Facebook followers last week, and an overwhelming majority voted against the FCC's current course to eliminate the net neutrality rules in place.</p>



<p>Nearly 3,300 IVN readers said the FCC should not scrap current regulations, but opinions in the comment section where plentiful and diverse.</p>
