searchTitle: What Everyone Seemed to Miss About the Alabama Senate Race
-->
<p>Many people woke up this morning to the news that Democrat Doug Jones won the special election for US Senate in Alabama. Jones <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doug-jones-wins-alabama-senate-race-special-election-results-roy-moore-not-conceding-2017-12-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer">won with 49.9 percent of the vote</a>, while Moore took 48.38 percent. The write-ins made a big difference in the race.</p>

<p>Still, while Democrats celebrate and Republicans turn attention to other matters, Maine independent and Clean Elections gubernatorial candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/terry-hayes" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Terry Hayes</strong></a> points out something people seem to be overlooking about the election:</p>
<p><em>"Last night, on my way back to Maine from meetings with other independent elected leaders from across the country, I took a flight from Denver to Atlanta and flew over Alabama. From 30,000 feet I looked down at the lights of Birmingham and Montgomery and wondered what the people of Alabama would do. When I landed at the Jetport, I discovered that Alabama voters had rejected Judge Roy Moore, and in doing so had scored a victory for decency.</em></p>
<p><em>Yesterday’s U.S. Senate election in Alabama wasn’t about Democrats, Republicans, or independents, it was about the principle that how we do things matters. How we talk to one another, how we talk about one another, how we treat one another, matters. It’s nearly impossible to get things done when our leaders are unable to even look one another in the eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>Our campaign isn’t about red versus blue, it’s about red, white, and blue. We’re working to unite Mainers around shared values, so we can get back to solving problems and getting things done. That’s what I’ve done as Maine's first independent State Treasurer, and it’s what I will do as your next Governor."</em></p>
<p>What do you think of the election?</p>
