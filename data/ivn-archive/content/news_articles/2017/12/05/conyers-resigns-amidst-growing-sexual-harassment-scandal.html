<p>US Rep. John Conyers announced Tuesday that he is "retiring today" amidst a sexual harassment scandal and growing calls for him to step down. The announcement comes the same day NBC News published new allegations against the congressman by a former staffer who says Conyers "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/conyers-allegations-ex-staffer-says-congressman-inappropriately-touched-her-n826561" rel="noopener noreferrer">inappropriately touched</a>" her.</p>

<p>Attorney Lisa Bloom posted a sworn&nbsp;affidavit on Twitter Monday on behalf of her client, Elisa Grubbs. Grubbs worked for Conyers from 2001 to 2013. Bloom says this is just one of "several affidavits she will be releasing."</p>

<p>Conyers further said he will endorse his son, John Conyers III, for his seat.</p>
