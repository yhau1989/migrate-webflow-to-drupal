<p>Atlanta City Councilor <strong><a href="https://marynorwood.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Norwood</a></strong> could be well on her way to becoming the city’s first independent mayor and one of the most prominent independent elected officials in the country on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to a survey of likely Atlanta voters released by WSB-TV Friday, independent Councilwoman Mary Norwood held a 6-point lead over her opponent, Councilor Keisha Lance Bottoms, heading into the December 5 runoff.</p>

<p>Norwood has attracted support from across the political spectrum, including business and labor, firefighters and police, LGBT and African-American leaders, and prominent Atlanta citizens, chief among them former Mayor Shirley Franklin.</p>

<p>In fact, almost all of Norwood’s opponents from the November general election have endorsed her in the runoff, including Atlanta City Council President Ceaser Mitchell, former Council President Cathy Woolard, Fulton County Commission Chairman John Eaves, and former State Representative Margaret Kaiser.</p>

<p>Reed, who defeated Norwood by 714 votes in the 2009 mayoral runoff election, has been plagued by <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/local/mayor-reed-bribery-investigation-don-need-money/5Ube8YsiABCHDKjDqf8tQM/" rel="noopener noreferrer">scandal</a> and his administration is under <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/former-city-purchasing-chief-pleads-guilty-atlanta-bribery-scandal/eBw5ltQ7o2Pk7v2X1jworM/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI investigation</a>.</p>

<p>Reed, who has drawn comparisons with Donald Trump for his heated rhetoric during the campaign, including calling Norwood and Council President Mitchell “<a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/gen-politics/reed-calls-rivals-losers-mitchell-backs-norwood/L2EJq4v2C9lma3iXzMARkJ/" rel="noopener noreferrer">losers</a>,” has endorsed Bottoms in Tuesday’s runoff.</p>

<p>No candidate received a majority in the November 7 Atlanta mayoral general election, setting up the December 5 runoff election between Norwood and Reed’s handpicked successor, Bottoms.</p>

<p>Independent leaders across the country have been following the Atlanta mayoral election in the hopes that a Norwood victory could be an indication of independent political wins in 2018 and beyond.</p>

<p>Groups like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/maineindependents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine Independents</a>, <a href="http://www.waindependents.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Independents</a>, and <a href="http://www.centristproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Centrist Project</a>, which chapters across the country, are working to recruit historic numbers of credible independent candidates to run for public office in 2018.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party of Georgia, which holds no statewide elected offices in Georgia, hopes to hold the mayor’s office at all costs.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the party has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on false attack ads that mischaracterize Norwood as a Republican and place her alongside photos of Donald Trump in literature that has been distributed in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party deployed similar attacks in the 2009 mayoral runoff election. However, this time around the Norwood campaign seems better prepared to respond with credible messengers, many of whom supported Kasim Reed in 2009 and have expressed their disappointment in his administration.</p>

<p>Norwood makes no apologies for her political independence in what is a traditionally Democratic city, reaffirming that she is a “progressive independent.”</p>

<p>Polls open across Atlanta at 7 am and close at 8 pm on Tuesday, December 5.</p>
