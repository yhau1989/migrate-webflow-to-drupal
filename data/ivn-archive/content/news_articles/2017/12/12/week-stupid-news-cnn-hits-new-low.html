<p>Trust in the media continues to be at an all-time low. Yet it doesn't seem like the mainstream news media has learned anything. Even after an attempted terrorist attack in New York City, CNN found time to report on an in-depth New York Times investigation on how much Diet Coke President Donald Trump drinks. An entire segment on CNN was devoted to President Trump's love for Diet Coke, fast food intake, and his TV watching habits.</p>

<p>THIS IS NOT NEWS, and most certainly deserves the title: The stupidest story of the week... and it is only Monday.</p>
