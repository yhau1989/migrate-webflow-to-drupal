searchTitle: Debbie Wasserman Schultz Declared Most Unethical Politician
-->
<p>Keeping staffers under criminal investigation employed and rigging a primary election process to the favor of the party-anointed candidate is certainly enough to make the list of "worst ethics violators."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.factdc.org/single-post/2017/12/18/Ethics-Watchdog-Releases-Top-5-Worst-Ethics-Violators-of-2017" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust</a> (FACT) released its list of "top 5 ethics violators of 2017." At the top of the list, second only to the unnamed members of Congress linked to the fresher and ongoing sexual harassment scandal, is US Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).</p>
<p><em>"In July, FACT filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) against Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) for continuing to employ and compensate House IT Aide, Imran Awan after he was barred from the House computer system and under criminal investigation. According to FACT’s complaint, Wasserman Schultz refused to remove Awan from House payroll and compensated Awan with taxpayer funds for several months – even though he was barred from the House computer system which would prevent him from performing any reasonable IT work."</em></p>
<p>FACT adds, "In fact, Wasserman Schultz only fired Awan after he was arrested on bank fraud charges attempting to flee the country the morning of July 25, 2017. Wasserman Schultz is in clear violation of House Ethics Rules as Members are directly responsible for ensuring their staff are only paid for official public work."</p>

<p>IVN covered the Imran Awan story when most media outlets either refused to or ignored it completely:</p>

<p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/04/24/sanders-supporters-get-day-court-dnc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">was also sued</a>, along with the DNC, for rigging the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in favor of Hillary Clinton by intentionally minimizing the Bernie Sanders campaign.</p>

<p>The DNC&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/02/courts-cant-protect-right-vote-private-corporations-control-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">defended its right to rig the party's nomination process</a> however it wanted, regardless of the will or rights of voters.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/ivn/status/943347378962255873</p>

<p>Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair in 2016 in the wake of the <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">email scandal</a> that exposed top party officials in the primary scheme, including <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/11/02/former-dnc-chair-clinton-obama-wasserman-schultz-corrupted-dnc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donna Brazile</a>, who said the party under Wasserman Schultz's leadership was essentially robbing state and local parties of funding and giving it to the Clinton camp.</p>

<p>Brazile said the Clinton campaign was allowed to take over the Democratic Party completely way before Hillary won the nomination.</p>

<p>So what do you think? Do you agree that Wasserman Schultz is the most unethical politician in Washington?</p>
