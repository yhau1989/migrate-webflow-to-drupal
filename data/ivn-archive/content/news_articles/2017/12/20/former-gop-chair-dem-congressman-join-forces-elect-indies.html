<p>T.J. O’Hara is joined by Brian Baird, former Democratic U.S. representative and co-founder of <a href="http://www.waindependents.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Independents</a>. The two discuss the partisanship and dysfunction in state legislatures and Congress, the Centrist Project and its approach, as well as the principles and goals of the organization he co-founded with former GOP Chair Chris Vance to elect independents.</p>



<p>“There was a time when you could work across the aisle with reasonable people on boths sides and get things done. And that has gotten harder and harder and harder to do, right now," says Baird.</p>

<p>The Honorable Brian Baird, Ph.D. served six terms (12 years) in the United States House of Representatives, representing Washington State’s 3rd Congressional District.</p>

<p>Prior to serving in Congress, Baird chaired the Department of Psychology at Pacific Lutheran University and for more than two decades practiced clinically, specializing in neuropsychology.</p>

<p>Baird is also the founder and president of 4Pir2 Communication, a consulting firm focused on public policy and science communication.</p>
