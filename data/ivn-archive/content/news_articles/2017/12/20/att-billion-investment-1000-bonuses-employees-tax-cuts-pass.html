<p>Congress passed landmark tax reform legislation Wednesday that lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% and individual tax rates across most tax brackets.</p>

<p>After the final vote, AT&amp;T sent out a memo to its employees as well as a <a href="http://about.att.com/story/att_tax_reform.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> saying it will invest $1 Billion in the US in 2018, and will give a $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 of its employees.</p>

<p>That is a promise of over $200,000,000 in bonuses. AT&amp;T promises to give this bonus over the holidays if President Donald Trump signs the bill this week.</p>
