<p>Read our centrist recap for the week below. We shine a light on the spin and useless stories from the Left and Right and detail what you should focus on, before people can pull wool over your eyes.</p>
<h4>What the&nbsp;<em>partisans</em>&nbsp;will focus on and&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;should avoid:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>A tweet calling President Trump a “tool” and “pathetic loser” came from Anderson Cooper’s Twitter account last week. CNN at first claimed it was hacked, then stated it was actually the result of Cooper’s assistant’s phone (which had access to Cooper’s account) being stolen at a gym. The Right will obviously run this for a while, but in reality, it will have no impact on our lives or our world.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>FCC voted to repeal Net Neutrality last week</strong>&nbsp;in a 3-2 vote along partisan lines. The repeal will be met with legal battles and could face Congressional action, so it’s not a finality, but it is a big win for the “infrastructure” side of the house.&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-can-expect-fcc-kills-net-neutrality-153211716.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s an article that gives a reasonable look (hint: it’s neither the apocalypse nor the beginning of a North Korean style internet in the U.S.) at what might occur due to this action.</a></li>
 	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Alabama special election</strong>&nbsp;was one for the ages.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://apnews.com/6aa7239162a3483591c914720496cbd8/Things-to-know-about-Alabama's-new-US-senator,-Doug-Jones?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic candidate Doug Jones&nbsp;</a>beat Republican candidate Roy Moore by a very close margin</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/defiant-roy-moore-says-its-not-over/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roy Moore still hasn’t conceded</a>&nbsp;despite President Trump tweeting congratulations to Doug Jones. We know what this election means for Alabama, but do all these special elections mean anything for 2018? FiveThirtyEight has&nbsp;<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" rel="noopener noreferrer">a great article</a>&nbsp;in which they attempt to answer that question.</li>
 	<li>We know you’re tired of hearing about it; we’re tired of writing about it. The reality is, we can’t let ourselves ignore it.&nbsp;<strong>Even more allegations of&nbsp;sexual misconduct</strong>&nbsp;<strong>by our elected officials</strong>&nbsp;came out this week, again hitting both sides of the aisle. Some of the accused were&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/3755583baa2342cea80aa812c3cf6159/Nevada-Democrat,-facing-ethics-probe,-won't-seek-re-election?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representative Ruben Kihuen (D – Nevada)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/us/politics/blake-farenthold-texas-harassment.html?referer=http://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representative&nbsp;Blake Farenthold&nbsp;(R – Texas)</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/12/14/a-lawmaker-accused-of-molesting-a-teen-killed-himself-his-widow-calls-it-a-high-tech-lynching/?utm_term=.09cfdf5eef9f" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representative&nbsp;Dan Johnson (R – Kentucky)</a>. Representatives Ruben Kihuen and Blacke Farenthold will not seek reelection, and, we’re sad to announce that Representative Dan Johnson has taken his own life (it is not known at this time if the suicide was due to the allegations or not).</li>
 	<li>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, while fighting off rumors of his departure, has continued to work on the U.S.’s relationship with North Korea. He has stated&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/us-urges-talks-north-korea-brags-nuclear-arsenal-235001969.html?__twitter_impression=true" rel="noopener noreferrer">the U.S. is ready to speak with North Korea without preconditions</a></strong>, something that could help move the relationship into more stable conditions.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/11/569936446/president-trump-is-sending-nasa-back-to-the-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>President Trump formally told NASA to send astronauts to the moon</strong></a>&nbsp;and wants to restart NASA’s program of human exploration of space. President Trump hopes NASA can not only visit the moon but establish a “foundation for an eventual mission to Mars.”</li>
