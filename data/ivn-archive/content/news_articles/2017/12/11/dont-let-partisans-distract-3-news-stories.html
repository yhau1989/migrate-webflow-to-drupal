<p>Read our centrist recap for the week below. We shine a light on the spin and useless stories from the Left and Right and detail what you should focus on, before people can pull wool over your eyes.</p>
<h4>What the&nbsp;<em>partisans</em>&nbsp;will focus on and&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;should avoid:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>This week, just like last, and for a few weeks to come, both sides are going to be finger pointing and attempting to prove the other side is worse than they are. After all the&nbsp;<strong>sexual misconduct in Congres</strong><strong>s and politics</strong>, the parties will attempt to make the claim that the sins of their own are less than the sins of their opponent. Both sides will attempt to show you that their wrongdoers are remorseful, and continuously point to their apologies, but<strong>&nbsp;the apologies are weak</strong>. This article tells it well:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/12/5/16735810/utter-failure-male-apologies-2017" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Utter Failure of Male Apologies in 2017</a>.&nbsp; The bottom line is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. We’re seeing what an unbridled two party system can do to our political system. The two parties elect people based on power and loyalty not on policy and morality. America, it’s time for a change.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>should focus on:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid focusing on the apologies from those who’ve committed sexual misconduct, but do focus on those leaving their office due to it. So far,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/john-conyers-announces-retirement-congress-endorses-son-amid-harassment-scandal-n826616" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representative John Conyers (D – Michigan)</a>&nbsp;has chosen to retire, effective immediately, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/07/all-eyes-sen-al-franken-who-may-resign-because-sexual-misconduct-allegations/930006001/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senator Al Franken (D – Minnesota)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/politics/trent-franks-house-member-resigns.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representative Trent Franks</a>&nbsp;(R – Arizona) have announced their resignation.</strong></li>
 	<li>President Trump’s administration has announced it’s going to&nbsp;<strong>let a waiver on the Jerusalem Embassy Act expire, setting in motion&nbsp;the U.S. embassy’s move to Jerusalem</strong>. This could have major impacts across the Middle East and Northern Africa. By moving the embassy to Jerusalem President Trump is fulfilling one of his campaign promises, but he’s also threatening stability in an already shaky region and may be destroying any hope he had of brokering peace. A great article (written days prior to the Trump Administration announcing intent to move the embassy) on the background behind the embassy’s location and how to move the embassy can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/11/30/how-to-move-the-u-s-embassy-to-jerusalem/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You’ll notice the “worst-case scenario” is quite interesting…</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-evacuations-ordered-california-wildfires-whip-across-region-n828221" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>California has been battling the worst forest fires in the last decade for a week now</strong>.</a>&nbsp;The fires have forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people and destroyed over 800 structures. Currently, around 9,000 firefighters work to contain the blazes. This article shows good ways to donate and help those in need in California:&nbsp;<a href="http://beta.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-california-fires-20171208-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">How You Can Help Fire Victims in Southern California</a></li>
