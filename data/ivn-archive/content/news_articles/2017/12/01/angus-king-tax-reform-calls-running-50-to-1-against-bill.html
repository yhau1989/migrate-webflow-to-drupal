<p>Independent US Senator Angus King was brought on MSNBC's <em>Morning Joe</em> Friday to talk about the GOP tax reform bill scheduled to be voted on. King says the process for moving the bill forward has been the "worst ever."</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything like this," King says. "On this huge bill, this huge impact, do you know how many impacts we have had on this bill? Zero! Nothing! Nada! Zilch! We're talking about voting on it today, Joe -- We don't even know what the bill is. As of now, no one can tell you what is in this bill."</p>

<p>He later added, "We're not looking before we leap off a 30-year cliff."</p>

<p>King believes the GOP is rushing the bill because the more people find out about it, the more they realize how terrible it is. He said calls to his office were "running 50-to-1 against this bill."</p>
