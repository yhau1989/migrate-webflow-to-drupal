<p>Gallup <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/224672/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-retain-admired-titles.aspx?g_source=Politics&amp;g_medium=lead&amp;g_campaign=tiles" rel="noopener noreferrer">released its annual poll of most admired men and women</a> of the year. Most of the headlines point to the results as another year both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were named the most admired man and woman among Americans.</p>

<p>The results are interesting considering 2017 was also the year Hillary dropped to her <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/224330/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating-new-low.aspx?g_source=Politics&amp;g_medium=newsfeed&amp;g_campaign=tiles" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest favorability rating</a>.</p>

<p>A closer look at the poll shows that Obama edged President Trump by 3 points, 17-14. Hillary Clinton only got 9 percent of the responses for most admired woman, followed closely by Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>Gallup also reports that a quarter of respondents didn't name anyone they admire most, while 9 percent named a friend or family member.</p>

<p>In many ways, this poll represents the American election system well. The two people we are stuck with were selected by a minority of respondents, while a larger percentage of respondents refused to answer because they don't have someone they are satisfied with.</p>

<p>Fairly spot on comparison, if you ask me.</p>
