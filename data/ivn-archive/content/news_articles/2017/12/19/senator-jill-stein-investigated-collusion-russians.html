<p>It was <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/the-senates-russia-investigation-is-now-looking-into-jill?utm_term=.npBK1AKlR#.mtAVQxVy9" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Monday</a> that former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein's campaign has been asked to comply with a document search by the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>

<p>When asked what the committee was looking for specifically, committee chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) said, "collusion with the Russians."</p>

<p>Jill Stein released a statement, saying that she is fully cooperating with the committee's request, adding:</p>

<p><em>"To restore trust in our elections and democracy itself, we must safeguard our elections from all potential sources of interference, whether by foreign actors or domestic political partisans, criminal networks, lone wolves, or private corporations -- including those who control the voting software."</em></p>

<p>Stein has not been a major part of the investigation. A letter was sent to Donald Trump Jr in July requesting all communications between a number of other people, including Russia officials, Trump campaign staff, and Stein.</p>

<p>A picture also surfaced showing Stein, former national security advisor Michael Flynn, and Russia President Vladimir Putin sitting at the same table during a 2015 banquet dinner. Stein testified before Congress in December 2015 about her trip to Russia, and says Democrats loyal to Clinton and liberal-leaning websites like Think Progress are spreading false information to smear her and her campaign.</p>
