<p>Kim Guadagno, who is New Jersey's lieutenant governor and secretary of state, is expected to run&nbsp;for governor in the GOP's June primary election against Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli. Guadagno is currently considered the odds-on favorite to win a primary election that&nbsp;is not likely to turn out many voters.</p>

<p>Guadagno has served in her post since 2010, during which time she defended New Jersey's&nbsp;primary election law that gives the Republican and Democratic parties a monopoly&nbsp;over the state's election process.</p>

<p>In 2014, a nonpartisan coalition led by the <a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Independent Voter Project</strong></a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/05/lawsuit-filed-nj-federal-court-challenges-constitutionality-partisan-primary-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a lawsuit</a> challenging closed primary elections in New Jersey. The coalition, which included 7 individual plaintiffs, argued that the current system gives political parties and their members a decided advantage in the democratic franchise at the expense of individual voters, including nearly half of voters who choose not to identify with either major party.</p>

<p>“The natural consequence of New Jersey’s election process is […] the institutionalization of minority rule,” the Independent Voter Project wrote in a petition to the Supreme Court.</p>
<blockquote>“Indeed, interest of the Republican and Democratic political parties are so embedded in the State’s establishment that the State of New Jersey finds itself here today defending a system that overtly and unnecessarily protects the private rights of two political organizations at the expense of the voting rights of its own citizens.”</blockquote>

<p>Guadagno argued that voters do not have a fundamental right to vote in taxpayer-funded primary elections and that if voters feel disenfranchised by the current process, they should "simply join a party." Further, the secretary of state says plaintiffs were trying to force private political parties to allow nonmembers to participate in their elections, a claim the plaintiffs <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/19/nj-judge-rules-republicans-democrats-qualified-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicitly&nbsp;denied</a> in previous motions.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was heard by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/04/09/third-circuit-avoids-breaking-two-party-monopoly/" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2015</a>. The court affirmed a lower court's decision to dismiss the constitutional challenge,&nbsp;holding that New Jersey may decide who does and does not have a fundamental right to cast a vote in the primary election. The Independent Voter Project&nbsp;filed a petition with the Supreme Court, but the high court&nbsp;chose not to take up the case.</p>

<p>Neither candidate in the June GOP primary will likely receive very many votes. Total primary turnout for both parties in the last gubernatorial election was&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.nj.gov/state/elections/2013-results/2013-official-primary-voter-turnout.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">9 percent</a></strong> of the eligible voting population. Yet, taxpayers -- including the millions&nbsp;barred from participating in primary elections -- end up footing the bill for these multi-million dollar elections.</p>
