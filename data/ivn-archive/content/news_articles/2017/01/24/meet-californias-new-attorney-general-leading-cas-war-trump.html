<p><strong>Sacramento, Calif.</strong> — By a vote of 26 to 9, the legislature in Sacramento on Monday confirmed Democrat Xavier Becerra for attorney general. Becerra has vowed to defend the state's liberal policies against the Trump administration and the Republican Congress.</p>

<p>He will replace former California Attorney General Kamala Harris, a Democrat who was elected to the U.S. Senate in November.</p>

<p>Becerra says he will fight any federal law he believes infringes on the rights of Californians.</p>

<p>Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon said on Becerra’s new post, "It's a role to defend the progress and the values of the people of California. These are extraordinary times and require extraordinary actions."</p>

<p>A Stanford-trained attorney, elected to Congress in 1993, Becerra represented the Los Angeles area in the U.S. House and is the highest-ranking Latino in Congress.</p>

<p>"I couldn't ask for a better job," said Becerra, to be sworn in by Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday. "It is humbling and exciting to assume responsibility for vigorously advancing the forward-leaning values that make California unique among the many states."</p>

<p>At least two Republican senators weren’t certain Becerra was the right choice.</p>

<p>John Moorlach of Costa Mesa says he's worried Becerra would, “jeopardize federal funds as attorney general by attacking the Trump administration.”</p>

<p>Meantime, Republican Sen. Joel Anderson of Alpine, said, “he's not persuaded Becerra would be tough enough on crime.”</p>

<p>Becerra worked as a deputy attorney general for three years before he successfully ran for an Assembly seat in 1990.</p>
