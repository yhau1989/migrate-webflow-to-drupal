<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is signing executive orders left and right. <strong>Reuters</strong> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN1532T3" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that his advisers vetted more than 200 orders, and <strong>Fox News</strong> judicial analyst <strong>Judge Andrew Napolitano</strong> also <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/01/19/judge-napolitano-trump-will-sign-many-200-executive-orders-monday" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;Trump will sign as many as 200 orders Monday.</p>

<p>This may prove to be a trying ceremony, as Trump's signature takes <a href="https://qz.com/891546/donald-trump-official-signature-trump-takes-a-tediously-long-time-to-sign-his-name/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a>&nbsp;3-6 times longer than Obama's did. The 11 letters of his name take him 6-7 seconds and over 30 strokes to complete. Left-handed <strong>Barack Obama</strong>, and other previous presidents, took&nbsp;1-2 seconds to scribble their John Hancock's.</p>

<p>As far as signatures go, Trump's has&nbsp;inspired references to <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong>:</p>

<p>As well as a way to determine an earthquake's magnitude:</p>

<p><strong>Slate</strong> went as far as to call&nbsp;his signature a "cry for help":</p>

<p>During the primary,&nbsp;<strong>Politico</strong> had a handwriting specialist <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/donald-trump-handwriting-analysis-2016-candidates-213161" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyze</a> candidates' signatures. Their analyst was Michelle Dresbold, a graduate of the U.S. Secret Service's Advanced Document Examination program.</p>

<p>She found that Trump's angles-only signature depicts an angry, determined, fearful, and competitive scribe. Dresbold wrote that a script devoid of curves&nbsp;points to a lack of empathy, and a craving for power, prestige, and admiration.</p>

<p>Whether Trump's signature depicts his inner nature, or if he'll truly sign 200 executive orders Monday, there's a big week ahead. We'll see what President Trump gets up to in his first full week as <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23POTUS&amp;src=typd" rel="noopener noreferrer">#POTUS</a>.</p>
