<p>San Diego, CALIF.- District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis has confirmed she will not be seeking re-election in 2018.</p>

<p>Dumanis has led the District Attorney's office for 14 years. She told her staff of the decision in a Tuesday morning email.</p>

<p>Dumanis said said she reached the decision over the holiday season,&nbsp;and consulted&nbsp;with family and colleagues before making the decision.</p>

<p>Dumanis&nbsp;said she is pleased with the progress the District Attorney’s Office has made evolved and is comfortable saying goodbye.</p>

<p>In an <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/sd-me-dumanis-announcement-20170113-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with the San Diego Union Tribune </a>Dumanis said, “I have other things to do. I’ve been in public service now for 42 years and, you know, I just thought the timing was right,” Dumanis said.</p>

<p>If Dumanis resigns before her term ends, the Board of Supervisors will select an interim appointment. One name that has come up repeatedly is&nbsp;Summer Stephan, a chief deputy under Dumanis.</p>
