<p><strong>San Diego, Calif.</strong> - U.S. Rep. <strong>Scott Peters</strong> (D-Calif.) released a statement Monday announcing that he will be attending President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s inauguration ceremony Friday, saying he "greatly respects the office of the Presidency, even if he does not respect the man who will now inhabit it."</p>

<p>Peters' statement comes after headlines flooded social media about members of Congress who have said they will not attend the Presidential Inauguration. These lawmakers include a&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/885795/who-is-not-attending-trumps-inauguration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">half dozen</a> Democrats from California.</p>

<p>On Sunday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) tweeted:</p>

<p>Peters, however, says he&nbsp;was elected to do a job and will show up Friday to "bear witness to the peaceful transition of power, which remains the bedrock of our democracy."</p>

<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>â€œI greatly respect the office of the Presidency, even if I don't respect the man who will now inhabit it. So I will join Presidents Obama and Clinton, Secretary Clinton, Senator Harris, and hundreds of my colleagues at the inauguration. And then, the next day, I'll join my wife, daughter, and dozens of San Diegans and march to send a clear message to our new President about what we stand for.

"The ability to respect the office of the Presidency and acknowledge the results of an election, but then turn around the next day and continue to fight for justice and progress, is the very essence of what it means to be free in this country."</blockquote>
<p>Peters represents&nbsp;California's 52nd congressional district, located in San Diego. His district is&nbsp;nearly evenly split between Democrats, Republicans, and No Party Preference (independent) voters.</p>

<p>Peters said he will also be attending the Women's March on Washington on Saturday.</p>
