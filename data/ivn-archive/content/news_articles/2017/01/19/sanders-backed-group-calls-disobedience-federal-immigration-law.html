<p><strong><a href="https://ourrevolution.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Revolution</a></strong>, an organization started by U.S. Senator <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), sent an email to supporters Wednesday, asking them to sign a petition to support California's SB 54, the California Values Act, which would further raise tensions&nbsp;between California and the incoming <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump administration</a>.</p>

<p>SB 54, sponsored&nbsp;by California Senate President Kevin de León (D-Logan Heights), bans the use of state and local resources to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in deportation actions.</p>

<p>"Cities and states across the country will play a big role in building the resistance against Trump — that's why it is so important that we continue organizing at the local level in our communities," said Erika Andiola,&nbsp;Political Outreach Manager for Our Revolution.</p>

<p>Specifically, the bill&nbsp;would remove Section 11369 of the Health and Safety Code, which mandates that arresting agencies notify the appropriate federal deportation agency should they arrest a person “for a violation of specified controlled substance provisions [and who] may not be a citizen of the United States.”</p>

<p>Our Revolution's&nbsp;letter claims the bill can pave the way for other states and local municipalities to&nbsp;"enact policies that will block Trump’s efforts to target, criminalize, deport, and incarcerate people of color." Trump has suggested post-election that&nbsp;he will push for&nbsp;deportation policies <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-deportation-barack-obama-3-million-ice-border-immigrants-a7421831.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar to President Barack Obama</a>.</p>

<p>Our Revolution quotes Senator de León:</p>
<blockquote>"To the millions of undocumented residents pursuing and contributing to the California Dream, the State of California will be your wall of justice should the incoming Administration adopt an inhumane and over-reaching mass-deportation policy. We will not stand by and let the federal government use our state and local agencies to separate mothers from their children."</blockquote>
<p>"We are not going to allow federal immigration agents to instill fear in our communities and deport families who call California home," states Our Revolution.</p>

<p>Our Revolution continues to gain influence in the Democratic Party and California politics. Earlier this month,&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2017/01/16/revolution-within-berniecrats-take-california-democratic-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 600 progressive candidates</a> (who supported Sanders' presidential campaign) were elected as California assembly district delegates -- taking a clear majority of delegates.</p>
