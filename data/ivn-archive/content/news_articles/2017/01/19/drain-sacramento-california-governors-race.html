<p><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong>- If former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was the warm-up act, <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> is the headliner.</p>

<p>For outsiders looking to “get into” politics, the 45th President of the United States is an example of what an outsider, with a near perfect, populous message can accomplish.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, Donald Trump has a <a href="http://ivn.us/2017/01/11/donald-trump-americas-showman/" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media skill set</a> most would-be candidates can only dream of, but that doesn’t appear to be holding the business class back. News broke this week that successful businessman <strong>Peter Thiel</strong> might campaign for California governor in 2018.</p>

<p>From Thiel to Mark Zuckerberg to Jeff Bezos and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, there is an undercurrent of momentum suggesting we might see the non-political get very political over the next 4 years. When asked on CNN about a possible run for the White House in 2020, Schultz said, “never say never.”</p>

<p>Mindy Tucker-Fletcher, who ran Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's re-election campaign in California years ago, noted on IVN’s most recent podcast that, “Peter Thiel could be a formidable candidate in California. He has the money and maybe most importantly, good name ID.”</p>

<p>But would Thiel want THAT job?</p>

<p>California is the tip of the spear in leading the charge against the Trump administration. The fire and brimstone coming from Sacramento legislators these days might create tough sledding for Thiel, who was a public supporter of Trump.</p>

<p>Chad Peace, president of <a href="https://ivc.media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVC Media</a>, noted, “The rhetoric coming from Democrats in Sacramento is dangerous. They’re painting everyone who supports Trump as racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic fools. First, that’s not the case and second, it’s tough to walk back that kind of rhetoric. Particularly in light of the fact that Thiel is a homosexual.”</p>

<p>The unique attribute of Trump, highlighted in his social media headline, “Drain The Swamp,” is he’s the first candidate in maybe the last 30 years who isn’t beholden to the lobbyists, the PACs, the money class in Washington, D.C. Not only did they not give him money, he refused to take it, so he doesn’t feel like he owes them anything.</p>

<p>That kind of message could serve a Republican very well in California. Don’t be surprised if “Drain Sacramento” becomes a campaign slogan for one of the Republicans running for governor in 2018.</p>
