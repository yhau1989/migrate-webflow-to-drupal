<p>January 20, 2017, marked the 58th Inaugural Ceremony and the swearing in of President <strong><a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald J. Trump</a></strong>. Trump's speech, though brief, focused on what he asserts his 2016 presidential campaign was about: taking power away from the Washington elite, the political establishment, and returning it to the people.</p>
<blockquote>"Today we are not really transferring power from one administration to another, or one party to another, we are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth." - President Donald J. Trump</blockquote>
<p>Trump set the tone with that quote, and followed it with a rebuke of the political establishment and a promise to put America and its people first. After the inauguration, Trump blasted out several tweets on his personal Twitter account, though the president's official Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/potus" rel="noopener noreferrer">@POTUS</a>, is now officially his.</p>

<p>He tweeted out paraphrases and specific quotes from his inaugural address:</p>

<p>Trump's pledge on day one of his presidency was&nbsp;that the men and women who had been forgotten by the Washington elite, the working class Americans ignored by the <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/15/so-called-nonpartisan-polls-top-party-consultants/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pollsters</a>, the media, and the political establishment will be forgotten no more under his administration.</p>



<p>Donald Trump's <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/11/09/independent-voters-flipped-entire-presidential-election-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">victory</a> in the 2016 presidential election can be attributed to rural, working class voters in key battleground states who felt <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/11/07/independent-voter-surge-result-election-day-surprise/" rel="noopener noreferrer">disenchanted and disenfranchised</a> by the current electoral system and the political status quo. These voters flipped from supporting Barack Obama in 2008 under a successful populist message to Donald Trump who ran on his own populist message.</p>

<p>Bottom line, millions of voters are looking for change, and Trump tapped into that both on the campaign trail and his inaugural address. Voters want someone to break down the walls set up by the Washington elite around the nation's capital. They want politicians who will put voters&nbsp;first, not party, donors, or other special interests.</p>

<p>Whether or not Trump can deliver on his promise&nbsp;remains to be seen. What did you think of President Trump's inaugural address?</p>
