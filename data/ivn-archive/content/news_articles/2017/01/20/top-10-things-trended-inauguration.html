<p>January 20 marked the day that Donald Trump took the Oath of Office as the 45th President of the United States. From multiple protests around the country, to thousands of supporters in Washington, D.C., memorable speeches and some questionable wardrobes, take a look at what people said during Inauguration Day:</p>

<p>Trump started the day very early, preparing for the ceremony that would “continue the movement, and begin the work.” <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PresidentTrump&amp;src=tyah" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PresidentTrump</a></p>

<p>Later, the country joined him on the social platform, to express their feeling regarding the new leader of the free world. Previous to the ceremony, many pointed out the crowd – or lack of, at the National Mall. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=mall&amp;src=typd" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Mall</a></p>
