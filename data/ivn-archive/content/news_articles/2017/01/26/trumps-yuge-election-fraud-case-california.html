<p>President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> announced&nbsp;Tuesday evening that an investigation into election and voter fraud is coming: “I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!” Trump tweeted.</p>

<p>This is music to the ears of many California voters – especially those whose party registrations were changed right before the June Primary, ensuring a Hillary Clinton win over challenger Bernie Sanders.&nbsp;California was a crucial state for both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, but the election was called for Clinton minutes after the polls closed, but before millions of provisional ballot votes were counted.</p>

<p>“What?” you ask, because&nbsp;Democrats insist that fraud during elections is a myth. They claim voter fraud is “virtually non-existent,” buying votes is too difficult and too “legally risky to pull off,” tampering with voting machines is a misnomer because they are often backed up by paper ballots or other means of auditing.</p>
<h2><strong>November Election 2016</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the left and some on the right insisting there is no election or voter fraud to speak of in the United States, there is plenty of evidence otherwise in California.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.electionintegrityproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election Integrity Project</a> founder Linda Paine notified the California Secretary of State through her attorney, that they were teaching the wrong law to county registrars. That law, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB450" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 450</a>, would allow voters to vote in person at “vote centers” located at public spots throughout their county for the 10 days prior to an election, including two weekends, and voters will receive a vote by mail ballot that can be returned by mail, or dropped off at any vote center. This essentially legalizes ballot harvesting and authorizes counties to remove from voters, the right to vote in person.</p>

<p>However, SB 450 does not actually go into effect until January 1, 2018. Of course Alex Padilla, the Secretary of State knew this, but was training county registrars on it anyway as if it was being implemented.</p>

<p>And when notified by EIP’s attorney, Padilla’s office blacklisted and shut out the Election Integrity Project entirely, as did every County Registrar EIP had been working with, according to Paine.</p>
<h2><strong>Government Harassment&nbsp;Continued</strong></h2>
<p>On Election Day the Trac Phones Linda Paine had purchased for her volunteers suddenly stopped working, and her office phone was tampered with and she was not able to use it or access messages. Consequently, no one on Election Day in California was able to contact the only group available to do anything about election and voter fraud.</p>

<p>And apparently, there was plenty of fraud at the polls, according to Linda Paine, who trains volunteers and personally monitors voting practices right at the polls. “We saw people taking stacks of completed ballots, reading them, and then stuffing them into boxes that were not the official ballot boxes,” Paine said in an interview. “We called the police, District Attorneys, County Counsel and major fraud departments, and no one came. No one! We held the election officials off for three hours, and finally had to turn over the boxes.”</p>

<p>This is what Linda Paine and all of the Election Integrity Project volunteers have been dealing with in California since 2010; their pleas for election justice have gone unheeded because of a corrupt Democrat-run government.</p>

<p>But now, there’s a new Sheriff in town…</p>
<h2><strong>Dead Voters, Fake Voters, Illegal Voters and Non-Voters</strong></h2>
<p>A&nbsp;recent&nbsp;<a href="http://yournewswire.com/stanford-university-confirm-democratic-election-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">study by Stanford University</a>&nbsp;proved that&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/people/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a>‘s campaign pre-rigged the system to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationofchange.org/2016/07/10/new-stanford-study-shows-serious-voting-discrepancies-favor-clinton/" rel="noopener noreferrer">steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders.</a>&nbsp;And it was never more apparent than in California where Bernie Sanders voters were likely robbed of a legitimate candidate—and they know how it happened and who is to blame.</p>

<p>Thousands of voters in the June 7, 2016&nbsp;California Primary election showed up at the polls across the state to discover their <a href="http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/KatyGrimes/1000/P30" rel="noopener noreferrer">political party registrations had been changed</a>, or dropped altogether… but only after they had received official sample ballots verifying their party registration in the mail. This only could have been done within the Secretary of State’s <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/votecal-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer">VoteCal</a> system.</p>
<h4><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2016/05/11/ca-purged-thousands-eligible-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence Shows “Democratic” California Purged Thousands of Eligible Voters</a></strong></h4>
<p>Hundreds of “dead voters” were uncovered in Southern California right before the June Primary, the majority of them in Los Angeles County. Some of these deceased voters have even been voting for years, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>Fraudulent dead voters are concerning, but <a href="http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/KatyGrimes/1000/P30" rel="noopener noreferrer">election and voter fraud</a> at the ballot box is an even bigger problem in close races.</p>

<p>After the June 7th&nbsp;primary, dead voters may be just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Thousands of Republican and Democratic voters reported to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electionintegrityproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election Integrity Project</a>&nbsp;that they arrived at their designated polling stations on June 7th&nbsp;to find that their party affiliation had been changed.&nbsp;Most reported being re-registered “No Party Preference,” California’s version of “Decline to State.” Others said their registrations were dropped, or they received the wrong ballot, which in many cases prevented them from voting for President in the primary.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electionintegrityproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election Integrity Project</a>’s Linda Paine said they noticed a pattern in several Southern California counties during Election Day. However, as the polls closed, Paine said they were contacted by large numbers of voters throughout the state upset that their party affiliation was changed, and had to vote using a provisional ballot.</p>

<h2><strong>Help From Congress</strong></h2>
<p>Paine and EIP have been calling on Congress to investigate since no state officials in the California Democrat echo chamber will. “Now they are listening,” Paine said after Trump’s announcement opening an investigation into election fraud.</p>

<p>“We are the forgotten men and women, who didn’t lose our manufacturing and business… we lost our voice in government,” Paine said.</p>

<p>If the voter rolls throughout the country were purged of dead voters, and voter I.D. laws were passed, the Democrats would lose millions of their voters. Photo I.D. is required for many things, so why is it only oppressive to minorities when it’s required to vote?</p>

<p>This electronic vote rigging indicates a massive fraud being perpetrated on California voters, as well as the American public. And in California, elected lawmakers are silent about the fraud, as is the media. It is now up to citizens to ensure that no more elections are stolen, like some Third World Banana Republic election.</p>
