<p>Unaffiliated voters and candidates&nbsp;alike have historically been overlooked by Illinois' election code.&nbsp;But this year, elections in Illinois may get a makeover. Legislators have introduced several bills in January, all aimed at reforming the Prairie State’s exclusionary elections.</p>
<h2><strong>Rep. Scott Drury: HB 0330</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/771266" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 0330</a>, sponsored by Rep. Scott Drury (D-Highwood), eliminates the requirement that voters declare a party in order to participate in primary elections. Under Rep. Drury’s bill, a voter is provided with all valid primary ballots and casts only the ballot of his or her choice.</p>

<p>Rep. Drury has been working on reform measures like HB 0330 for years. He says the goal is always to increase voter participation; especially, since voters are becoming increasingly put off from voting when they are forced to affiliate with a party.</p>
<blockquote>“If we open primaries it would increase participation” said Drury in an interview for IVN. “For me, increasing participation should always be the goal.”</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Rep. Mike Fortner: HB 0285</strong></h2>
<p>Another bill, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/771096" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 0285</a>, introduced by Rep. Mike Fortner (R-West Chicago), changes Illinois’ primary election system even further. Rep. Fortner’s bill institutes a nonpartisan, top-two primary. All candidates would appear on a single primary ballot and the top-two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.</p>

<p>Illinois' primary elections are currently administered via <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Voting_in_Illinois" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate</a> party ballots wherein only party-qualified candidates appear and the top vote-getter from each party primary advances to the general election.</p>

<h2><strong>Sen. Kyle McCarter: SB 0063</strong></h2>
<p>A third bill, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/772211" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 0063</a>, sponsored by State Senator Kyle McCarter (R-Lebanon), would effectively lower the signature requirement for independent candidates and&nbsp;align it with those imposed on political parties.</p>

<p>Independent candidates in&nbsp;Illinois are faced with a&nbsp;signature requirement in the tens of thousands in order to appear on the ballot. Whereas&nbsp;Republicans and Democrats typically only need less than 1,000 signatures to qualify.</p>

<p>The bill follows a district court <a href="http://static.news-gazette.com/news/local/2016-08-25/judge-backs-gills-bid-appear-ballot.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision</a> in August 2016 where David Gill, an independent candidate for Illinois’ 13th congressional district, filed suit against the state for denying him ballot access in&nbsp;the November general election. He argued successfully that the existing signature threshold was unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause.</p>

<p>The court ruled that there was no public interest in maintaining a large signature disparity for ballot access between established party candidates and independent candidates. However, Gill didn't appear on the November ballot as the district court's ruling was overturned on appeal.</p>

<p>Although the future of these election reform measures remains uncertain, a swell of similar bills are appearing&nbsp;across the country. The question remains as to whether or not partisan politics will prevail once more.</p>
