<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told Fox News' <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/03/assange-russian-government-not-source-wikileaks-emails.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Hannity</a> that neither the Russian government nor a state party gave WikiLeaks the emails taken from DNC officials and Hillary Clinton campaign chief&nbsp;John Podesta.</p>

<p>“We can say, we have said, repeatedly that over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party,” Assange said. Part one of the interview will air Tuesday night on Hannity's show.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of&nbsp;emails from Podesta and the DNC throughout the 2016 election cycle, exposing&nbsp;collusion between big-name&nbsp;reporters and the Clinton campaign, the Clinton camp receiving debate questions in advance, and DNC officials helping Clinton beat Bernie Sanders in the primary, among other things.</p>

<p>Assange also remarked on how curious it was that the name "WikiLeaks" remained out of reports&nbsp;and statements from the White House and other administration officials..</p>

<p>“It’s very strange,” he said.</p>

<p>Further Assange&nbsp;said he believes the Obama administration is "trying to delegitimize the Trump administration as it goes into the White House. They are trying to say that President-elect Trump is not a legitimate president.”</p>

<p>When asked if he thought the emails had an effect on the election's outcome, Assange said:</p>
<blockquote>“Who knows, it’s impossible to tell. But if it did, the accusation is that the true statements of Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, and the DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz, their true statements is what changed the election.”</blockquote>
<p>On Monday, WikiLeaks hinted at big year in 2017, even suggesting that it will be even bigger than 2016 and supporters should prepare for a "showdown." What that means exactly has yet to be revealed.</p>
