<p><strong>Tijuana, Mexico</strong> - The protests of Mexico’s gasoline price hike continued over the weekend at the main points of entry of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California.</p>

<p>U.S. authorities had to divert southbound traffic from Interstates 5 and 805.</p>

<p>It took hours to get traffic back to a regular flow.</p>

<p>The total number of demonstrators was estimated at close to 15,000.</p>

<p>A group of more than&nbsp;40,000 protested at the Civic Center in Mexicali, Baja California’s state capital. Protesters managed to block both entrances and exits to the main state government office building and to a federal office building. There was wide-ranging dissatisfaction with Mexico’s political and economic status quo, and demanded change.</p>
