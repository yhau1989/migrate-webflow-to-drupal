<p>The Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Protection San Diego, showed off eight wall prototypes near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry.</p>

<p>The prototypes, four made of concrete and four made of other materials, began construction last month and were expected to be completed within 30 days. The prototypes are expected to cost nearly $4 million.&nbsp; Six companies are taking part in the construction of their prototypes.</p>

<div>Showing the prototypes comes at an interesting time as&nbsp;delegates of the United States and Mexico, along with Canada, are gathering for another negotiating round of<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/nafta-talks-focus-on-procurement-amid-doubts-over-deal-chances-idUSKBN1CH2EO?il=0" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NAFTA</a>.</div>

<div>The prototypes are between 18 and 30 feet high and are obviously designed to deter illegal crossings.</div>

<p>While President Trump has made the border wall one of his top priorties, and a huge focus of his campaign, Congress will still have to approve the funding.</p>
<p>Testing the prototypes will begin shortly to determine which one will work best to secure the border.</p>
