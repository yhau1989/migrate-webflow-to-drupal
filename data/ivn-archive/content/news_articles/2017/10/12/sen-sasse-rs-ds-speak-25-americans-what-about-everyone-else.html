<p>Republican US Sen. <strong>Ben Sasse</strong> (R-Neb.) responded to a tweet from President Donald Trump over the weekend, in which the president called out the "one-sided coverage" in the media:</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/BenSasse/status/916721683800629248</p>

<p>Sasse raises an important point. It is not just a one-sided narrative, as the president suggests. The current national narrative is dominated by two private political corporations that only speak to less than a quarter of the voting population.</p>

<p>The rhetoric has gotten so divisive, so extreme because the anti-competitive framework of US elections -- <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">party primaries</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ballot-access" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictive ballot access laws</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gerrymandering" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme partisan gerrymandering</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/commission-on-presidential-debates" rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive debate rules</a> -- enables the Republican and Democratic Parties to only have to speak to the most partisan members of their bases.</p>

<p>And here is the thing: the bases for both political parties are shrinking, which means the us-vs-them, uncompromising, hyperbolic language on both sides is not only getting worse, it is speaking to a smaller and smaller percentage of Americans.</p>

<p>This was covered in a recent paper by ASU Morrison Institute for Public Policy, USC Schwarzenegger Institute, and Independent Voting, called <em><a href="https://ivn.us/2017/10/04/gamechangers-usc-asu-independent-voting-partner-challenge-two-party-academia/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamechangers? Independent Voters May Rewrite the Political Playbook</a>.&nbsp;</em>Political academia, pollsters, consultants, and the media have kept the national political discussion locked in 1950s, red vs. blue politics.</p>

<p>"That long-held duo control is becoming more tenuous, however, as more voters disassociate themselves with polarizing partisanship and constricting party lines by joining the independent movement â€” either by action, name or both," said Joseph Garcia, director of communication and community impact for the Morrison Institute for Public Policy, and director of its Latino Public Policy Center.</p>

<p>Most Americans are not represented in the US's political infrastructure -- whether we are talking about Congress, on the campaign trail, national polling, or in the media.</p>

<p>That is why papers like&nbsp;<em>Gamechangers</em>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/09/20/harvard-study-two-party-duopoly-blame-government-dysfunction/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study from the Harvard Business School</a> that explains just how much the two-party duopoly has crippled competitive elections are so important.</p>
