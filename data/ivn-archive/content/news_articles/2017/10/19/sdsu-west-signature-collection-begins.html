searchTitle: SDSU West Signature Collection To Begin Saturday
-->
<p>SDSU’s annual homecoming football game is set for this Saturday, October 21 at SDCCU stadium.</p>

<p>The game will feature the Aztecs taking on the Fresno State University Bulldogs. The "Battle for the Old Oil Can" game will also be the backdrop for the signature collection phase for SDSU West.</p>

<p>So, if you're attending the game, you'll likely be asked for your signature while tailgating.</p>

<p><strong>"FRIENDS OF SDSU" EFFORT</strong></p>

<p>The “Friends of SDSU” proposal for Mission Valley must collect the necessary signatures to make the ballot for November 2018. The goal is to get more than 100,000 City of San Diego residents to sign on to the deal that could bring a new stadium to Mission Valley as well as higher-education expansion for the university.</p>

<p>According to the sources close to the efforts, the "Friends of SDSU" have raised well over a $1 million dollars for their signature gathering campaign.</p>

<p>If the effort is successful, the city would have to grant a lease extension at SDCCU Stadium past 2018 since a new Aztecs stadium probably wouldn’t be ready, until at least 2022.</p>

<p><strong>SOCCER CITY</strong></p>

<p>Of course this plan will be another option for voters to consider along with the Soccer City effort put forward by FS Investors.&nbsp;That plan, supported by the Mayor's office, would be more a classic developer-style effort, with a stadium ready to support an MLS franchise.</p>

<p>SDSU Athletic Director John Wicker has recently said SDSU has had “no discussions” with the Soccer City group. In his first news conference as Athletic Director, Wicker said a stadium within campus expansion was his top priority.</p>

<p>The university has hired the firm Populous for its stadium design. Wicker noted the university should have renderings and cost projections by December 1st and at that time, would provide a clearer understanding of how the stadium fits into a master plan for campus expansion.</p>

<p>It also will coincide with the signature gathering effort results.</p>
