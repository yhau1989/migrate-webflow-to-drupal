<p>The first official debate between the top four&nbsp;Democrats&nbsp;running for California governor took place in Anaheim over the weekend.</p>

<p>The event was hosted by the National Union of Healthcare Workers and fittingly, the only issue the candidates had significant disagreements on, was healthcare.</p>

<p>John Chiang, Anthonio Villaraigosa, Delaine Eastin and Gavin Newsom debated affordable housing, immigration and Washington D.C., among other issues.</p>

<p><strong>VILLARAIGOSA "NO PIE IN THE SKY"</strong></p>

<p>Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Mayor of Los Angeles, said he supports the concept of a state single-payer system, but probably not at the current cost that healthcare paradigm brings.</p>

<p>The estimated costs for single-payer are anywhere between $330 billion and $450 billion annually.</p>

<p>Villaraigosa said, “You can’t just say I want pie in the sky, because that doesn’t put food on people’s tables.”</p>

<p><strong>NEWSOM "SINGLE-PAYER IS THE WAY"</strong></p>

<p>Lt. Gov.&nbsp;Gavin Newsom dismissed Villaraigosa and his budget concerns.</p>

<p>Newsom cited a UCLA study that found Californians already pay roughly $367.5 billion for healthcare through private insurance and public programs.</p>

<p>Newsom said, "The fact is the money exists in the system. The money is not being well invested. A single-payer system provides the ability to provide more efficiency and more cost controls … I’m not going to wait around for the debate to unfold in Washington, D.C.”</p>

<p><strong>EASTIN AND CHIANG FAVOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES</strong></p>

<p>Former state schools chief Delanie Eastin noted she supports single-payer but couldn't clearly define how taxpayers would pay for it. Eastin said, “I’m not sure exactly. But it’s doable."</p>

<p>State Treasurer&nbsp;John Chiang&nbsp;also favors universal healthcare, but suggests a slower approach would be the responsible path. Chiang said, "We don’t have to go all in and provide all the services at once.”</p>

<p>According to those who attended the debate, Newsom and Eastin fared the best.</p>
