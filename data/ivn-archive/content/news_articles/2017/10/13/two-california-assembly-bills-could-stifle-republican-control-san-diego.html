searchTitle: Two California Assembly Bills Could Stiffle Republican Control of San Diego
-->
<p>California Governor Jerry Brown signed two bills Thursday that will give San Diego County voters greater control in county elections.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB801" rel="noopener noreferrer">AB 801</a></strong> restructures the county's Independent Redistricting Commission by creating a representative 14-member commission that is not solely comprised of retired judges like the current commission's structure requires. It will now be a bipartisan panel representing all 5 supervisorial districts.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="San Diego voters can now ensure all county elections are decided when the greatest number of voters participate." hyperlink="https://ivn.us/2017/10/13/two-california-assembly-bills-could-stifle-republican-control-san-diego/" handle="" hashes=""]

<p>The bill will affect the redistricting process after the 2020 decennial census, and will impact the lines drawn for the 2022 election cycle.</p>

<p>The other bill, <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/03/16/asm-todd-gloria-proposes-top-two-san-diego-county-board-supervisors/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AB 901</strong></a>, allows San Diego voters to amend the county charter to require all San Diego County elections to have a November election, even if a candidate gets over 50 percent of the vote in the June primary. This would ensure that all county elections are decided when the greatest number of voters participate.</p>

<p>Voter turnout typically doubles in November, when compared to the primary turnout in June.</p>

<p>Here are some stats offered by the <strong><a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a></strong>:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>2012 voter turnout - 37.43% in the primary, 76.98% in the general election</li>
 	<li>2014 voter turnout - 27.23% in the primary, 44.76% in the general election</li>
 	<li>2016 voter turnout - 50.94% in the primary, 81.48% in the general election</li>
</ul>
<p>AB 801 and 901 were <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/letter_of_support_for_san_diego_county_top_two_primary_bill_ab_901" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported by the Independent Voter Project</a>. The group also backed successful election reform initiatives for the City of San Diego in 2016 (<a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/09/measures-k-l-san-diego-city-elections-reformed-historic-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measures K &amp; L</a>) to require that all city elections have a November election and city ballot initiatives must appear on the November ballot. This means San Diego voters will make the greatest decisions affecting their city when the most voters participate.</p>

<p>Now, voters have an opportunity to do the same at the county level. A ballot initiative to amend the city charter to require November elections could go before voters as early as next year.</p>
