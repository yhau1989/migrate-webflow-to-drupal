<p>Independent candidate Terry Hayes officially launched her clean elections campaign for the governor's seat in Maine Monday. Hayes was joined by family, friends, and supporters as she made her announcement during press conferences in Portland and Bangor.</p>

<p>“I am running as an independent, clean elections candidate for Governor because I choose to be beholden to the Maine people, and not to party leaders, wealthy donors, and special interests,” said Terry. “I have the experience, independence, and courage to lead Maine in a bold new direction.”</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="As Governor, I will lead with integrity and respect, giving Maine citizens more voice and more choice in our democracy, making government more transparent and accountable to the people..." author="Terry Hayes, Independent Maine gubernatorial candidate"]

<p>Hayes currently serves as the state's first independent state treasurer, selected by state lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle. She was also a member of the state House from 2006 to 2014, serving the constituents of&nbsp;Buckfield, Hartford, Sumner, and Paris.</p>

<p>According to a press release sent out Monday, Hayes' campaign was the first one to release its list of major endorsements, which include independents, Republicans, and Democrats.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Rep. Denise Harlow (I-Portland)</li>
 	<li>Hon. Andrea Boland (D-Sanford)</li>
 	<li>Hon. Les Fossel (R-Alna)</li>
 	<li>Hon. Bryan Kaenrath (D-Gouldsboro)</li>
 	<li>Hon. Stan Short (I-Pittsfield)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other notable endorsements include <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/24/centrist-project-announces-first-independent-endorsement-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Centrist Project</a> and former Republican State Representative&nbsp;Les Fossel.</p>

<p>Hayes has promised to put the people of Maine over party leaders and special interests, saying her policy positions are based on pragmatic problem solving rather than ideology.</p>

<p>“There are good people in Augusta who care deeply about our state and who want to solve problems, but they are stuck in a paradigm that rewards partisanship,” says Hayes.</p>
<p><em>“The rules governing our democracy have been written by the powerful to maintain their privilege at the expense of Maine people. As Governor, I will lead with integrity and respect, giving Maine citizens more voice and more choice in our democracy, making government more transparent and accountable to the people, and inviting and encouraging partnership, not partisanship.”</em></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballotpedia</a>, there are currently 11 declared Democrats and 3 declared Republicans for the race. Republican Governor Paul LePage cannot seek re-election as he has been term limited out, opening the door for an independent candidate to rise.</p>
