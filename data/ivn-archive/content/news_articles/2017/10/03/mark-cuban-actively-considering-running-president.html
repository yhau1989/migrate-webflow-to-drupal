<p>Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said Tuesday that he is actively considering running for president.</p>

<p>"Based off what is happening in the White House, based on what is happening in the country and the world, I think we need better leadership," Cuban said. "I think I could do a better job."</p>

<p>Right now, Cuban says though he is thinking about it, the odds are slim he will launch a presidential campaign, joking that his wife would divorce him.</p>

<p>Still, he added, "Who knows what happens in the next 3 plus years, right?"</p>

<p>He says if a candidate steps up that he thinks will do a better job, then great. However, there is no denying that Cuban would make an interesting presidential candidate, and he would be an independent candidate.</p>
