<p>Eighteen attorneys general were anticipating this day in court. The day they believed a judge would strike down the Trump administration's order denying payment of Obamacare subsidies.</p>

<p>The payments from the federal government had kept health care costs down and affordable for low-income families. However, the US District Court Judge ruled in favor of the Trump administration, paving the way for skyrocketing Obamacare premiums next year.</p>

<p><em>Judge Vince Chhabria</em></p>

<p>Judge Vince Chhabria of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, a Barack Obama appointee, heard oral arguments on the case this week.</p>

<p>Chhabria questioned whether the states showed the "immediate" harm necessary for him to issue a nationwide injunction. He also suggested many of the states had fair warning this action could happen.</p>

<p>“It appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument,”&nbsp;wrote Chhabria.</p>

<p>The Trump administration terminated the payments to insurers earlier this month, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office noted the proposal would cut the US deficit by at least $3.8 billion over the next decade, although that number has been disputed as being low.</p>

<p>According to congressional analysts, the subsidies were amounting to nearly $600 million a month. They were due to cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to grow to $10 billion for 2018.</p>
<h2><strong>California Leads The Resistance&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that Trump’s decision will force low-income families off health care coverage.</p>

<p>“Without an emergency order halting the Trump action, swift action in this litigation becomes even more compelling," he said.</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Patty Murray from Washington said “this ruling only makes it more critical” that the Senate pass a bipartisan agreement that would authorize the subsidies.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Ready for the Obamacare Spike</strong></h2>
<p>Provided Congress doesn't act, it's very likely we are going to see large price spikes in Obamacare plans across the country beginning in 2018.</p>

<p>Premiums for Obamacare “silver” plans, generally the most popular type of health insurance plan on the individual health insurance market, are expected to rise 34 percent on average in 2018.</p>

<p>In California, a state that has the largest number of individuals in the marketplace, premiums are reportedly going to rise by 38% for some plans, and California is considered to be one of, if not the cheapest Obamacare marketplaces.</p>
