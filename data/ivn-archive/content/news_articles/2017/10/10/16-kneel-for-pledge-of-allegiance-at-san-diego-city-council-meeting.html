-->
<p>On the same day NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell <a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/Statement-From-NFL-Commissioner-Roger-Goodell.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement </a>asking all players, owners and coaches to not kneel for the national anthem before games, 16 people took a knee for the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of the San Diego City Council meeting on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The protest elicited no comment from councilmembers.</p>

<p>Rev. Shane Harris, one of those who took a knee said to reporters,"You look around the country at the racial divide, it's a huge issue."</p>

<p>Harris, who is with the the San Diego chapter of the National Action Network, is also part of a coalition demanding Republican City Councilman Chris Cate resign following a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/10/03/soccer-city-councilman-chris-cate-admits-releasing-confidential-memo/" rel="noopener noreferrer">confidential memo scandal</a>, as reported on IVN San Diego.</p>

<p>Harris said the group's protest also aimed to support Raymond Wylie, a 67-year-old man who has filed a claim against the city for an arrest he said was racially motivated. Wylie told reporters he was arrested on suspicion of carrying a lead pipe and burglary during a morning walk last July.</p>

<p>He said he spent nearly 24 hours behind bars but was never actually charged.</p>
