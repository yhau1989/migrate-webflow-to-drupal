searchTitle: San Diego Fire-Rescue Department Sends Strike Teams To Napa
-->
<p>Following an emergency declaration from Governor Jerry Brown, the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department has sent two strike teams to Northern California to assist in battling the wildland brush fires that are devastating the region.</p>
<p>Monica Munoz, spokeswoman for the department said, "We received a request to send two Strike teams to Napa. They will leave today (Monday). We backfill their work shifts with overtime staff so there is no change to the level of service for San Diegans."</p>
<p>San Diego Cal Fire resources are also loading up to deploy.</p>
<p>More than a dozen wildfires have ravaged Northern California for another day. At least 23 people have been killed and more than 20,000 people have been evacuated.</p>

<div>The largest fires were burning in California's wine country destinations -- Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties.</div>
