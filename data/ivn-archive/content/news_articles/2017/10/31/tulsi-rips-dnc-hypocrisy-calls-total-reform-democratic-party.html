<p>US Rep. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/tulsi-gabbard" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong></a> released a video Monday, where she ripped the DNC for not doing anything to fix the problems exposed during the 2016 election. Despite widespread calls for reform within the party, Tulsi says the DNC leaders have instead ousted those who did not completely toe the party line.</p>

<p>"Recently, the DNC chair -- claiming diversity -- removed a number of people from the party's executive committee, including Jim Zogby, the only Arab-American, while allowing lobbyists and consultants to keep their position," Gabbard says.</p>

<p>She said that all the people removed had one thing in common: "They either supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, supported Keith Ellison for DNC chair, or both."</p>

<p>"The DNC's move to cast out those who just haven't fallen in line with the establishment, and who were actually demanding real reforms, is destined for failure. We must make sure our voices are heard now as we fight for a new path forward that is more inclusive and strengthens our democracy," Gabbard adds.</p>

<p>Reforms she proposes include:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Getting rid of superdelegates;</li>
 	<li>Open, same-day registration; and</li>
 	<li>Putting people over profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>"We must put people over profits, and progress over special interests," Gabbard says. "Now, we can't do this if you've got just a few power brokers making deals in a back room. We can't do this with a closed process or with superdelegates that can swing an election."</p>
