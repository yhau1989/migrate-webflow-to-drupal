<p>The voters of Santa Fe, New Mexico, passed a ballot measure in 2008 saying the city should use ranked choice voting in city elections. The city still hasnâ€™t implemented it.</p>

<p>The supporters of ranked choice voting sued the city in the State Supreme Court last month, but that court refused to hear the case.</p>

<p>In response, the supporters of RCV have refiled their case in lower state court. The lower state court must hear the case.
