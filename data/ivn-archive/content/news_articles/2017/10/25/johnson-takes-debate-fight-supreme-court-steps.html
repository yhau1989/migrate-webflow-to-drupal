<p>Gary Johnson and Jill Stein plan to file a cert petition with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 26 in <em>Johnson v. Commission on Presidential Debates</em>. On the same day, Johnson will hold a rally on the steps of the Court.</p>

<p>This case should not be confused with <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/level-the-playing-field" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Level the Playing Field v FEC</em></a>, which is still in U.S. District Court. Both cases challenge the presidential debate exclusion, but the two cases depend on different legal theories.</p>
