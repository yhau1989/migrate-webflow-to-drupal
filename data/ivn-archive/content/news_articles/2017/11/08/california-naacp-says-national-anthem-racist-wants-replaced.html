<p>Attempting to capitalize on the controversy surrounding the National Anthem and the National Football League, the California chapter of the NAACP is seeking the support of California lawmakers to remove the “The Star-Spangled Banner” as the national anthem completely.</p>

<p>California NAACP President Alice Huffman drafted the NAACP’s resolutions after President Donald Trump&nbsp;suggested NFL owners should fire&nbsp;any player who doesn’t stand for the anthem.</p>

<p>The NAACP are now circulating two resolutions in Sacramento that passed at its state conference in October. The first urges Congress to rescind “one of the most racist, pro-slavery, anti-black songs in the American lexicon” as the national anthem.</p>

<p>The second resolution relates to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick began the kneeling protests that were seen across the NFL as a message against police brutality.</p>

<p>The second resolution specifically asks Congress to censure Trump for his remarks and demands that an NFL team hire Kaepernick. California NAACP President Alice Huffman said. “We owe a lot of it to Kaepernick. I think all this controversy about the knee will go away once the song is removed.”</p>

<p>Congress adopted “The Star-Spangled Banner” in 1931. Huffman said, "We should find a replacement that is not another song that disenfranchises part of the American population.”</p>
