searchTitle: Petition Gathering Begins to Restore Maine Ranked Choice Voting
-->
<p>On Monday, Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap approved the petition form for supporters of ranked choice voting to use, to repeal the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/10/23/voters-betrayed-maine-lawmakers-set-ranked-choice-voting-repeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-ranked-choice bill</a> that the legislature passed last month. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/11/06/ranked-choice-voting-supporters-to-begin-peoples-veto-campaign-tuesday/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this story</a>.</p>

<p>The referendum petition needs 61,123 valid signatures by early February 2018. If the petition succeeds, the law passed last month is suspended, and the state will be obliged to use <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a> for the June 2018 primary for all federal and state office.</p>
