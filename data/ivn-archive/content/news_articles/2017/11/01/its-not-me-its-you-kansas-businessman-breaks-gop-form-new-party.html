<p>Kansas businessman Scott Morgan has <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/weblogs/capitol-report/2017/oct/31/lawrence-businessman-writes-breakup-lett/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced that he is hoping to organize a new party</a>, for Kansas, to be called “<a href="http://www.partyofthecenter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Party of the Center</a>.” He will try to get it on the 2018 ballot.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.partyofthecenter.org/dear-gop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan's announcement</a>:</p>
<p><em>This is hard to write but I think we shouldn’t hang out together anymore. I’d like to say it’s not you, it’s me. But I kind of think it is you. I know that’s harsh but you’ve changed and I just feel we’re going in different directions.</em>

<em>I can’t think this is a big surprise. You actually asked me to move out when I rudely ran against your BFF Kris Kobach in the Republican primary. He issued a press release saying I wasn’t a “real” Republican so I should leave the party. You didn’t exactly stand up for me.</em>

<em>Now you’re on a bender with some billionaire named Donald. I mean, he’s what you’re looking for? What part of your beloved values do you find in that guy? How am I supposed to compete with that? I’m not even sure what “that” is.</em></p>
<p><strong>Read the full "break up" letter and announcement&nbsp;<a href="http://www.partyofthecenter.org/dear-gop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Kansas formerly had a law saying a party could only have one word in its name, but the Natural Law Party sued Kansas in 2000 to overturn this law, and the state conceded it could not defend the law, and repealed it.</p>
