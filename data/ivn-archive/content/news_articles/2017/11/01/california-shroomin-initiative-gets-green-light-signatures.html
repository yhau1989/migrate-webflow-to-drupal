<p>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla sent out a press release Wednesday announcing that a new initiative has been approved for petition gathering, one that would decriminalize the use, possession, sale, transport, and cultivation of psilocybin.</p>

<p>What is psilocybin? It's the psychedelic compound found in various species of mushrooms.</p>

<p>That's right, if the campaign to get this initiative passed gets&nbsp;365,880 signatures from registered California voters in 180 days, Californians will have a chance to add psychedelic mushrooms to the list of drugs that have been decriminalized in the state.</p>

<p>Next year may be a wild year for ballot initiatives in California. One campaign wants California to secede from the union. Another campaign wants to break California up into three states. This one wants to further break down prohibition on certain illegal substances.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
