<p>Stephen Erickson joins host T.J. O'Hara on this week's podcast to discuss his latest book, "What Would Madison Do? The Political Journey Progressives and Conservatives Must Make Together."</p>



<p>The two delve into key issues raised in the book, the parallels between the challenges Madison faced and those in the present political climate, as well as Erickson's experience in the political realm and the insight he provides into a partisan system.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/author/stephenerickson/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Erickson</a> is the author of&nbsp;"What Would Madison Do?" probably the only political book in America today praised by leading voices on the Left AND Right. Beginning as Resident Scholar at US Term Limits in the 1990s, he has worked for years on political reform. Trained as an historian, Erickson is also co-author of the critically acclaimed history book, "Boon Island: A True Story of Mutiny, Shipwreck and Cannibalism."</p>
