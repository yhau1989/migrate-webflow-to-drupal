<p>US Sens. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong> (I-Vt.) and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a></strong> (R-Texas) took part in another CNN debate on tax reform Tuesday.</p>

<p>This time, they were joined by Sens. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) and Maria Cantwell (D- Washington). The debate was hosted by CNN personalities Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.</p>

<p>Scott and Cantwell got their time in the debate, but the focus seemed to be on the "headliners," Cruz and Sanders. Both senators have taken to the CNN debate stage multiple times now.</p>

<p>Bernie argues that Republicans won't work with Democrats. Cruz argues Democrats won't work with Republicans.</p>

<p>Cruz says, "If you're a taxpayer, this bill benefits you." He argues for tax cuts for all, which he says will lead to economic growth.</p>

<p>Sanders says Cruz, other Republicans, and the president are misleading the public on what the bill actually does. He says the GOP's tax reform bills "give the lion's share of tax breaks to the top one percent."</p>

<p>The Senate bill will likely be voted on the floor soon.</p>
