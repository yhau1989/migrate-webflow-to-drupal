<p>A new poll conducted by the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times finds a growing number of Californian's opposed to the Gas Tax passed by the Democrat dominated legislature in Sacramento.</p>

<p>When voters were asked if the vote happened today, 54.2% said they would cancel the&nbsp;tax and fee hikes.&nbsp;45.8% said they would vote to keep the increases in place.</p>

<p>Two groups are working to put initiatives on the November 2018 ballot. If passed, the vote would repeal the 12-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase that took effect this month.</p>

<p>Robert Shrum is the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. Schrum said, “Put to a popular vote, the gas tax for infrastructure is in trouble. I certainly would not want to start out at 47% support if I was in favor of this and there was a ballot measure.</p>

<p>It might also point to a larger problem for democrats in Sacramento.</p>

<p><strong>BY THE NUMBERS</strong></p>

<p>Opposition to the Gas Tax is strongest among Republicans — 74.6% wanted to cancel the tax increase and fees, according to Jill Darling, the poll survey director.</p>

<p>The gas tax increase is supported by 55% of Democrats.</p>

<p>The poll&nbsp;was conducted&nbsp;among 1,504 eligible voters. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</p>

<p><strong>RACE FOR GOVERNOR</strong></p>

<p>As for the race to replace Governor Jerry Brown, Democrat Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is currently leading the race to replace termed-out Brown, with 24.5 percent support.</p>

<p>The race has narrowed with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, at 16.3 percent. And importantly, virtually unknown before he became a vocal proponent of the&nbsp;gas tax repeal, Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach) has 11.8 percent.</p>
