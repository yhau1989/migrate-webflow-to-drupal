<p>The stadium portion is expected to cost close to $250 million.</p>
<p>SDSU President Sally Roush said the stadium would be funded by bonds, and repaid from stadium revenues. At the event Roush said, "Our vision, is a world class campus, research center and stadium venue. Our goal is a top 25 program to help focus attention on our scholastic achievements and research facilities."</p>
<p><strong>PETCO PARK BUILDERS ENGAGED AGAIN</strong></p>
<p>By all accounts Petco Park has been a huge success for San Diego.</p>
<p>The firm behind the ballpark, Populous, is now leading the vision and design for the proposed "Aztecs Stadium."</p>
<p>Scott Radecic is one of the founders and a senior principal with Populous. At the event at SDCCU stadium, Radecic said, "We've been working for three months on turning a <a href="https://twitter.com/GoAztecs/status/936339438451298304/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer">vision into reality</a>, this will be a 35,000 seat facility expandable to 55,000 for MLS and NFL, should they choose to come back to San Diego."</p>

<p>The stadium is included in the first phase of development and would take two years to build, JMI Realty CEO John Kratzer said.</p>
<p>Radecic says Populous intends to do with Aztecs Stadium, what they did with Petco Park's iconic sight lines and open space concourses. The colors and feel would be authentic to the City of San Diego and its weather, beaches and lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>SDSU ATHLETIC DIRECTOR LEADS THE CHARGE</strong></p>
<p>The 35,000-seat Aztec Stadium is included in the first phase of development and would take two years to build, JMI Realty CEO John Kratzer said. It would be funded by bonds that would be paid off with future revenues from the facility.<img alt="" height="735" src="cloudinary://sdsu-unveils-stadium-vision-mission-valley-68069.jpg" width="2205"></p>

<p><em>Aztecs Stadium Rendering</em></p>

<p>Renderings and a computer-animated video showed a two-level stadium topped by a canopy.&nbsp;A wide ground-level concourse would include 18 "garden room'' areas of different styles that would be open for public use when there are no events.</p>

<p>Athletic Director John David Wicker said,&nbsp;"A stadium that will have the ability to host concerts, other professional sporting events, NCAA championships, tractor pulls -- you name it, we'll host it,'' he said. "Our goal is to build a stadium that will host events that reach every San Diegan.''</p>

<p>Wicker continued, "Our goal is to create a great experience for our students, and we realize that just providing some seats does not meet that need. We'll work with our student leaders on campus to build out an area that they can truly call their own.''</p>

<p><strong>SIGNATURE COLLECTION CONTINUES</strong></p>

<p>The signature collection portion of the effort continues and officials say they are pleased with the progress they are making.</p>

<p>The likelihood is that SDSU Mission Valley and the FS Investors Soccer City initiatives will be on the same ballot in November 2018.</p>
