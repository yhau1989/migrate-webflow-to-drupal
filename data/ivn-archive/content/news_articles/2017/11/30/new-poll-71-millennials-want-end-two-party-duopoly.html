searchTitle: 71% of Millennials Want to End Two-Party Duopoly
-->
<p>It's no secret that the Millennial generation is the most politically independent generation in the US. Pew Research found in <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/07/6-new-findings-about-millennials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2014</a> that half of Millennials consider themselves independent of the Republican and Democratic Parties, and the number hasn't gone down since.</p>

<p>Most Millennials don't only consider themselves independent of the two major political parties, they want to break up the two-party duopoly as well. According to a recent <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/millennial-poll-strong-majority-want-third-political-party-n824526" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News/GenForward poll</a>, 71% of Millennials think the two parties are not doing an adequate job and a third party is needed.</p>

<p>The results of the survey were released only a couple months after a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/millennial-poll-strong-majority-want-third-political-party-n824526" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll</a> found that 61 percent of all likely US voters believe the same -- a record high. It is easy to see how Millennials are a key driver of this trend.</p>

<p>Here are some key findings of the NBC News/GenForward poll:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>6 in 10 respondents disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job;</li>
 	<li>59 percent have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, and 42 percent have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party;</li>
 	<li>8 in 10 white, male respondents said a third party was needed -- the most of any specific race and gender demographic in the Millennial generation;</li>
 	<li>74 percent of independent Millennials said a third party is needed; while</li>
 	<li>75 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners, and 67 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners said the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could make for an interesting midterm election as a record number of third party and independent candidates run for elected office, and the number of representation outside of the two-party duopoly continues to grow.</p>
