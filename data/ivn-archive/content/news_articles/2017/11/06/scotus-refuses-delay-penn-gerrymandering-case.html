<p>On November 3, Justice Samuel Alito refused a request by Pennsylvania state officials to delay a trial in <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/16/coalition-sues-pennsylvania-partisan-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania v Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</em></a>. That case, filed in Commonwealth Court, seeks a ruling that Pennsylvaniaâ€™s U.S. House district boundaries are an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.</p>

<p>The state government wanted to suspend the trial that is set for December. The state government said in case the U.S. Supreme Court later rules in the Wisconsin case that partisan gerrymandering is constitutional, the trial would be a waste of time.</p>

<p>See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-pennsylvania-redistricting-lawsuit-20171105-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">this story</a>. Because Justice Alito refused to stop the Pennsylvania trial, it will proceed next month.</p>
