<p>There are some Alabama voters who are considering writing in a candidate in the upcoming special Senate election. These voters are concerned about&nbsp;multiple allegations that GOP candidate Roy Moore sexually harassed and abused minors when he was a local district attorney.</p>

<p>But there is something voters should know about how write-in campaigns work in Alabama. Write-in campaigns are already a long shot, but voters could be dissuaded even more when they are faced with the reality that their vote <a href="http://www.waaytv.com/content/news/Write-in-votes-are-only-counted-if-they-could-impact-election-458090593.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">may not even be counted</a>.</p>

<p>State law says write-in ballots are only counted if it is determined that they could make a difference in the election. If the number of write-in ballots cast exceeds the difference between the two major party candidates, the secretary of state could ask that the ballots be counted.</p>

<p>Democrats are salivating at the prospect that they could weaken the Republican Party's majority in the Senate in a race that was all, but safe for the Republican candidate. But it might not be so easy as state law forces voters to choose between the Republican and Democrat on the ticket out of fear their vote won't count any other way.</p>

<p>Despite calls from the establishment wing in the national party, Roy Moore has remained defiant. He will not drop out of the race, and rejects the accusations against him -- calling them an attack on his Christian, conservative ideals.</p>

<p>And while national Republicans are asking him to drop out -- even thinking of ways to salvage the seat like <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/roy-moore-republicans-alabama-senate-244961" rel="noopener noreferrer">asking Luther Strange to resign to trigger <em>another</em> special election</a> (can't make that up), Moore has the <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/360813-alabama-gop-rebuffs-calls-to-abandon-roy-moore" rel="noopener noreferrer">continued support of the state party</a>. He also maintains support from his biggest fans:</p>

<p>Public opinion polls are of little help to forecast the race. The <a href="https://andersonrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/111617_complete_nov_AL_topline_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest Fox News poll</a>&nbsp;has Democrat Doug Jones leading by 8 points, while other polls have Roy Moore still leading by as much as <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d83bc45f4839ff4fb96bb8b8/files/993dd909-e98c-43f3-88e4-74f0deb686c7/ECP_PR_Alabama_11.13.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 points</a>. The election is scheduled for December 12.</p>
