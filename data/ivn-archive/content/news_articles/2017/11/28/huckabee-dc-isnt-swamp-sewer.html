<p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee blasted Republican US Sen. Bob Corker and other GOP lawmakers who are refusing to get behind their own party's tax reform plan during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends Tuesday. He said that while some lawmakers say they are trying to get to "yes," they are really trying to "gum up the works" by suggesting that the current efforts behind tax reform are not going to work and grow the economy.</p>

<p>He was then prompted to discuss Trump's promise to "drain a swamp" when there appeared to be plenty of swamp still there. Huckabee responded:</p>
<p><em>"Well, what I’ve said is it’s not a swamp. Swamps have ecological value. What we’re dealing with is a sewer. It’s more about flushing the sewer than it is about draining the swamp. And what we see in Washington every day is an attempt to do everything possible to prohibit and prevent this president from getting done the things that he went to Washington to do. And a big reason they’re resisting it is because it involves blowing up some of the wonderful cushioned environment in which they live, but at the expense of American workers. And that’s what has to change."</em></p>
<p>What do you think? Do you agree with Gov. Huckabee?</p>
