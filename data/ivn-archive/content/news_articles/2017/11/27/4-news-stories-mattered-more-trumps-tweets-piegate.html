<p>Read our centrist recap for the week below. We shine a light on the spin and useless stories from the Left and Right and detail what you should focus on, before people can pull wool over your eyes.</p>
<h3>What the&nbsp;<em>partisans</em>&nbsp;will focus on:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>President Trump recently released the following tweet about&nbsp;<strong>Time Magazine’s Person of the Year</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/934189999045693441</p>
<p>And many partisans on the Left went berserk. Regardless of whether Time Magazine called or not, President Trump is currently listed as one of the (many – 33 in all) options for Person of the Year. Note for the Right: the Person of the Year is for those who’ve had the most impact, not necessarily in a positive way, on the news. Time defines the title as given to “a person (or people) who has had the most influence over the news in the last 12 months.” So it’s not necessarily an award, it’s more an acknowledgement. Therefore, whether President Trump is in the running, or wins it, it doesn’t have much affect on politics and thus, unlike our partisan friends, you should ignore it.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Well folks, this is one we can’t believe we have to write. This is pretty low for our major “journalism” companies. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted a photo of a pie saying she baked it for her family. I can’t believe I’m about to write this…Well, a political analyst for CNN, that means she’s an adult, tweeted back that she believed the pie to be a stock image and fake, and thus wanted Ms. Sanders to prove it. Wait, it gets better. After all this ridiculousness, Fox News actually spent the time and money to not only write an article but also spend air-time discussing this charade. And, it was such an important topic, it was listed in two categories on their website. This is embarrassing for CNN and Fox News, debating the validity of a pie tweet. Please ignore this, please, we beg you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>should focus on:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The<b>&nbsp;Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a draft order to repeal many regulations currently protecting “Net&nbsp;Neutrality” that they’ll vote on December 14th.&nbsp;</b>For a good look at what “net neutrality” is, and what being for it or against it means, check out this article by dummies.com: <a href="http://www.dummies.com/education/internet-basics/understanding-net-neutrality/" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Understanding Net Neutrality”</a>. The “net neutrality” fight has been quite the contentious issue in the political world for some time now, and it hasn’t been without controversy. The FCC did a sensing session with the public in which people could post comments for or against, and&nbsp;<a href="http://fortune.com/2017/11/25/1-million-fake-fcc-comments-net-neutrality-were-probably-fake/" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s suspected that over one million of the “against” comments were fake.</a>&nbsp;You should definitely focus on this issue. Read about it, decide which side you’re on (If you fear corporations abuse power for profit, fear censorship, and like the freedom of paying one price for all content at the same traffic speeds, then you’re probably FOR. If you think regulations stifle innovation and fear the extreme growth of internet traffic will cause issues for the infrastructure, then you’re probably AGAINST), then help that side. This is an issue that will affect every single one of us for decades to come.</li>
 	<li>More and more&nbsp;<strong>sexual misconduct&nbsp;allegations are popping up for members of our government</strong>. Unlike most issues, this one hasn’t been partisan. Both Democrats and Republicans are being called out and we believe there’s probably more to come. The most recent to be caught up in the whirlwind of allegations is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/is-the-dam-of-congressional-sexual-harassment-allegations-breaking/546479/" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Representative John Conyers (D – Michigan)</a>. We have a feeling this is still just the tip of the iceberg.</li>
 	<li>There was a major&nbsp;<strong>terror attack in the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt)</strong>&nbsp;this week, in which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-raises-stakes-egypt-mosque-attack-n823986" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 300 people were killed</a>. The attackers carried ISIS flags as they attacked a Mosque during a religious service. This is one of the larger attacks Egypt has seen over the past years, and rare due to the target being a Mosque.</li>
 	<li>Upon returning from the Thanksgiving holiday,&nbsp;<strong>C</strong><strong>ongress will continue to focus on tax reform</strong>&nbsp;as the GOP, and President Trump, want to get a “win” before the Christmas holiday. This is one area you should focus on as the days of December pass.</li>
