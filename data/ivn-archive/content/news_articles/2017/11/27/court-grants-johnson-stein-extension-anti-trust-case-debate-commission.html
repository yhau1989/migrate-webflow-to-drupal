<p>Gary Johnson and Jill Stein still plan to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear <em>Johnson v. Commission on Presidential Debates</em>, their case using federal anti-trust law to attack the exclusionary policy of the Commission on Presidential Debates. Their cert petition was originally due at the end of November, but the Court has granted an extension to file. The cert petition is now due December 27.</p>
