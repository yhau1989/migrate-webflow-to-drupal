<p>Earlier this month Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-marijuana-hypertension-idUSKBN1AP0JS" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> the results of a study at Georgia State University, in which researchers found that smoking marijuana can result in higher blood pressure.</p>

<p>The alarmist headline emphasized the study's purported link between smoking marijuana and dying from high blood pressure related causes:</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The Reuters report never tells readers what the risk is in the first place to put it in perspective." author=""]
<h2>"Marijuana use holds three-fold blood pressure death risk: study</h2>
<p><em>LONDON (Reuters) - People who smoke marijuana have a three times greater risk of dying from hypertension, or high blood pressure, than those who have never used the drug...</em>"</p>

<p>Alarmist to be sure.</p>

<p>The Reuters report never tells readers what the risk is in the first place to put it in perspective.</p>

<p>The American Heart Association <a href="http://news.heart.org/high-blood-pressure-causing-deaths-despite-drop-heart-disease-stroke-deaths/" rel="noopener noreferrer">says that</a> 65,311 people died in the U.S. in 2011 from high blood pressure related causes.</p>

<p>That year, the US population was 311.7 million. So a randomly selected person living in America that year had a 0.0002% chance of dying a hypertension related death.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The report is essentially saying that there is a really very trivial and negligible increase in your risk for blood pressure related mortality if you smoke marijuana." author=""]

<p>So all the report is really saying, is that a study found that if you smoke marijuana, your chances of dying from high blood pressure related causes goes up from 0.0002% to 0.0007%.</p>

<p>And your individual starting risk of high blood pressure without smoking marijuana might be even lower than the 0.0002% for any randomly selected person in the population.</p>

<p>Depending on your blood pressure, overall health, age, sex, diet, levels of exercise, stress levels, and other relevant factors, your starting risk may be much lower.</p>

<p>The report is essentially saying that there is a really very trivial and negligible increase in your risk for blood pressure related mortality if you smoke marijuana.</p>

<p>Smoking marijuana makes <em>basically no difference at all</em> in your risk of hypertension related death according to this study.</p>

<p>That doesn't sound nearly as exciting, nor alarming as: <em>"Marijuana use holds three-fold blood pressure death risk: study</em></p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="This is a common tactic used by unscrupulous or careless journalists to create alarm and generate attention for their story. Or sway public opinion about a policy issue." author=""]

<p>But that's sensationalist journalism, and it is unacceptably irresponsible journalism when that sensationalism is attached to public policy prescriptions like this, from the study's author:</p>

<p><em>"If marijuana use is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and deaths, then it rests on the health community and policy makers to protect the public."</em></p>

<p>This is a common tactic used by unscrupulous or careless journalists to create alarm and generate attention for their story. Or sway public opinion about a policy issue.</p>

<p>If you were not aware of this before, you'll notice it everywhere now.</p>

<p>This article you are reading is not really about marijuana policy.</p>

<p>It's about journalism.</p>
