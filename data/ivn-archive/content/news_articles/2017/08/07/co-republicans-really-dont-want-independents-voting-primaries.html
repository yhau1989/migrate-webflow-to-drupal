<p>The Colorado Republican Party is considering nominating its candidates through caucus rather than an open primary that would allow unaffiliated voters (independents) to participate.</p>

<p>Voters approved two ballot initiatives in November that a) require Colorado to use primaries in presidential elections and b) open all statewide primary elections to independent voters.</p>

<p>Proposition 108 -- the initiative that opens the state's primary elections -- included a provision that allows parties to op-out of a primary election if they want. However, 75 percent of of the party's central committee must approve of using a caucus instead of a primary.</p>

<p>The Denver Post <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/08/05/colorado-gop-considers-canceling-2018-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported over the weekend</a> that the party's chair,&nbsp;Jeff Hays, will bring the question to a vote, but opposes the move. He believes the vote is the "right thing to do," since there were some members of the central committee who oppose open primaries.</p>

<p>One of those committee members is&nbsp;Ben Nicholas, who said the open primary will be&nbsp;"destructive to the party." Nicholas is reportedly in the minority, but is still not alone in the party-first mentality.</p>

<p>Proposition 108&nbsp;allows independent voters to choose between a Republican and Democratic ballot in the primary elections. It was approved by 63 percent of voters in November and was endorsed by Governor John Hickenlooper.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party, at the moment, has no intention of taking up the question of primary or caucus for a vote, saying it would send a wrong message to voters.</p>
