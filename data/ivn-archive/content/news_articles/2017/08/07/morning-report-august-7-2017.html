<h3>Venezuela Violence Following Election</h3>
<p>Fallout from the election in Venezuela is turning violent. A military base near the capital, Caracas, was attacked by armed men. The government claims to have quelled the attack, but not before some of the assailants made off with weapons.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk5nLvR4fIo" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video was released early Sunday </a>morning calling for Venezuelans to rebel against President Nicolas Maduro after his party established an all-powerful assembly meant to secure its grip over the country.</p>

<p>A man wearing military garb said in the video, “We declare ourselves in legitimate rebellion, united more than ever with the valiant state of&nbsp;Venezuela, to disavow the murderous tyranny of Nicolas Maduro."</p>

<p>After the attack, Maduro's government released a video stating, “We were the target of a terrorist, paramilitary, mercenary attack against peace. But they found us as a single fist, like an oak tree, united for peace.”</p>

<p>Maduro came to power after a contentious election July 30. In the vote, Venezuelans were&nbsp;asked to choose&nbsp;delegates from a list of party allies who would rewrite the Constitution and rule the nation while they did so. Voters were not given the option of rejecting the plan.</p>
<h3>UN Gets Support for North Korea</h3>
<p>On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution bringing new sanctions to North Korea for its continued ballistic missile testing. Resolution 2371 was passed unanimously.</p>

<p>The costly sanctions target North Korea's exports, including coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood.</p>

<p>Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said the sanctions will slash North Korea's annual export revenue of $3 billion by more than a third.</p>

<p>In a statement Haley noted, "this resolution represents the strongest sanctions ever imposed in response to a ballistic missile test."</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Russia and China did not vote against the Sanctions.</p>

<p>North Korea's state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun carried an article Sunday warning that the United States' only option will be self-destruction unless it gives up its "hostile policy" against Pyongyang.</p>

<p>Sunday evening President Trump spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae In. The South Korean President requested the call.</p>

<p>According to a White House readout of the call, the leaders "affirmed that North Korea poses a grave and growing direct threat to the United States, South Korea, and Japan, as well as to most countries around the world."</p>

Instead of just having your left wing representative screaming at your right wing representative, there’d be someone in the center to offer a perspective that would resonate with the common sense approach of most Americans."</em></p>
