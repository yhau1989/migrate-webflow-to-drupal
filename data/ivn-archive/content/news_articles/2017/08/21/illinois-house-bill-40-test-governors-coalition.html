<p>With Illinois remaining in political and budgetary gridlock, the governor may soon face challenges from within his own party.</p>

<p>Governor Bruce Rauner, a Republican elected in 2014, may sign Illinois House Bill 40. If passed, it would provide state funding for abortions <a href="https://abortion.ws/2017/08/13/handmaids-protesters-silently-urge-rauner-to-sign-abortion-rights-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">through</a> Medicaid and state health insurance programs. The bill also contains a provision to prevent the decriminalization of abortion in Illinois if Roe v. Wade is overturned.</p>

<p>The governor this spring indicated he would veto the bill. However, Rauner was <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2017/08/rauner-confirms-his-support-for-abortion-at-state-fair.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">noncommittal</a> at last week’s Illinois State Fair about whether he will sign the bill. Rauner <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/rauner-on-vetting-of-new-hires-were-not-perfect/" rel="noopener noreferrer">routinely</a> <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2017/08/rauner-confirms-his-support-for-abortion-at-state-fair.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">declares</a>&nbsp;that he supports "women’s reproductive rights."</p>

<p>Rauner similarly angered Republican activists a year ago on another law regarding abortion. He signed a bill requiring medical professionals opposed to abortion to provide information and referrals for patients still seeking one. Consequently, a judge <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-abortion-speech-scotus-0814-md-20170811-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked</a> enforcement of the law.</p>

<p>Recent <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/first-lady-diana-rauners-emails-focus-on-madigan-messaging-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention</a> has focused on his wife’s position and influence within the administration. A Freedom of Information Act request revealed Diana Rauner’s involvement in speeches and political strategy.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="A Freedom of Information Act request revealed Diana Rauner’s involvement in speeches and political strategy." author=""]

<p>Both Governor and First Lady Rauner contributed generously to groups such as Planned Parenthood, <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/article/20140928/News/140929167" rel="noopener noreferrer">before</a> and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/05/bruce-rauner-abortion-illinois-238057" rel="noopener noreferrer">after</a> he assumed office in 2015. The Rauners’ continuous support for groups associated with abortion rights has long <a href="https://realgopillinois.com/2017/08/16/rauner-quadruple-wifes-state-grants-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer">concerned</a> pro-life <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2015/08/will-bruce-rauners-support-for-planned-parenthood-remain-unequivocal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">segments</a> of the party.</p>

<p>Terri Koyne, a former Republican Party county chairperson, said a Rauner signature to House Bill 40 might be enough for his party support to collapse. She <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2017/08/rauner-confirms-his-support-for-abortion-at-state-fair.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"If he signs or allows this bill to become law and you are a social conservative, this should be enough to say that you can no longer support him. . . . If you are a fiscal conservative, this should be enough to say that you can no longer support him."</blockquote>
<p>Rauner won in a <a href="https://ivn.us/2014/03/10/republicans-eye-vulnerable-governor-illinois/" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowded</a> primary field in 2014. He could become vulnerable should enough anti-Rauner sentiment coalesce around a single primary challenger. William J. Kelly, a television producer, is the only other declared <a href="http://www.journal-republican.com/news/politics-and-government/2017-03-30/rauner-comments-prompt-kelly-run-governor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">candidate</a> in next year’s GOP gubernatorial primary.</p>

<p>Much of Rauner’s tenure has been marked by a budget impasse between the Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature. A legislative <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-rauner-wins-illinois-tax-increase-zorn-perspec-0709-md-20170707-column.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">override</a> of Rauner’s veto last month formally ended the stand-off. Yet battles over school <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/moodys-warns-delay-of-state-funding-for-illinois-schools-a-credit-negative/" rel="noopener noreferrer">funding</a> may still instigate a downgrading of Illinois’ credit rating.</p>

<p>Combined with these other challenges, Rauner's decision on Illinois House Bill 40 may prove pivotal to his political future in 2018.</p>
