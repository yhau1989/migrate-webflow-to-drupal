[heading title="Charlottesville Violence Subject to Federal Probe" subtitle=""]

<p>After the violence in Charlottesville over the weekend, the Department of Justice has opened a civil-rights investigation into a deadly car-ramming incident that witnesses said targeted counter-protesters at a white nationalist and alt-right rally in Virginia.</p>

<p>AG Jeff Sessions said:</p>
<p><em>"The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.”</em></p>
<p>As has been widely reported, a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 others injured with a car plowed into&nbsp;"anti-racist protesters" near the intersection of 4th and Water streets downtown.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence accused the MSM of being more concerned with attacking President Donald Trump's response to the violence than on condemning the violence itself. President Trump's reaction to the violence was viewed as not being strong enough.</p>

[heading title="Massacre at African Cafe" subtitle=""]

<p>Developing from overnight, at least seventeen people have been killed and nine others wounded after a number of assailants attacked a cafe in Burkina Faso last night.</p>

<p>It's still not known how many attackers are involved.</p>

<p>A government spokesman said the victims were from a number of countries. Efforts are underway to identify the bodies so the authorities can inform their families.</p>

<p>According to CNN, a perimeter is set up and all roads leading up to the Ouagadougou International Airport are closed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40920338" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a report from the BBC</a>, there are fears that the attack is the work of one of the affiliates of al-Qaeda that is&nbsp;active in the region.&nbsp;Burkina Faso is part of the Sahel region, which includes Mali where Islamist groups have been active since 2012.</p>

[heading title="Lawmakers Face Debt Ceiling When They Return" subtitle=""]

<p>Health care reform and updating the tax code will have to be put on hold when Congress returns to session.</p>

<p>Congress will have 12 working days to approve legislation to raise the nation's debt ceiling — or risk an economic disaster.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department says the debt ceiling, a statutory limit of outstanding debt obligations that the federal government can hold,&nbsp;must be raised by September 29.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-countdown-trump-congress-raise-2017-8" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a report from the Business Insider</a>, if breached, it could lead to disastrous&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;for the federal government, the US economy, and the global financial system.</p>

<p>The possible fallout from the nation&nbsp;defaulting on its loans, according to a study by the Treasury Department, would include&nbsp;a meltdown in the stock and bond markets, a&nbsp;downgrade of the US's credit rating, which would increase the government's borrowing costs, and the undermining of the full faith and credit of the country.</p>
