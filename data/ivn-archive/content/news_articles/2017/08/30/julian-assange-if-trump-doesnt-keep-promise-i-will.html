<p><a href="/tag/julian-assange" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Julian Assange</strong></a> issued a warning to the FBI Wednesday: If you conceal information on the Hillary Clinton investigation, <a href="/tag/wikileaks" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WikiLeaks</strong></a>&nbsp;won't.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="FBI just refused someone's FOIA request for Clinton probe files claiming a lack of public interest. Thanks FBI. You keep WikiLeaks strong." author="Julian Assange"]

<p>Citing a "lack of public interest," the FBI has shut down a request to turn over files related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. The issue became a major problem for the Democratic candidate as she pursued the White House in 2016.</p>

<p>Ty Clevenger, an attorney in New York, filed the request in 2016. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/29/fbi-lack-public-interest-emails-justifies-withhold/" rel="noopener noreferrer">His reaction to the news</a>, “Frankly, I am stunned I should have to explain why my request pertains to a matter of public interest."</p>

<p>Hours after the FBI announced it would not release the files, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange sent the following tweet:</p>

<p>It's not clear why the FBI chose to conceal its findings, or when&nbsp;WikiLeaks will release what it has. The timing is interesting though as Clinton is set to go on her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/promotionalss/article/74662-hillary-clinton-to-do-speaking-tour-to-promote-new-book.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">book tour starting September 18.&nbsp;</a></p>
