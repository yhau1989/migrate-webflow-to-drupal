<p>US constitutional law scholar Noah Feldman says there are three common propositions that people have when they look at the state of politics in the US:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Partisanship has never been&nbsp;this bad;</li>
 	<li>It is "geographically spatialized" like never before; and</li>
 	<li>There is no tool or mechanism to remedy it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feldman notes in a TED Talk that despite popular belief, all three of these propositions are wrong. He even explains that&nbsp;partisanship has a birthplace in America:&nbsp;a dispute between Alexander Hamilton and James Madison that would change the face of US politics forever.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the irony of this is that Hamilton helped Madison work on a constitutional system&nbsp;that Madison believed was "against political parties and made&nbsp;them unnecessary." Madison and Hamilton wrote the Federalist Papers together, which was the "marketing plan" for their vision of this constitutional system.</p>

<p>So what happened?</p>

<p>Well, the birth moment of hyper-partisanship happened over a dispute the two men had on&nbsp;Hamilton's vision for the US economy; specifically, the national bank, the "immortal" US debt, and a policy that put priority on&nbsp;trade and manufacturing over agriculture. Things escalated so quickly that two close friends soon became bitter political enemies, and the result was the birth of the country's first political parties.</p>

<p>Feldman goes deeper into this, as well as the constitutional remedy that exists to temper factionalism. It's worth watching.</p>
