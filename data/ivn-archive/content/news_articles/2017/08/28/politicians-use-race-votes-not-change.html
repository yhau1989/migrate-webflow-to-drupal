<p>Are politicians truly sincere about fixing an underlining problem when they raise the issue of race? According to a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2017/72_say_politicians_talk_race_to_get_votes" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Rasmussen poll</a>,&nbsp;most voters say no.</p>

<p>"A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 72% of Likely U.S. Voters believe most politicians raise racial issues to get elected, while 13% think these issues are raised by politicians who want to address real problems," Rasmussen reports.</p>

<p>We've heard a lot from politicians and media pundits on the subject of race and racial issues in the US. It's an emotional topic&nbsp;that gets voters fired up.</p>

<p>Yet the one thing that has been missing from much of the discussion are solutions -- a point raised by former Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson two weeks ago.</p>

<p>"Let’s...turn our outrage into a productive and overdue look at what we can do to place our laws, our rhetoric and our politics squarely on the side of equality under the law," writes Johnson.</p>

<p>And it is not just&nbsp;one party or group that is the culprit, either. Both sides do it.</p>

<p>The two-sided narrative in the mainstream media has kept the focus on race relations and racial tensions in the US without actually getting&nbsp;into systemic and institutional problems that the two-party duopoly&nbsp;has failed to address.</p>

<p>So it is understandable that voters think politicians only talk about race to get votes -- to get voters so angry at the other side that they turn out to vote for them or their party.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
