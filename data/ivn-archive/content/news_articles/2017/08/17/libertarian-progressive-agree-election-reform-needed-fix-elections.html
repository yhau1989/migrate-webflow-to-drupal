<p>It kind of sounds like an odd pairing at first, no? A self-described "neo-libertarian" and a "progressive Democrat"&nbsp;join forces. Yet what they are advocating for is something most people will agree on: We need fairer elections.</p>

<p>Manu Koenig -- the "neo-libertarian" -- and Faisal Fazilat -- the "progressive Democrat" -- are two locals of Santa Cruz, California, who want their city to adopt <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a>. It is reform that they&nbsp;say has been endorsed by&nbsp;former President Barack Obama, Sen. John McCain, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, among others.</p>

<p>“It’s an issue that both sides of the political spectrum can agree on—because, in the end, every side wants fair elections. Everyone wants it to be democratic,” says Fazilat. (<em>Good Times</em>, <a href="http://goodtimes.sc/santa-cruz-news/ranked-choice-voting-supporters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 16, 2017</a>)</p>

<p>How does ranked choice voting work? Here is a video that explains it and why advocates support it:</p>

<p>Here are a few things supporters say ranked choice voting can do:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Eliminate&nbsp;"strategic voting" or "lesser-of-two-evils" voting by allowing voters to rank multiple candidates by preference.</li>
 	<li>Eliminate the "spoiler effect," where voting for a candidate outside the two largest political parties runs the risk of skewing the results to the favor of&nbsp;a major party candidate the voter doesn't want in office.</li>
 	<li>Ensure the winner of elections has majority support. The choose-one voting method used in most jurisdictions in the US doesn't guarantee the winner will get over 50% of the vote if there are more than two candidates in the general election.&nbsp;Under RCV, instant runoff elections are conducted, eliminating the poorest performing candidates until a winner gets over 50 percent of the vote.</li>
 	<li>Create a more civil campaign environment, with less mudslinging, since candidates are no longer just fighting for a voter's single vote, but to be their second or even third choice -- so they will actually talk issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Ranked choice voting would encourage candidates to actually talk about the issues that voters care about. This kind of system favors grassroots campaigns where candidates are going door-to-door. They’re talking with as many people as they can,” says&nbsp;Faisal Fazilat.</p>

<p>Ranked choice voting <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used" rel="noopener noreferrer">is currently used in 11 cities</a>, will be used in Memphis <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/ranked_choice_voting_is_coming_to_memphis" rel="noopener noreferrer">starting in 2019</a>, and is the law of the land in <a href="/tag/rcv-maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine</a> for statewide and non-presidential federal elections. Voters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/07/18/santa-fe-voters-need-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved ranked choice voting in 2008</a>, but the city council has yet to implement&nbsp;its use in city elections.</p>
