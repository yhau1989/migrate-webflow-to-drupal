<h2><strong>Time for Missouri to Truly Go Purple</strong></h2>
<p>In a story on IVN.us, Erik Fogg says it's high time for Missouri to send an independent to Congress.</p>

<p>Fogg writres:</p>
<p><em>"Missouri is a classic American Purple state. It is coveted by presidential candidates much as Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Florida: It voted twice for Clinton, but also voted for Bush, McCain, Romney, and Trump — all by narrow margins. </em></p>
<p><em>"Missouri has&nbsp;gone ten years without two senators of the same party, and 133 years since it sent representatives from only one party to DC. Most importantly,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/party-affiliation/by/political-ideology/among/state/missouri/" rel="noopener noreferrer">over a third of Missourians</a>&nbsp;consider themselves moderates. Fifteen percent of Missourians&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/party-affiliation/by/political-ideology/among/state/missouri/" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t even lean toward one party or another</a>."</em></p>
<p>After leaving the Democratic Party in 2015, Missouri State Representative Keith English <a href="https://ivn.us/2015/02/24/keith-english-two-party-dominance/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lamented</a>, “If you don’t belong to the two-party system, you won’t get elected.”</p>

<p>Why is there such a gap? Why do independent and moderate Missourians have no representatives at all?</p>

<p>It’s because the game is rigged.</p>

<h2><strong>Gary Johnson Wants Solutions, Not Finger Pointing</strong></h2>
<p>It's been a week of harsh rhetoric following the violence in Charlottesville last weekend.</p>

<p>Former Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson says it's time to end the hate speech and look to solutions to solve the chasms in our political differences.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/2017/08/16/gary-johnson-charlottesville-lets-find-solutions-not-point-fingers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an op-ed syndicated on IVN. us</a>, Johnson writes:</p>
<p><em>"In the aftermath of the weekend events in Charlottesville, we have seen the media and too many politicians get sidetracked into debates over whether we are sufficiently outraged. </em></p>
<p><em>"Personally, I’m not sure there actually&nbsp;are&nbsp;words to adequately capture the lowliness of a bunch of white supremacists who carry baseball bats and homemade shields into a so-called 'rally.' </em></p>
<p><em>"Yes, words are important. But actions are more important. Likewise, if we are to get into the finger-pointing business, I’m not sure any of us has enough fingers. At whom, exactly, do we point?"</em></p>
<p>Johnson argues a good place to start is reforming the criminal justice system and have politicians stop demonizing immigrants.</p>

<p>He closes with, "Let’s at least turn our outrage into a productive and overdue look at what we&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>do to place our laws, our rhetoric and our politics squarely on the side of equality under the law and&nbsp;<em>against&nbsp;</em>any form of discrimination."</p>

<h2><strong>For First Time, US Rep. Meets with Julian Assange</strong></h2>
<p>For the first time, a U.S. congressman sat in a room with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to discuss the allegations that Russia meddled in our 2016 election.</p>

<p>The remarkable details have been published in a number of online websites. <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/346904-assange-meets-us-congressman-vows-to-prove-russia-did-not-leak-him" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill reported the following</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Julian Assange told a U.S. congressman&nbsp;on Tuesday&nbsp;he can prove the leaked Democratic Party documents he published during last year’s election did not come from Russia and promised additional helpful information about the leaks in the near future. </em></p>
<p><em>"Rep. Dana Rohrabacher became the first American congressman to meet with Assange during a three-hour private gathering at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has been holed up for years."</em></p>
<p>Assange has always maintained Russia did not hack the DNC and the e-mails provided to his group did not come from a Russia-affiliated organization.</p>

<p>Rohrabacher says he has shared the information with President Donald Trump. He is the first member of Congress to visit Assange in Ecuador. The meeting was also attended by a WikiLeaks attorney.</p>
