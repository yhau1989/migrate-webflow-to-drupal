<p>In what was meant to be a news conference about the president's infrastructure plan, quickly devolved into a shouting match between the media and the president over the weekend violence at Charlottesville.</p>

<p>When pressed about his initial statement on Saturday, President Trump said, "I gave a statement on the facts I had. And I stand by what I said."</p>

<p>The president then noted that he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trumps-full-statement-on-the-violence-in-charlottesville/2017/08/14/722446aa-810e-11e7-9e7a-20fa8d7a0db6_video.html?utm_term=.7912541581d3" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated his statement on Monday</a> after learning more facts about what had transpired. In his second statement, he specifically called out the KKK and white supremacists for their role in the violence.</p>

<p>In his Tuesday's news conference, the president blamed both sides, the "alt-left" as well as the "alt-right," for their roles in the riot.</p>

<p>Aside from the Charlottesville reactions, the biggest headline at the news conference appears to be Steve Bannon, the president's chief political strategist, could be on his way out.</p>

<p>When asked about Bannon, the president said, "Mr. Bannon came on (my campaign) very late. I like him, he's a good man."</p>

<p>President Trump said similar things about White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci shortly before&nbsp;his release.</p>

[heading title="Third World Infrastructure Plan" subtitle=""]

<p>President Trump likened our country's infrastructure to a third world country, and announced it was time to eliminate the onerous regulations that stall projects for "20 years."</p>

<p>President Trump held up a sheet that nearly extended to the floor showing the regulation hurdles developers must meet before proceeding on a project.</p>

<p>The president noted, "Right now the process is way too cumbersome. It takes 20 years for a highway to be built. We are going to remove the regulations and give developers a chance to complete the regulatory process in less than two years."</p>

<p>He thought the plan would get bipartisan support, unlike the health care reforms that were sunk by Congress.</p>
