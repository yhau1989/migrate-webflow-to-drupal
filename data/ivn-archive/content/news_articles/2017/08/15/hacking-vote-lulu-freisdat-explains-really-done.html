<p>This week on <em>A Civil Assessment</em> we meet the award-winning election journalist Lulu Friesdat.</p>



<p>T.J. and Lulu discuss her history reporting on elections, her documentary “Holler Back” about voters who did not vote in 2004, the annual tech conference DEF CON where hackers broke into election machines in under 2 hours, bipartisan election security, the Wisconsin, Georgia, and Florida recounts, and more.</p>

<p>Lulu walks us through how hackers easily hacked a number of different election machines, much&nbsp;of which was made easier due to simple passwords (such as “ABCDEF”) and lack of encryption. She recommends voting via paper, in order to secure your vote!</p>
