<p>There is an A-list celebrity that has joined a growing movement to end political corruption in the United States: <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://represent.us" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Represent.us</strong></a>, the nation's largest grassroots anti-corruption campaign, announced recently that they are teaming up with the Hollywood star&nbsp;to raise money for the organization and its efforts. It was&nbsp;announced in <a href="http://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-vogue-september-issue-2017-cover" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article in Vogue Magazine</a>&nbsp;that Lawrence&nbsp;was joining the board of Represent.us as well.</p>

<p>“If you’re a Republican, if you’re liberal, it doesn’t matter,” she said. Lawrence says the goal is “getting money and corruption out of politics,” and “freeing our democracy.”</p>

<p>“We are thrilled to work with Jennifer Lawrence on fighting corruption around the country and passing laws that put the American people first,” said Josh Silver, director of Represent.us.</p>

<p>The campaign is offering a <a href="https://www.omaze.com/experiences/jennifer-lawrence-wine-picnic?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Represent.us&amp;utm_campaign=experiences.jennifer-lawrence-wine-picnic&amp;utm_term=1&amp;oa_h=9ijuc9" rel="noopener noreferrer">chance for donors to win a trip to go wine tasting with Lawrence</a> at "a top California vineyard."</p>

<p>Represent.us is currently involved in a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/18/communities-banding-together-end-political-corruption-fix-elections-massachusetts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of anti-corruption efforts</a>, including a <a href="https://ivn.us/tag/represent-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new state constitutional amendment</a> in South Dakota to restore a voter-approved initiative&nbsp;that was&nbsp;scrapped&nbsp;by state lawmakers in February.</p>

<p>The organization is also raising awareness and support for the <a href="https://act.represent.us/sign/issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Anti-Corruption Act</a>, which aims to "stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix the electoral system."</p>
