<p>Voter registration on Colorado <a href="https://coloradopolitics.com/a-surge-in-unaffiliated-voters-helps-set-a-new-record-for-colorado/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly hit a record high</a>&nbsp;recently, and it is independent voters who are driving the surge.</p>

<p>Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams reported Monday that over 25,000 new or returning voters have registered since June 28. The boost in voter registration was mostly provided by unaffiliated voters, who made up nearly 14,000 new or returning voters.</p>

<p>According to the Colorado secretary of state, total voter registration is at 3.7 million. Registered unaffiliated voters currently make up the largest voting bloc in the state -- outnumbering the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Unaffiliated voters can now participate in crucial statewide and presidential primaries after Propositions 107 and 108 were approved by voters in 2016. Independents can choose between a Republican and Democratic primary ballot.</p>

<p>The record number of registered independent voters now have a greater say in who ends up representing them in statewide and federal elections.</p>
