<p>T.J. O’Hara is joined by author and attorney Jeff Rasley.</p>



<p>Jeff performed a small Facebook experiment concerning civility. The two discuss this experiment, the post-election conversations that take place on social media, “silos of the like-minded,” and more.</p>
<blockquote><span>“If you just depend on the hearsay of social media, you’re not going to get an objectively accurate picture of what’s happening.”</span></blockquote>
<p>Jeff Rasley is the author of ten books and numerous articles. His most recent book is “POLARIZED! The Case for Civility in the Time of Trump: An experiment in civil discourse on Facebook.” He graduated from University of Chicago, and received his JD at Indiana University Law School.</p>
