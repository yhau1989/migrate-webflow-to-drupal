searchTitle: 5 Key Ways to Bridge the Hyper-Partisan Divide on Infrastructure
-->
<p>Remember all that talk about infrastructure during the 2016 presidential campaign?</p>

<p>America needs massive new investments in infrastructure: safer bridges; modern sewers; a more efficient electricity grid; better transportation options; an upgraded air traffic control system; and so on.</p>

<p>Building infrastructure would create jobs in the short run. More important, it would make us richer and more productive as a nation in the long run.</p>

<p>When the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago polled an ideological panel of economists on the benefits of infrastructure investment, <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/infrastructure-revisited" rel="noopener noreferrer">98 percent of them agreed</a> that “the federal government has an opportunity to increase average incomes by spending more on roads, railways, bridges and airports.” (The other 2 percent were uncertain.)</p>

<p>Infrastructure investment should be a natural area for bipartisan cooperation. So where are we on that?</p>

<p>Sadly, the toxic partisanship in Washington has derailed (pun intended) what should be a logical place for the two parties to work together.</p>

<p>As with so many other issues, a handful of Centrist Independents could be the catalyst for infrastructure investments that would pay economic dividends for decades, if not longer.</p>

<p>The whole point of building a Centrist Caucus in Washington is to jump start legislative action by offering a vision that combines a common sense desire to govern with the best of what the Republicans and Democrats bring to the table.</p>

<p>Here is what a Centrist Caucus roadmap for infrastructure investment might look like:</p>
<h3><strong>1. This can’t be the usual list of pork barrel projects.</strong></h3>
<p>Americans are rightfully skeptical that Congress will put infrastructure dollars to good use, as opposed to passing them out as political goodies.</p>

<p>Remember all those economists who thought infrastructure investment was a good idea — in theory. More than half of them also worried that “many of the projects would have low or negative returns.”</p>

<p>Congress needs to develop clear, objective, and measurable criteria for evaluating projects: improving safety; reducing traffic congestion; promoting economic development; reducing carbon emissions; and so on.</p>

<p>Every project can then be scored against those criteria — by an independent body, if necessary — with the best projects getting funded. That is how most private companies develop their capital budgets.</p>
<h3><strong>2. The Republicans are right: We should put private capital to use through public-private partnerships.</strong></h3>
<p>Government ought to plan for our infrastructure needs; in many cases, the private sector can fund, build, and operate those assets.</p>

<p>Most infrastructure projects spin off revenue: tolls, landing fees, and like. Governments at every level are strapped for cash. The private sector can put up capital for worthwhile projects; in exchange, they get a steady, predictable stream of revenues.</p>

<p>We need better public infrastructure. Nothing about that says government needs to build or operate it.</p>
<h3><strong>3. The Democrats are right: Many infrastructure investments should support our environmental goals. </strong></h3>
<p>When we get serious about climate change — and we are going to have to get serious — we will have to get more Americans out of their cars.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="We need better public infrastructure. Nothing about that says government needs to build or operate it." author="Charles Wheelan"]

<p>The U.S. is a global laggard in terms of public transit. Those who drive are often stuck idling in horrific traffic. Meanwhile, a smarter electricity grid is one of the most efficient ways to conserve energy.</p>

<p>America has an enormous capacity to move people and goods in ways that are faster and less polluting than we do now.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Whenever possible, consumers ought to pay for the infrastructure they are using, whether it is an airport or a sewer or a bridge. </strong></h3>
<p>Making users pay is a way to recoup our investments (which makes the private investment in #2 possible).</p>

<p>Tolls and other kinds of variable pricing are also a powerful tool for preventing congestion. Why is traffic so bad in most metropolitan areas? Because we take a valuable resource (space on the road at 8:30 a.m. on a weekday) and give it away free.</p>

<p>No one likes tolls. But having drivers (and other infrastructure users) pay for what they use is a pretty common sense idea.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Infrastructure spending can be a powerful tool for dealing with the next economic downturn.</strong></h3>
<p>We need to create a list of pre-approved federal infrastructure projects — like a capital budget — that can be funded more aggressively when we hit an economic rough patch.</p>

<p>When the economy slows, we should be building more. Not only does this put Americans back to work, it is also the cheapest time to be doing construction.</p>

<p>When the financial crisis hit in 2008, infrastructure spending would have been a good way to put Americans back to work. Unfortunately, there was a shortage of “shovel-ready projects.”</p>

<p>That should never happen again. We should approve worthwhile projects as soon as possible (See #1) so they will be shovel-ready when the economy needs a dose of fiscal stimulus.</p>

<hr>

<p>During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton all proposed that we spend more federal money to improve our nation’s infrastructure. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/190136/americans-say-yes-spending-infrastructure.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventy-five percent of Americans agree</a> that would be a good thing to do.</p>

<p>So far, we have done nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>This is a sensible idea with broad support — in other words, exactly the kind of policy a Centrist Caucus would get behind. Let’s start building from the center.</p>
