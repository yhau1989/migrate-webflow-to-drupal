<p>It probably comes as&nbsp;no surprise to many that Congress' approval among US adults is 16 percent, according to Gallup.</p>

<p>One would expect the approval rating among Democrats to be down, as Republicans control both chambers of Congress. Independents also have a low approval of Congress -- at around 16 percent.</p>

<p>But what is driving down Congress' approval rating more than anything is a huge drop among Republicans.</p>

<p>The latest congressional approval numbers published Wednesday, August 9, shows that approval among Republicans in particular dropped from 28 percent in July to 16 percent in August.</p>

<p>The GOP faithful seem to be losing faith in their party's ability to&nbsp;get one of its biggest campaign promises done -- repealing the Affordable Care Act. The Senate failed on multiple attempts and proposals to repeal and replace the health care legislation.</p>

<p>The national conversation as it pertains to Congress has largely been on Russia investigations and health care. As a result, every other issue that is important to the American people has fallen by the wayside.</p>

<p>"When members return from recess, they might find their attempts at less contentious measures, such as boosting infrastructure funding, more appealing to Americans -- which could ultimately improve their approval rating," Gallup suggests.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think? Are you surprised by Congress' approval rating? What issues do you think they should be focused on?</strong></p>
