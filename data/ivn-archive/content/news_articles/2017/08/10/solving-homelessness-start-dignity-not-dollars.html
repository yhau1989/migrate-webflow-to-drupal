<p><em>"Every life deserves a certain amount of dignity, no matter how poor or damaged the shell that carries it." - Rick Bragg</em></p>

<p>The challenge in solving the homelessness problem in this country is that it takes heart, consistency, and courage. And in our fast-paced, gotta-have-it-yesterday world, far too few politicians possess all three qualities.</p>

<p>Homelessness isn't a political issue; it's a human issue. Yet every time the subject is raised, we search for answers in our politics, which inevitably leads us to our comfortable corners.</p>

<p>Democrats blame Republicans for inaction. Republicans blame Democrats for spending money on programs that result in reliance on the government, rather than responsibility. The result: the focus is lost, nothing gets accomplished.</p>

<p>Enter Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter his political affiliation; what matters is that he had an idea and acted to make his city a better, more enriching place.</p>

<p>Mayors across the United States should be asking themselves one question: Are your solutions to panhandling working?</p>

<p>Chances are if that solution is punitive and your city is handing out tickets to panhandlers, the answer is probably no.</p>

<p>Berry recognized that the most valuable "thing" a person has is their labor, and he applied it to his streets.</p>

<p>Berry created the program, "There's A Better Way." Everyday, using a city-owned van, and partnering with a local non-profit, the program coordinator drives around the city, picking up homeless hires for the day.</p>

<p>The panhandlers make $9/hour, are fed, and then connected with counseling services to manage their mental health and re-enter society.</p>

<p>The result:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>400 city blocks in the city of Albuquerque have been cleaned up</li>
 	<li>117,000 pounds of trash have been removed</li>
 	<li>More than 1,700 homeless have taken part in program</li>
 	<li>216 have received long term employment opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>But Berry wanted more. So he coupled his "There's A Better Way" effort with "Albuquerque Heading Home," a housing first model where the city houses the chronically homeless.</p>

<p><em>To date, 650 of Albuquerque's most at-risk homeless have a place to live and are piecing their lives back together.</em></p>

<p>Albuquerque’s city leaders noticed that two critical things happen when you empower people with your trust: 1) their dignity rises, and 2) they become valuable members of society.</p>

<p>Homeless experts across New Mexico have noted that earning $9/hr (above New Mexico minimum wage) teaches them the value of teamwork, brings them out of their mental isolation, and re-engages their spirit.</p>

<p>Some say the value of those attributes for a community cannot be measured.</p>

<p>But that's not true, they can be measured. Just look at what the two programs have meant to the homeless population in Albuquerque:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>80% reduction in unsheltered homelessness</li>
 	<li>40% reduction in chronic homelessness</li>
 	<li>A virtual end to Veterans homelessness</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this mean every city can achieve these results? No. But word is spreading.</p>

<p>Chicago, Denver, Dallas, and Seattle have all contacted Albuquerque and are working toward similar programs in their respective cities.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Government can be an answer. Government can be the problem. And sometimes, the solution doesn’t fit so neatly into a purely ideological perspective." author=""]

<p>Perhaps solutions to the homelessness crisis requires a recognition of the value of dignity over dollars.</p>

<p>Sounds simple, but for some reason it's been lost on so many city leaders trying to find a cure for an ever-growing problem.</p>

<p>Government can be an answer. Government can be the problem. And sometimes, the solution doesn’t fit so neatly into a purely ideological perspective.</p>
