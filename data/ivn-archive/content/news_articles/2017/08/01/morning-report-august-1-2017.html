<h3><strong>Election Hacking Concerns Need Solutions, Not Partisan Bickering</strong></h3>
<p>There is arguably nothing more important to our democracy, than keeping elections safe and free from hackers.</p>

<p>In a piece on IVN, Editor Shawn Griffiths notes:</p>
<p><em>"We've known for some time that state voting machines are incredibly vulnerable to cyberattack.&nbsp;Is this breaking news? No.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)" rel="noopener noreferrer">White hat hackers</a>&nbsp;(ethical hackers) in recent history have demonstrated time and time again just how easy it is to hack into the machines."</em></p>
<p>So, the question remains, what is being done about it?</p>
<p><em>"At the nation’s largest cybersecurity conference over the weekend,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defcon.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEF CON</a>, attendees were invited to hack a number of voting machines used across the country. What many found was that these&nbsp;machines are actually very easy to hack into."</em></p>
<p>The article later adds, "Knowing what we know about how vulnerable voting machines are,&nbsp;why are we not talking about preventive measures? Why aren’t lawmakers demanding greater security&nbsp;from the companies that make these machines?"</p>

<p>Might be time to put the partisan blame game away and take the proper steps to ensure uncompromised elections.</p>

<h3><strong>Executive Action on Health Care?</strong></h3>
<p>With the GOP's utter failure to upgrade and fix Obamacare, President Trump has indicated he might take steps to begin the process himself. Indeed, US Senator Rand Paul confirmed this Monday afternoon.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The president has said he is considering executive action after the Senate failed to pass a measure to reform the (health care) system." author=""]

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-paul-trump-idUSKBN1AG2JR" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a story posted on Reuters</a>, Paul said he spoke with President Trump and thought the president had the authority to create associations that would allow organizations to offer group health insurance plans.</p>

<p>The president has said he is considering executive action after the Senate failed to pass a measure to reform the system.</p>

<p>While Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he would like to move on from the "skinny" repeal failure, other senators like Lindsey Graham have stated their intentions to try and keep fighting for a deal.</p>
<h3><strong>GOP House Members Calls For Mueller</strong></h3>
<p>In a story from&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/344711-gop-house-member-calls-on-mueller-to-resign" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheHill.com</a>, House Judiciary Committee member Rep.&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/people/trent-franks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trent Franks</a>&nbsp;of Arizona wants the resignation of Robert Mueller.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Bob Mueller is in clear violation of federal code and must resign to maintain the integrity of the investigation into alleged Russian ties." author="US Rep. Trent Franks"]

<p>Mueller is leading the Department of Justice’s Russia investigation.</p>

<p>Franks claims Mueller has a huge “conflict of interest," saying Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey are “longtime allies.”</p>

<p>In a statement Franks wrote, "Bob Mueller is in clear violation of federal code and must resign to maintain the integrity of the investigation into alleged Russian ties."</p>

<p>House members are also calling for a second special counsel investigation on Russia. The second would reportedly focus on Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, and Barack Obama.</p>
<h3><strong>Opinion: Don't Trust the DNC Just Yet</strong></h3>
<p>In an opinion piece on IVN, Jesse Shayne says let's <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/07/31/dont-trust-new-dnc-just-yet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">not rush out and trust the DNC just yet.</a></p>

<p>Shayne writes:</p>
<p><em>"How can you expect a group of people who have proven themselves to be corrupt and out-of-touch to change overnight? The DNC’s organizing apparatus — the consulting firms, lobbyists, and staffers who rake in millions of dollars from DNC campaigns and operations — has too much on the line to concede any real control."</em></p>
<p>Democrats are touting their new slogan, "A Better Deal." We'll see if it resonates with voters in the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
