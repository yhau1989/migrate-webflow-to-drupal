<p>The 2020 presidential election has its first announced candidate, and he supports nonpartisan primary reform in all states: US Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.).</p>

<p>Delaney officially announced he is running for the Democratic nomination in three years, explaining in an interview that he sees "no downside in getting in early" and spending the time to build his name ID.</p>

<p>Delaney is best known in the election reform community for his support of nonpartisan open primaries and independent redistricting commissions.</p>
