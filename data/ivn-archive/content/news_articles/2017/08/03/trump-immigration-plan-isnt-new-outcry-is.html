<p>In looking around the world at immigration policies, you'll find <strong>Merit/Point-Based Immigration</strong> systems in a number of countries.</p>
<div>

According to <a href="http://www.fairus.org/issue/merit-based-immigration-systems" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR</a>, the following countries are:

</div>
<div>
<ul>
 	<li>Australia</li>
 	<li>Austria</li>
 	<li>Canada</li>
 	<li>Denmark</li>
 	<li>Germany</li>
 	<li>Hong Kong</li>
 	<li>Japan</li>
 	<li>Mexico*</li>
 	<li>New Zealand</li>
 	<li>South Korea</li>
 	<li>United Kingdom</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><em>*Mexico doesn't officially classify its immigration policy as a merit/point-based system, but has many of the same tenets as the system.</em></p>

<p>Running point-based immigration systems smoothly though is what many immigration experts say is the fly in the ointment.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Trump advocates a repackaged immigration plan&nbsp;that was introduced in&nbsp;the Senate 10 years ago." author=""]

<p>They&nbsp;say that for an immigration compromise to endure, Congress might have to pass off control over the system to an executive branch agency capable of quick, flexible responses.</p>

<p>At&nbsp;a news conference Tuesday, President Trump, along with Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, unveiled a repackaged version of an immigration plan that was introduced to the Senate 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Among the highlights of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/president-donald-j-trump-backs-raise-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAISE Act</a>:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Replaces the current permanent employment-visa framework with a skills-based system that rewards applicants based on their individual merits.</li>
 	<li>Rewards education, English-language ability, high-paying job offers, past achievements, and entrepreneurial initiative.</li>
 	<li>Eliminates the outdated Diversity Visa lottery system, which serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>As expected, Democrats and the mainstream media were in solidarity in their criticism of the plan. What was a bit unexpected was the dissension from the Republican Party, including Lindsey Graham, who <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-trump-s-immigration-proposal-would-be-devastating/article_a28a1a52-77b0-11e7-aba1-bbb38f874191.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the plan</a> would, "devastate South Carolina."</p>
<h3><strong>Washington Hypocrisy</strong></h3>
<p>In a NY Times&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/world/americas/05iht-05immig.6000279.html?pagewanted=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview nearly 10 years ago to the day,</a>&nbsp;Graham said of virtually the same immigration point system:</p>
<p><em> "America needs an immigration system that can compete for the best minds that exist in the world. The new system (point system) does it better than the old system." - US Sen. Lindsey Graham</em></p>
<p>The same article notes that the merit system was not only proffered by then President George W. Bush, but was also given the green light by then Senator Barack Obama.</p>

<p>In the heat of his first presidential campaign, Obama offered an amendment to end the point-based system after a five-year trial run, but voted <a href="http://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-figures/barack-obama5.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/1639" rel="noopener noreferrer">S. 1639</a>, which would have created a merit-based immigration system in the United States.</p>

<p>The bill failed to pass.</p>
<h3><strong>60 Votes Needed</strong></h3>
<p>As for Trump's plan, it's the support from Republicans that will eventually determine the future of the bill, which needs 60 votes to pass the Senate.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="America needs an immigration system that can compete for the best minds that exist in the world." author="US Sen. Lindsey Graham"]

<p>But as we saw with health care reform, that will be an steep climb. Just look at reaction from two Republicans from Texas:</p>

<p>Rep. Lamar Smith from San Antonio:</p>
<p><em>“Our current system fails to prioritize immigration based on skills and abilities. Existing immigration policies do not prioritize the interests of American workers and taxpayers.&nbsp;The RAISE Act ensures that our legal immigration system admits those with the highest training and abilities to spur economic growth and innovation.”</em></p>
<p>Rep. Will Hurd from San Antonio:</p>
<p><em>"If you can't have a bipartisan piece of legislation on immigration, it's not going to go anywhere in the Senate."</em></p>

<h3><strong>Point/Merit-Based Immigration History</strong></h3>
<p>Point based immigration is inspired by the immigration policies of Canada, Australia and of all countries Mexico.</p>

<p>One of the tenets of <a href="https://factreal.wordpress.com/2010/05/08/mexico-vs-united-states-mexican-immigration-laws-are-tougher/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mexico's immigration law</a> that's common with Trump's policy states:</p>

<p>"Mexico welcomes only foreigners who will be useful to Mexican society."</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="If you can't have a bipartisan piece of legislation on immigration, it's not going to go anywhere in the Senate." author="US Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas)"]

<p>The commonality of the countries lies in the system where applicants with better work skills have a better chance of being admitted.</p>

<p>In 1967, a points system was introduced in Canada to rank potential immigrants for eligibility. Race, color, or nationality were <strong>not</strong> factors in the new system; rather, work skills, education levels, language ability (in speaking French or English), and family connections became the main considerations in deciding who could immigrate.</p>

<p>This is the crux of the Trump plan.</p>

<p>If a similar version of Trump's plan passes Congress, it would revolutionize the American system, but in today's political climate and 24-hour news cycle, scoring partisan political points appears more important than enacting a point-based immigration system.</p>
