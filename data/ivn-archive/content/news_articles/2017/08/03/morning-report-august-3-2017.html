<h3><strong>What will Rosenstein do?</strong></h3>
<p>The clock is ticking for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Republicans of the House Judiciary committee sent a letter noting they want a second special counsel investigation into the practices of Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Loretta Lynch, and more.</p>

<p>So far, no word from Rosenstein.</p>

<p>The committee wants to investigate 14 separate categories of conduct by officials in the Obama administration, including unlawful spying, “unmasking” and leaking of information for political purposes during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath.</p>

<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072717_HJC-Letter-to-AG-DAG.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">The letter,</a> dated July 27 states,</p>
<p><em>“Our call for a special counsel is not made lightly. We have no interest in engendering more bad feelings and less confidence in the process or governmental institutions by the American people. Rather, our call is made on their behalf. It is meant to determine whether the criminal prosecution of any individual is warranted based on the solemn obligation to follow the facts wherever they lead and applying the law to those facts."</em></p>
<p>Additionally, the&nbsp;announcement last&nbsp;<span>Thursday</span>&nbsp;by House Intel Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes that there were “hundreds” of suspicious unmasking requests by Obama officials; and other publicly available evidence brought more urgency to the investigation.</p>

<p>If Rosenstein punts, it could mean his job.</p>
<h3><strong>Sessions is Safe... Will Address Leaks Friday</strong></h3>
<p>A new report from the Associated Press says two unnamed sources confirmed that new White House chief of staff John Kelly placed a phone call to Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the weekend and told him the President is content with the job he is doing.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="President Trump called Sessions 'beleaguered' and 'very weak' and chastised the decision not to investigate Hillary Clinton." author=""]

<p>Kelly, who was appointed to the post the day before, described the president as still upset at Sessions but did not plan to fire him or hope he would resign.</p>

<p>Last week on Twitter, President Trump called Sessions “beleaguered” and “very weak” and chastised the decision not to investigate Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump said he was “disappointed” in Sessions and suggested that, had he known he would recuse himself on the Russia investigation, he never would had offered him the attorney general post.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/0d5486490cf94f7cb99517ed1abbf07e" rel="noopener noreferrer">AP article noted</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Sessions and Kelly have also been allies and traveled together to the Mexican border in April to highlight immigration plans when the chief of staff was in his former post as head of homeland security."</em></p>
<p>Also of note, Sessions will hold a news conference&nbsp;Friday to address investigations into criminal leaks and his plans to crack down on them.</p>
<h3><strong>Terminating Gerrymandering</strong></h3>
<p>As reported on IVN.us, the former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger is on a mission to terminate gerrymandering.</p>

<p>As noted by IVN Editor Shawn Griffiths:</p>
<p><em>"Partisan gerrymandering has become the biggest focus of&nbsp;Schwarzenegger’s post-gubernatorial political career. He is working with lawyers to help in the case&nbsp;Whitford&nbsp;v. Gill, which is scheduled to be heard before the Supreme Court on October 3, attending events to raise awareness, and started the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crowdpac.com/communities/arnold" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terminate Gerrymandering Crowdpac</a>."</em></p>
<p>The story appeared in <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/25/the-governator-wants-to-terminate-gerrymandering-215416" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> which includes a podcast with the former governor. <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/25/the-governator-wants-to-terminate-gerrymandering-215416" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link here.</a></p>

<p>When asked if he would make a return to politics,&nbsp;Schwarzenegger said he’s done running. As for the Senate rumors that flare up every few months, he’s not interested.</p>

<p>“Why would I run for Senate?” He&nbsp;said. “To be one of 100 here? That’s not my style.”</p>
