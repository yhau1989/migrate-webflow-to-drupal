<h3><strong>Democracy In America</strong></h3>
<p>Many view voting as a right, but others view it as a privilege. The United States is a nation abundant with laws that unquestionably deny many citizens certain rights, and felon disenfranchisement is a prime example of that.</p>

<p>Nationwide, millions of felony convicted Americans are denied the right to vote and there is strong correlation among those most affected and the voter turnout in elections.</p>

<p>In Florida, a <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/Opinion/op-ed/article140235388.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">petition is currently circulating</a> with the hopes of restoring the voting rights of&nbsp;felons convicted of nonviolent criminal offenses.</p>
<h3><strong>Decline In Voter Turnout</strong></h3>
<p>Ex-felons who are disenfranchised are disproportionately African-American males, which asserts the likeliness that disenfranchisement causes declines in black voter turnout rates. This ban on voting rights of a certain group of people explicitly violates the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>With this petition, Florida intends to join Maine and Vermont in putting a stop to denying ex-felons the right to vote:</p>
<blockquote>“[I]n Florida, roughly 25 percent of the state's black male residents can't vote because of a current or past conviction,” the petition states.</blockquote>
<p>If Florida takes on this opportunity to enfranchise those who lost their right to vote, it could possibly make a difference in the voter turnout of future elections.</p>
<h3><strong>Do The Crime, Pay The Time</strong></h3>
<p>Proponents of keeping nonviolent ex-felons stripped of their voting rights argue that felons have reaped the consequence of being disenfranchised, and assert that&nbsp;it doesn't impede on the democratic principles on which this country was built.</p>

<p>This sentiment gives them the opportunity of failing to consider implications the issue&nbsp;has on the overall democratic process, especially voting. They’ve committed the crime and as a consequence, they’ve done the time. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<h3><strong>No Votes? No Representation</strong></h3>
<p>Lack of voter turnout in certain communities is an outcome of felon disenfranchisement. As a result, legislators often ignore or fail to address the needs of underprivileged populations that are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Furthermore, disenfranchisement allows iniquity to thrive in the justice system as politicians lack responsiveness and the ability to serve the very same communities in which they&nbsp;hold office.</p>

<p>If this petition gets enough signatures, Florida can restore democracy back in their state, but more specifically, to those communities that are unrepresented politically.</p>
