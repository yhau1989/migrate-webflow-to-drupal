<p>It has now been over 400 days since the late Justice Antonin Scalia passed away and a potential replacement is finally getting a hearing before the Senate. On Monday, March 20, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch at 11 a.m. EDT.</p>

<p>Gorsuch testify Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Monday will consist of opening statements from committee members and Gorsuch, and outside witnesses are scheduled to testify before the committee on Thursday.</p>

<p>President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> announced Gorsuch as his pick to fill Scalia's seat on <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/01/31/meet-donald-trumps-pick-replace-justice-scalia/" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 31</a>.&nbsp;The president said it fulfilled his campaign promise to nominate an originalist to the Supreme Court -- to replace Scalia with someone who shares his legal philosophy.</p>

<p>Gorsuch, who was previously appointed by George W. Bush to serve on the Tenth&nbsp;Circuit Court of Appeals, believes in a more literal interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and was ranked by a study from Mercer University as the second-closest to Scalia of the 21 prospective picks.</p>

<p>Going into Monday's hearing, Gorsuch may find that his confirmation to the Supreme Court will not be as easy as his confirmation to the Tenth Circuit, which was approved by a voice vote on the Senate floor. Republicans and Democrats are expected to make it quite the partisan show:</p>

<p>Some online feel Gorsuch's nomination was not legitimate because former President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, was never given a hearing. Republicans stalled Garland's confirmation proceedings, pointing to the fact that it was an election year.</p>

<p>Others, <a href="/2017/01/06/partisanship-destroying-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer">including former Vice President Joe Biden</a>, have urged Democrats not to follow down the same road of obstructionism.</p>

<p>Online, Gorsuch's nomination and hearing have received mixed responses from both users and media outlets:</p>

<p>The hearings will give the American people greater insight into who Neil Gorsuch is and what type of Supreme Court justice he could be.</p>
