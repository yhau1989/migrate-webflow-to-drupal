<p>The FEC released a press release Wednesday that it&nbsp;will not appeal a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/01/breaking-federal-judge-rules-presidential-debate-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal judge's decision</a> against current rules governing the Commission on Presidential Debates in <em>Level the Playing Field v. FEC</em>:</p>

<p>"On February 1, the District Court ordered the Commission to reconsider Plaintiffs’ allegations and evidence, issue a new decision on the two administrative complaints and issue a new decision on the rulemaking petition. The Commission voted on February 22 not to appeal the District Court’s decision."</p>

<p>The FEC has chosen to comply with&nbsp;Judge Tanya S. Chutkan's order&nbsp;and&nbsp;must issue three new decisions related to the administrative complaints that were previously dismissed by the FEC&nbsp;by April 3.</p>

<p><span>"Plaintiffs will have the tough task of making sure the FEC&nbsp;</span><span>and the&nbsp;</span><span>CPD&nbsp;</span><span>don't&nbsp;</span><span>try and skirt their</span><span>&nbsp;obligations going forward</span><span>," said Chad Peace, attorney for the Independent Voter Project, who&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/ivp_files_amicus_brief" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed an amicus brief</a> in support of the Plaintiffs.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
