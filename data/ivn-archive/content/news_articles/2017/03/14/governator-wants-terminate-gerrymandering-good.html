<p>Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was, perhaps, one of the most unusual governors in any state’s history -- but not just because he was a celebrity weightlifter and movie star. He was also extremely nonpartisan.</p>

<p>Whether he was “successful" as the "Governator" of California is up for debate. But what isn’t up for debate is his steadfast&nbsp;support for reforms that try to reduce the level of hyper-partisanship that pervades politics these days.</p>

<p>Before leaving office as governor, Arnold supported two important nonpartisan initiatives in particular: (1) independent redistricting, and (2) nonpartisan primaries. With his support, they both passed.</p>

<p>Now, although rumors had circulated that he would run for US Senate, Arnold announced Sunday that he’s only interested in one thing: terminating partisanship.</p>
