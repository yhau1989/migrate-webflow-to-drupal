<p>T.J. O'Hara, IVN correspondent and host of <a href="/tag/a-civil-assessment" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A</em>&nbsp;<em>Civil Assessment</em></a> (IVN's newest podcast), appeared on <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/on-air/as-seen-on/POLY-SPEAKING-WEB-03_24_17_seg3_San-Diego-417037633.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Politically Speaking</em></a> Sunday evening, a weekly segment on NBC7 in San Diego. Hosted by Gene Cubbison, O'Hara was brought on to talk about the state of civility (or lack thereof)&nbsp;in American politics.</p>

<p>"We clearly have the greatest partisan divide we have had at least in my lifetime," O'Hara says.</p>

<p>Some key takeaways from the segment.</p>
<blockquote>"The only thing I would tell people to do is, why don't we approach it from a different perspective, rather than the hyper-partisan perspective? Let's approach it with cautious optimism... Let the people play out whether [a politician] is competent or not." - T.J. O'Hara

"The question is, do we allow our perceptions to dictate our reality? Or, are we willing to step back and say, 'Let's wait until we see the results, and then we can measure both people'?" - T.J. O'Hara</blockquote>
