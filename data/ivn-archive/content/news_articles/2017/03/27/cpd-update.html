<p>Outside the fall presidential debates, there are&nbsp;a lot of people who don't know about the Commission on Presidential Debates, mostly because it keeps its internal matters quiet. For instance, few noticed that the CPD swapped co-chairs in January, with Michael D. McCurry being replaced by Dorothy S. Ridings. Even McCurry's Wikipedia page still says he&nbsp;co-chairs the debate commission.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/09/16/debate-commission-co-chairs-politically-invested-major-party-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously reported on IVN</a>, McCurry is most known as President Bill Clinton's press secretary, though he did serve on the Democratic National Committee before that.&nbsp;Ridings, who was already a member&nbsp;of the debate commission, is a former president of the League of Women Voters (from 1982-1986), right before the League walked away from presidential debates.</p>

<p>Before the Commission on Presidential Debates took over the&nbsp;debates, the League of Women Voters was the primary sponsor of them, dating back to 1976. However, the parties wanted a greater say in how the debates were conducted, and thus&nbsp;in 1985 signed an agreement to become primary sponsors.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/27/us/2-parties-to-run-political-debates.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">1985 article</a> in the&nbsp;New York Times, the League criticized the parties' efforts to take over the debates, including Ridings, who questioned&nbsp;how third party and independent candidates would fare under Republican and Democratic sponsorship.</p>

<p>Thus, in 1987&nbsp;the Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, created by party chairs Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr, (Republican, still a co-chair) and Paul G. Kirk, Jr (Democrat).</p>

<p>The League remained on as a co-sponsor of the fall debates until the next presidential election in 1988. In October 1988, the League withdrew its sponsorship because the organization believed "the&nbsp;demands of the two campaign organizations would <a href="http://lwv.org/press-releases/league-refuses-help-perpetrate-fraud" rel="noopener noreferrer">perpetrate a fraud on the American voter</a>."</p>

<p>Though the debate commission is registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, its&nbsp;operations have largely been controlled by people loyal to the Republican and&nbsp;Democratic Parties&nbsp;-- a bipartisan effort. Ethical questions have even surfaced over the extent of this loyalty. McCurry, for instance, <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/09/16/debate-commission-co-chairs-politically-invested-major-party-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave money to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign</a> while a co-chair of the CPD. Fahrenkopf also has a long history of campaign and party donations.</p>

<p>What the co-chair swap means for the future of the debate commission is currently unknown. The CPD already reportedly lost <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/12/21/debate-commission-loses-one-third-board-members/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a third of its members</a>&nbsp;while it was the subject of two lawsuits filed against it and&nbsp;the FEC. A federal judge <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/01/breaking-federal-judge-rules-presidential-debate-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled in favor of Peter Ackerman and Level the Playing Field</a>, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed against the FEC, who are&nbsp;challenging the CPD's rules that determine which candidates make it on the debate stage.</p>

<p>The other case, an anti-trust lawsuit filed by Gov. Gary Johnson, Dr. Jill Stein, their respective parties, and affiliated groups, will get <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/03/17/presidential-debate-commission-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer">another day in court</a> on April 21 before the D.C. Court of Appeals. This may be the beginning of dramatic change to how the Commission on Presidential Debates functions and operates.</p>
