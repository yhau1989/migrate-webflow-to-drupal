<p>Today’s parliamentary elections in the Netherlands are attracting an unusual amount of global interest, and one man is responsible: Geert Wilders.</p>

<p>In 2016, the world over saw an explosion in anti-globalist sentiments. From the <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/23/globalization-faces-political-backlash-turns-nationalism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">success of Brexit in the U.K. to the election of Donald Trump</a> in the U.S, to the emergence of populist candidates in France, Germany, and other countries, it looked like nationalism&nbsp;was&nbsp;gaining strong support around the world.</p>

<p>How successful Wilders' party, the Freedom Party, is at gaining&nbsp;seats in parliament will be one of three major tests in Europe in 2017 that will determine the fate of populism and globalism not only in Europe, but in global policy.</p>

<p><span>Dubbed the “Dutch Trump” by the press, Wilders and Trump do share a few similarities. Physical resemblances aside (many comment that Wilders’ bleached hair is similar to Trump’s), Wilders appears to share Trump’s communication tactics, including using Twitter as a means to attack political opponents and to promote&nbsp;himself.</span></p>

<p>However, Wilders has garnered a lot of attention for rhetoric that is more extreme than&nbsp;anything Trump has said.</p>

<p>Wilders <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/03/14/dutch-election-geert-wilders-mark-rutte/99153844/" rel="noopener noreferrer">refers to Islam</a> as a "totalitarian ideology," and wants to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/08/dutch-voters-head-to-the-polls-on-march-15-here-are-4-things-to-know/?utm_term=.484c655105bf" rel="noopener noreferrer">ban mosques</a>, which he has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/08/dutch-voters-head-to-the-polls-on-march-15-here-are-4-things-to-know/?utm_term=.484c655105bf" rel="noopener noreferrer">compared to</a> “Nazi Temples.” And with nearly 20 years of parliamentary experience, along with being the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11443211" rel="noopener noreferrer">founder</a> of his Freedom Party, Wilders can't tap into an outsider's potential appeal like Trump.</p>

<p>What can we expect to come from this election? We will have to wait to know for sure. The Netherland’s election process is lengthy and complex, as the Dutch voters <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/08/dutch-voters-head-to-the-polls-on-march-15-here-are-4-things-to-know/?utm_term=.484c655105bf" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t vote directly</a> for prime minister. However, the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/03/14/dutch-election-geert-wilders-mark-rutte/99153844/" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest polls</a> show that the incumbent party has recently gained a slight edge over Wilders’ party after months of trailing behind.</p>

<p>Time will tell, but it will be interesting to watch and see if the populist trend is strong enough to tip elections from the Netherlands, to France and Germany alike, and what a rise of nationalist leaders could mean for the future of the European Union.</p>
