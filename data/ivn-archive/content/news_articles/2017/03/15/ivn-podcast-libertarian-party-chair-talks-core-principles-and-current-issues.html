<p>This week meet the party whose mantra is “good ideas don’t have to be mandatory.”</p>



<p>Host T.J. O’Hara is joined by the Libertarian National Committee Chair Nicholas Sarwark. The two discuss the Libertarian Party’s core principles; where the party stands in relation to Trump’s economic policies, healthcare, the Dakota Access Pipeline, the U.S. military, and immigrant vetting; and what’s next for the Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>Nicholas Sarwark is a second generation Libertarian with a commitment to fighting for fair ballot access for the libertarian candidates around the country. Sarwark was a criminal defense attorney, served as a deputy public defender in Colorado, has more than a decade in computer consulting and sales experience, and recently moved to Arizona to join the family business, the oldest independent auto dealership in Phoenix.</p>
