<p>This week meet the party that believes power starts from the bottom up.</p>



<p>Host T.J. O’Hara is joined by Green Party National Political Organizer Adrián Boutureira. The two discuss the Green Party’s core philosophies, and what’s next for the party.</p>

<p>Adrián came to the US in 1973 following the consolidation of the brutal right wing military regime in his native country of Uruguay. He has since spent most of his adult life in the US engaged in the struggle for social justice. To this end, he has co-founded and served in several key national and community-based organizations as program director, political organizer, outreach coordinator, popular educator, policy analyst, and community outreach coordinator. In December 2014, Adrián joined the Jill Stein 2016 campaign, where he served as Field Director and Special Advisor on Palestinian and Latin American Affairs.</p>
