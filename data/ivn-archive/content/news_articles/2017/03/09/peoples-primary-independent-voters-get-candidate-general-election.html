<p>A bill was recently introduced in Oregon that would reform primary elections in a whole new way.<span>&nbsp;Republican state Representative Knute Buehler, of District 54, is the sponsor of bill </span><a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB3140" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>HB-3140</span></a><span>, also known as&nbsp;the Peopleâ€™s Primary.</span></p>

<p>The People's Primary opens the first stage of the public election process in a way no other state does. Put simply, HB-3140 reforms the current closed primary system by adding a ballot for independent voters. Voters registered with a party can vote in their party's primary. However, if these voters wish to opt out of participating in their party's primary or are unaffiliated, they can&nbsp;participate in the People's Primary.</p>

<p>Here is how it works:</p>

<p>The system would opt for voters, parties, or a coalition of parties to nominate candidates who they want to be in the primary. Candidates then submit their nomination to the secretary of state to ensure qualification.</p>

<p><span>Once nominated and confirmed, voters registered with a political party can vote in their party's primary per usual. Voters not affiliated with a party are mailed the People's Primary election ballot, and voters affiliated with a party may request the People's Primary ballot instead of their&nbsp;party's ballot.</span></p>

<p>Candidates affiliated with a political party who qualify for the primary appear on their party's ballot. All candidates, including candidates not affiliated with a party, appear on the People's Primary ballot and their party affiliation -- or lack thereof -- is indicated on the ballot.</p>

<p>The winner of each party's primary AND the People's Primary would be&nbsp;guaranteed a spot on the general election ballot.</p>

<p><span>The bill was introduced on March 1.&nbsp;While it would be a new primary system to be implemented, if passed, the concept behind it is not new.</span></p>

<p>In April 2016, IVN published <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/04/07/introducing-the-public-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article</a> by <a href="http://fairvote.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">FairVote</a> detailing the Public Primary, which initially was proposed by a member of the <a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> (a co-publisher of IVN). Both the People's Primary and the Public Primary are very similar in nature, with the biggest difference being the&nbsp;use of ranked choice voting in the Public Primary.</p>

<p><span>Undoubtedly, HB-3140&nbsp;would drastically change the current closed primary system in Oregon. According to <a href="http://openprimaries.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPrimaries.org</a>, roughly 30 percent of </span><a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/states_oregon" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Oregon</span></a><span> voters are registered as non-affiliated or independent. </span></p>

<p>In an election climate where nearly all elections are decided in the primary stage, a significant bloc of voters in Oregon do not currently have an equal say in who ends up representing them. T<span>here clearly is a desire for change among these voters. It is up to Oregon lawmakers to decide if establishing the People's Primary will be the change&nbsp;the state needs.</span></p>
