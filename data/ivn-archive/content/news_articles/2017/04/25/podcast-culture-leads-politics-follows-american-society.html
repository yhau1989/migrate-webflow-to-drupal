<p>This week host T.J. O’Hara is joined by Scott Rasmussen.</p>



<p>T.J. discusses Scott’s February article, "<a href="https://www.creators.com/read/scott-rasmussen/02/17/do-we-have-a-legitimate-government" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do We Have a Legitimate Government?</a>"&nbsp;and what that could mean. They delve into the regulatory state, how culture leads and politics follows, and the decentralization of American society. Scott’s new book, <a href="http://www.politicshasfailed.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Politics Has Failed, America Will Not</em></a>, explores these ideas and more.</p>
