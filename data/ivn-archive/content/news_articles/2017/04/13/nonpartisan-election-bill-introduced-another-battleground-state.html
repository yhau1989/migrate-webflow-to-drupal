<p>North Carolina may be jumping on the “Top-Two” train. A house bill&nbsp;introduced this week, H.B. 737, would reform&nbsp;the current partisan open primary system to a nonpartisan, top-two primary similar to the systems already in place in California and Washington state.</p>

<p>H.B. 737 was introduced by state Reps. Ken Goodman (D-Rockingham) and Pricey Harrison (D-Greensboro). It would put all state and congressional elections on a single primary ballot where all voters and candidates, regardless of party affiliation, participate.</p>

<p>In the current system, any eligible voter may vote in any party’s primary election, but each party has a separate partisan primary election.</p>

<p>The new bill still allows for write-in candidates in the general election. However, if a candidate is on the ballot in the primary, they cannot be a write-in candidate in November.</p>

<p>In regards to vacancies, parties or committees are currently given the jurisdiction to choose a replacement without a vote. H.B. 737 would require the governor to hold an election to fill the seat or office.</p>
