<p>During the Thursday episode of the Ron Paul Liberty Report, Dr. Ron Paul interviewed WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange.</p>

<p>Paul and Assange discuss CIA Director Mike Pompeo's remarks about WikiLeaks, calling it a "non-state hostile intelligence service," and said the U.S. should no longer allow WikiLeaks "the latitude to use free speech values against us.‚Äù</p>

<p>Assange argues that&nbsp;the CIA is manipulating terminology and even creating new categories&nbsp;for publications that report on national security and intelligence so that it can act against it extrajudicially. Watch the full interview above.</p>

<p>What do you think? Are the CIA's remarks and actions a threat to free speech? Can WikiLeaks be reasonably labeled a "non-state hostile intelligence service"? Is this all a dangerous slippery slope that could lead to broader censorship?</p>
