<p><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong> – In three counties just north of Atlanta, voters are heading to the polls for a special election Tuesday.</p>

<p>The nationally watched election is getting enormous attention as Democrats are looking for a salve to heal their wounds from the November election. Although no Democrat has taken the 6th&nbsp;Congressional District since 1979 when Newt Gingrich took office for 10 consecutive terms, there is a sense of optimism from the left, as President Donald Trump’s 48% from this district in November represented a significant drop in relative support for the Republican nominee. Indeed, since 2000 no Republican nominee received less than 59.2 percent of the vote in the district.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/04/15/524076532/outside-money-and-volunteers-pouring-into-georgia-special-election" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cash is also pouring into the election</a> from outside the state.</p>

<p>Busloads of volunteers from the Washington D.C. area, Michigan, and New York are helping Democrats. Volunteers want to fight back against President Trump and the Republican Congress. Democrat Jon Ossoff has raised more than $8 million, more than any House candidate in Georgia history. And most of it has come from out-of-state.</p>

<p>Republican groups have also responded, pumping at least $5 million into the race.</p>

<p>With all the attention going to Ossoff and his push to signal the Donald Trump retribution tour, no one is noticing the lack of choices for third-party candidates. The <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia%27s_6th_Congressional_District_special_election,_2017" rel="noopener noreferrer">party choices</a> in this special election are as follows:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>11 Republicans</li>
 	<li>5 Democrats</li>
 	<li>2 Independents</li>
</ul>
<p>For voters who might want to register a protest against President Trump’s rhetoric but don’t want to pledge an endorsement for the far-reaching agenda by the Democrats, what do they do?</p>

<p>The MSM doesn’t seem to care that the glaring omission is a mainstream Libertarian candidate for Congress -- a&nbsp;Libertarian candidate who says yes to economic growth, driving free trade, fair immigration policies, and a robust national dialogue on how to fix our broken health care system.</p>

<p>If we learned anything from the presidential election, it’s that the RNC and DNC, both privately run corporations, are intent on keeping third-party candidates and their constituents away from the national political discourse.</p>
