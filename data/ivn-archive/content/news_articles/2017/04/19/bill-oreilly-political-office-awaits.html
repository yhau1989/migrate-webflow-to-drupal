<p>Caution, you have entered the No Spin Zone.</p>

<p>Word that Fox News host <strong>Bill O’Reilly</strong> is out at the network has the liberal left grinning from ear to ear. It’s a win at a time it was badly needed. The political wounds that linger from the election in November and the Georgia special election debacle, gives the O’Reilly wrinkle political value for Democrats. And having a pelt, ANY pelt on the wall is important. Momentum for the left these days is harder to find then hen’s teeth.</p>

<p>Spinning this, as O’Reilly has done for decades in primetime, might just prove as easy as 1-2-3. The "No&nbsp;Spin Zone," as a campaign slogan, could rival his good friend President Donald Trump’s MAGA.</p>

<p>With a Master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University and a penchant for headline-grabbing teasers, O’Reilly could be in good position to run for political office.</p>

<p>Sure, O’Reilly could take the easy path and resurface at the History Channel with his popular book series or just pick a network du jour, but at his age, 67, and with his credentials, it’s quite possible&nbsp;he will choose a different path entirely.</p>

<p>For those wondering where O’Reilly leans on the political spectrum, it might surprise you. O’Reilly has noted, “To this day I'm an independent thinker, an independent voter, I'm a registered independent&nbsp;... [T]here are certain fundamental things that this country was founded upon that I respect and don't want changed. That separates me from the secularists who want a complete overhaul of how the country is run.”</p>

<p>And that’s a memo.</p>
