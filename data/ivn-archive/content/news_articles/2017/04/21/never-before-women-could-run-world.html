<p><em>Update: In France's presidential election, Marine Le Pen advances to runoff with Emmanuel Macron. Election to be held on May 7.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Female leaders are&nbsp;taking Europe by storm. As never seen before, the "western" powers -- Germany, the United Kingdom, and France&nbsp;-- could all be under female leadership.</p>

<p>The French presidential election's first round will take place Sunday, April 23, which&nbsp;includes&nbsp;Marine Le Pen, the president&nbsp;of France's&nbsp;nationalist movement, the National Front.</p>

<p>France's presidential election uses two-round voting. If a candidate wins an outright majority in the first round, they are elected, and if not, the two leading candidates&nbsp;compete in a run-off election on May 7.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38220690" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polling</a> suggests an outright win is unlikely, with front runners <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-french-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">including</a>&nbsp;Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, and François Fillion.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;Le Pen wins (in the first round, or second in May), it could&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first time in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-11-04/why-europe-asia-and-latin-america-elect-more-female-leaders" rel="noopener noreferrer">history</a> that several major European powers are led by women,&nbsp;<em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<p>Whether this is a victory for feminism, or just happenstance that these women&nbsp;represent the politics of the masses, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/world/europe/political-strategy-for-europes-far-right-female-leaders-wooing-female-voters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">trend</a> continues throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Let's take a brief look at female&nbsp;<span>heads of state</span> across Europe today:</p>
