<p>In 2014 and 2015, <a href="/tag/level-the-playing-field" rel="noopener noreferrer">Level the Playing Field</a> (LPF) filed two complaints against the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Simply put, LPF argued that (1) the CPD was&nbsp;not a nonpartisan organization, as its&nbsp;tax-deductible nonprofit status requires, and (2) the&nbsp;CPD's rule requiring candidates to get 15% in the polls in order to qualify for the presidential debates was&nbsp;unfair.</p>

<p>The FEC dismissed both&nbsp;complaints without any real consideration.</p>

<p>In January, LPF filed a complaint in federal court to challenge the FEC's administrative decision as being arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.</p>

<p>In February, a federal judge agreed with LPF, issuing a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/03/federal-judge-issues-blistering-ruling-fec/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blistering opinion</a> against the FEC.&nbsp;As part of that opinion, Judge Chutkan ordered the FEC to reconsider a&nbsp;mountain of evidence in support of LPF's argument&nbsp;against the partisan nature of the CPD and unfairness of the 15% rule.</p>

<p>In March, the FEC chose not to appeal the decision. Instead, they complied with the judge's order and re-issued an opinion that "considered" the evidence.</p>

<p>The decision below addresses&nbsp;many of the arguments and pages of evidence offered by Level the Playing Field's complaint. However, it offers little in the way of a rationale for why no candidate other than a Republican or Democrat has qualified for the debates in 25 years, especially considering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/09/01/paleologos-poll-johnson-stein-debates/89710228/" rel="noopener noreferrer">76% of Americans wanted to hear a third voice</a> in 2016&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Notably, the FEC is a commission composed of six appointed members -- three Republicans and three Democrats -- who have been unable to make important decisions on account of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/fec-deadlock-update-april-2015.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">their own hyper-partisan deadlock</a>. Decisions by the FEC require four members of the commission to agree with each other.</p>

<p>So, when asked to reconsider its&nbsp;opinion on whether the composition and rule-making of the CPD were&nbsp;unfair to everyone except Republicans and Democrats, the decision seemed to come easy.</p>

<p>The FEC's opinion rationalizes partisan activities, statements, and even donations made by CPD&nbsp;members and chairs. For example, the decision shrugs off&nbsp;public statements by CPD members that express clear opposition to the inclusion of independents and/or third parties in the debates by rationalizing that, "there is no indication that the statements from officers and directors were made in their official capacity as representatives of CPD."</p>

The FEC also points to an interesting argument made by the CPD that having more inclusive debates standards would, "creat[e] an unacceptable risk that leading candidates with the highest levels of public support would refuse to participate."

<p>In other words, "we can't control the parties because the parties control us."</p>

<p>The plaintiffs&nbsp;have 60&nbsp;days to respond to the decision.</p>
