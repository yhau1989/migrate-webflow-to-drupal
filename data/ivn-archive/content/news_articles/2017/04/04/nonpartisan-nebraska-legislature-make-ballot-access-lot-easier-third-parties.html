<p>Historically, Nebraska has long set itself apart from the rest of the country in the way its legislature is elected and functions. One state senator&nbsp;believes it should also be unique in the way it treats third parties and third party&nbsp;candidates in statewide elections.</p>

<p>Nebraska’s nonpartisan unicameral system is the only one of its kind in the United States. Nebraska elects state lawmakers using a nonpartisan, top-two system that does not include party affiliation on the ballot, and all legislators&nbsp;serve in one chamber.</p>

<p>“It encourages members to think about who would be the best candidate for the job and who might do the best job and not fall into a party line,” said Nebraska State Senator Laura Ebke.</p>

<p>Senator Ebke, a Libertarian, is the author of&nbsp;<a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=31144" rel="noopener noreferrer">LB34</a>, a bill that strengthens ballot access for third parties wanting to field candidates in statewide elections. Currently, in order for a party to maintain ballot access, a candidate nominated by that party must receive at least 5 percent of the vote in a statewide race. Otherwise, a candidate must petition for ballot access.</p>

<p>“People have lost their ballot status because the party only got 3-4% in a statewide race, so all people registered as Libertarian (for example) would have to re-register. To get status again the party would have to petition," Ebke explained.</p>

<p>She&nbsp;believes the current electoral system works against any non-major party. LB34 is meant to make the process fairer.</p>
<blockquote>“You still have to petition on, but if they (minor parties) have gone out and accumulated 10,000 registered voters then they no longer have to fulfill that 5%. They don’t have to worry about petitioning back on later, so they can work on building their parties from the ground up.” - Senator Laura Ebke</blockquote>
<p>LB34 is supported by members of&nbsp;major and minor parties alike. The bill has been uncontroversial amongst constituents as well.</p>

<p>“Competition is a good thing; if you have more parties then&nbsp;you have more debate and discussion and more difference of opinion. It sharpens everybody’s arguments and makes it clear where they stand,” said Ebke.</p>

<p>Ebke, chair of the judiciary committee, finds that being a Libertarian has allowed her to “exercise a certain level of independence.” Her congressional colleagues welcome her, and her role in the legislature depends little on her party association.</p>

<p>Currently, third party candidates in Nebraska are forced to exhaust all their resources in one place just to maintain ballot status in&nbsp;statewide races. Ebke believes that they should have the chance to build their party up instead.</p>

<p>The bill is projected to hit the governor's desk by&nbsp;the end of the&nbsp;week. Senator Ebke is confident that it will become law.</p>
