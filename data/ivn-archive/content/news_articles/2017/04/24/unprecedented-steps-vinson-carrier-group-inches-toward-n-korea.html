<p><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong>â€” According to multiple reports, the USS Vinson strike carrier group out of San Diego has almost reached the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p>Two Japanese destroyers will join the group as well as several South Korean ships. Over the next few days, the U.S. Air Force will also be conducting exercises in the region.</p>

<p>The USS Michigan, a nuclear-powered guided missile U.S. submarine, is also set to arrive in the region Tuesday. The Michigan is armed with around 150 Tomahawk missiles, with a range of about 1,000 miles. Those are the&nbsp;same type missiles that were used in the Syrian strike.</p>

<p>President Trump is securing political cover and support in Washington. In an unprecedented move, all 100 U.S. senators are going to be briefed on North Korea at the White House late afternoon Wednesday. On the same day, President Trump is discussing tax and healthcare reform, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will be briefing reporters on the escalation off the Korean coast.</p>

<p>This comes on the heels of North Korea announcing it has detained a third U.S. citizen over the weekend. And, adding even more concern to the conflict, Tuesday is Army Day in North Korea.</p>
