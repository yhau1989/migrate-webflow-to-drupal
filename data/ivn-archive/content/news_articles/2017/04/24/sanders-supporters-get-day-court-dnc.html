<p>The class action lawsuit <a href="http://jampac.us/dnclawsuit/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wilding, et. al. v. DNC Services, d/b/a Democratic National Committee and Deborah "Debbie" Wasserman Schultz</em></a> will be heard Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The lawsuit was originally filed on June 28, 2016.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed by a group of <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a> supporters, alleges that leaders in the Democratic Party propped up Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary over Sanders, violating the DNC's own rules on neutrality. The lawsuit was filed&nbsp;nearly a month before <a href="/tag/WikiLeaks" rel="noopener noreferrer">WikiLeaks</a> dumped over 20,000 DNC emails, some of which indeed showed explicit bias in favor of&nbsp;Clinton and efforts to marginalize Sanders' campaign.</p>
<h4><strong>All the court-filed documents can be found <a href="http://jampac.us/dnclawsuit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong></h4>
<p>These emails included plans&nbsp;to target Sanders' religious beliefs, pitching a story that&nbsp;his campaign was&nbsp;in disarray, media collusion, and prepping statements about the end of his campaign in April.&nbsp;Then DNC Chair <a href="/tag/debbie-wasserman-schultz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debbie Wasserman Schultz</a> even reportedly sent an email calling Sanders' campaign director an "ass" for declaring that his candidate would continue to fight on to the convention.</p>

<p>But that isn't all, and you can read more <strong><a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></strong>. Wasserman Schultz resigned her position&nbsp;in wake of the email scandal.</p>

<p>Now, Sanders supporters will have a chance to make&nbsp;their case against the DNC and Wasserman Schultz before a federal judge. District Court Judge&nbsp;William J. Zloch scheduled oral argument earlier this month on the defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendants will make the case that plaintiffs lack standing.</p>
