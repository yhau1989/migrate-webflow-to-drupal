<p>Several of Trump’s executive orders have now been blocked by federal district court judges.</p>

<p>First the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel ban</a>, then on Tuesday President Trump’s sanctuary city executive order was blocked by U.S. District Judge William Orrick. The judge&nbsp;issued a temporary <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ruling-idUSKBN17R2QO" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruling</a> in a lawsuit against the executive order targeting so-called sanctuary cities.</p>

<p>The decision will remain in place for now, but both cases could make their way to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Is it normal for a single, federal judge, such as Orrick, to be able to <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/politics/how-can-a-judge-override-an-executive-order/398768463" rel="noopener noreferrer">block</a> the president with their decision? Here's what you need to know to understand how one individual has the authority to block the president.</p>
<h2>1. Article III of the Constitution grants this power directly</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript" rel="noopener noreferrer">Article III of the Constitution</a> states that federal courts may only decide executive order cases where “Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.”</p>

<p>The plaintiff, be it individual, group, or state, must be able to claim a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-vulnerabilities-in-the-ninth-circuits-executive-order-decision" rel="noopener noreferrer">real injury</a> when attacking an executive order. Additionally, plaintiffs&nbsp;must be careful about where they file their case. A lawsuit will often originate in a court where it is likely the judge will rule in their favor.</p>

<p>However, cases can also be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which has the final decision.</p>
<h2>2. District judges are appointed by presidents for life,&nbsp;and ideology plays a crucial role</h2>
<p>Each district judge is <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/gov/9d.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">appointed</a> for a life term, making it impossible for any single president to nominate all of these judges in their term(s). Thus, district court judges are appointed by <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/gov/9d.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">both</a> Republican and Democratic presidents.</p>

<p>Judge Orrick is one of 714 U.S. district court judges who are nominated by the president and then approved by the Senate. Orrick was appointed&nbsp;by President Barack Obama, who he <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/04/judge-william-h-orrick-political-beliefs-party-barack-obama-donate-planned-parenthood-immigration-case-donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> donated to and fundraised for during the 2008 campaign.</p>

<p>Since the Republican Senate refused to confirm many of Obama’s nominations, President Donald Trump will have the chance to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/20/520862742/trump-faces-challenge-of-filling-over-100-federal-court-vacancies" rel="noopener noreferrer">appoint over 100 judges</a> to district and appeals courts.</p>
<h2>3.&nbsp;While district judges do have the ability to stop executive orders, it is unusual</h2>
<p>While the courts do have the power to declare an executive order illegal or unconstitutional, they <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/317878-executive-orders-give-trump-lots-of-power-but-there-are" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not regularly</a> overturn presidential actions. According to author William G. Howell in his <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7658.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> on the subject of executive actions, in his attempt to list every challenged executive order between 1945-1998, he found that the courts ruled in favor of the president in&nbsp;83% of cases.</p>

<p>Still, it takes only <em>one</em> judge in <em>one</em> district court to <a href="https://qz.com/898683/can-an-executive-order-be-revoked/" rel="noopener noreferrer">block</a> an executive order made by the President of the United States.</p>
