<p>The documentary filmmaker and author that many in media accuse&nbsp;of being in the "alt-right," Mike Cernovich, made a prediction on his Twitter feed Thursday about the "Big Center," a massive new political movement Cernovich believes will make a mark in 2020.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/855092758440226817</p>

<p>Marijuana decriminalization. No Wall St. bailouts. Student loan reform. It sounds reminiscent of the type of message <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a> brought to the 2016 presidential election. But Cernovich doesn't believe Sanders will be the one to lead the new&nbsp;movement. No, he says someone else "very smart is going to walk right through the Big Center."</p>

<p>And Tulsi has something going for her that no one else in the Democratic or Republican Party has -- certainly no one in the DNC: She can bridge the partisan divide. She has support from Berniecrats and Trump supporters. From center-left Democrats and center-right Republicans. From the "alt-right" and the "alt-left."</p>

<p>Gabbard is also leading the effort on a number of these issues in Congress. She has stood up for <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/03/03/tulsi-gabbard-states-rights-pot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">states' rights on marijuana</a>. She hasn't backed down on voicing her opinion on issues like&nbsp;U.S. intervention in Syria, taking positions that are <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/04/10/former-clinton-s-delegate-howard-dean-blasts-tulsi-for-syria-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuked</a> by the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/01/27/tulsi-gabbard-attacked-partisans-media-peace-seeking-mission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leadership of both parties</a>.</p>

<p>She is also on the same page as Bernie Sanders on the issue of Wall St. bailouts and student loan reform -- issues that attracted a swell of grassroots support for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Cernovich's prediction may not be off, and it is not like there aren't people already calling on Tulsi to run in 2020.</p>
