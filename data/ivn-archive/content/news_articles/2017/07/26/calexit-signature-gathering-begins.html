<p>There is an important update in the most recent effort in California to secede from theUnited States.</p>

<p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra&nbsp;has cleared the campaign behind the secession initiative to start collecting the 585,000-plus signatures required to make it onto the 2018 ballot. Supporters&nbsp;of the plan&nbsp;have 180 days&nbsp;to collect the signatures.</p>

<p>An earlier signature drive for a similar initiative failed in April.</p>

<p>The initiative's fiscal analysis says it would cost the state at least $1.25 million a year for an advisory commission to assist the governor on California's independence plus "unknown, potentially major, fiscal effects if California voters approved changes to the state’s relationship with the United States."</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The (CalExit) initiative's fiscal analysis says it would cost the state at least $1.25 million a year" author="Jeff Powers, IVN Author"]

<p>The latest proposed initiative does not call for immediate secession. Instead, it forms a commission to examine the best strategies for California to pursue independence, plus deletes part of the state constitution that declares California an inseparable part of the US.</p>

<p>The campaign to make&nbsp;<span><span>California</span></span>&nbsp;an independent nation is also the title of a <strong>new comic book.</strong></p>

<div>
<div>The book’s description from Black Mask Studios describes the world’s seventh-largest&nbsp;<span><span>economy</span></span>&nbsp;paralyzed by “resistance” to the president:</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>“What if the day after that President took power, the largest mass demonstration in history occurred, and the state with the largest turnout was California. And then, the following week, two of the largest international airports in the world, California’s LAX and SFO, were blockaded by protesters? What if California refused to be ruled?”</em></div>
</div>
<p>As expected, reaction to the movement sparked some pretty comical tweets on social media.</p>

<p>The state’s critics celebrated the proposal, others raised logistical concerns over a potential exit from the U.S.</p>
