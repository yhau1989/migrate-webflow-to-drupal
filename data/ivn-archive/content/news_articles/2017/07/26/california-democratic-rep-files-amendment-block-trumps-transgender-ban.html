<p>US Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif) blasted President Trump's announcement that transgender individuals will be banned from military service. He filed <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/sites/scottpeters.house.gov/files/PetersTransgenderBanAmendment.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">an amendment</a>&nbsp;to the Department of Defense appropriations bill Wednesday to block it.</p>

<p>“I can’t think of anything more backwards than turning away a brave, qualified American who wants to serve in our all-volunteer military because of their gender identity," says Peters.</p>

<p>Trump made the announcement over Twitter:</p>

<p>Peters reported in a press release that a <a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/rand-review/2016/08/transgender-troops-fit-to-serve.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAND study</a> commissioned by the Pentagon found there are&nbsp;between 1,320 and 6,630 "transgender individuals serving on active duty in the U.S. military."</p>

<p>"It is not clear how those service members will be treated under this new policy," the press release adds. "The study also found that lifting that ban on the enlistment of transgender Americans would have a negligible impact on readiness, and no significant effect on cohesion or effectiveness."</p>

<p>“Just as we did with the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Congress must stand up against backwards politics, trust our military leaders, and put national security first,” Peters remarks.</p>
