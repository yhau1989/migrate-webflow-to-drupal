<p>President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> and French President <a href="/tag/emmanuel-macron" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> made headlines before Bastille Day in Paris, France.</p>

<p>Several topics were addressed during a brief news conference in Paris, including Syria, the Paris Accord, and Russia.</p>

[heading title="Syria" subtitle=""]

<p>Trump and Macron announced a second ceasefire is about to be implemented in Syria. Trump noted the first one has been in place "for 5 days and is working very well."</p>

<p>The first cease fire came after meetings Russian President Vladimir Putin had with both President Macron and President Trump. Macron said he had two "very long meetings with President Putin at the G20 Summit."</p>

<p>President Trump noted the second cease fire will likely impact a region closer to the capital of Damascus.</p>

[heading title="Paris Accord" subtitle=""]

<p>President Trump suggested he might change his position on the Paris Climate Accord, after talks with Macron.</p>

<p>"Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord," he said. "We'll see what happens."</p>

<p>Macron stated he would love to have the United States remain in the pact, and noted the financial challenges the accord brings to the US.</p>

<p>"We appreciate and respect the president's position and hope we can negotiate a reasonable solution," the French president&nbsp;noted.</p>

[heading title="Russia" subtitle=""]

<p>Questions about Donald Trump. Jr's meeting with a Russian attorney were also raised.</p>

<p>President Trump again defended his son saying, "This was billed as opposition research, which is standard for politics."</p>

<p>He continued, "And nothing came from the meeting, I just learned that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch may have let this attorney into the United States without a current visa, so that's something we will be looking at."</p>

<p>The visa issue was highlighted in an exclusive story from <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/341788-exclusive-doj-let-russian-lawyer-into-us-before-she-met-with-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a>, noting the timeline and meetings the lawyer took in her brief stint in the country.</p>

<p>Presidents Trump and Macron will celebrate Bastille Day ceremonies and a military parade down the Champs-Elysees that, for the first time, will be led by US troops.</p>

<p>About 200 troops from US European Command will have the honor of leading the parade to mark the centennial of the US entry into World War I in 1917.</p>
