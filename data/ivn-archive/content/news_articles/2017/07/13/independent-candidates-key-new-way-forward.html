<p><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong><strong>&nbsp;–</strong>&nbsp;Against the backdrop of dysfunctional government, widespread economic uncertainty, and a general failure of the two-party system to solve many of the nation’s most pressing challenges, a crop of Independent elected officeholders Wednesday&nbsp;came together to make the case that independent candidates for public office can get elected and bridge the political divide between Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<p>“The two major parties don’t agree on much except to make it very difficult for anyone else to compete, yet it’s becoming increasingly clear that a growing number of Americans are ready to embrace a new way. There is something happening out there,” said <strong>Nick Troiano</strong>, executive director of <a href="http://centristproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Centrist Project</strong></a>, at an event held Wednesday morning&nbsp;at the National Press Club.</p>

<p>He added, “We believe a new pathway will emerge, and we are committed to building the electoral infrastructure to help independent candidates win election.”</p>

<p>The event was headlined by Alaska Governor <strong>Bill Walker</strong>, one of the country’s highest-profile elected leaders not affiliated with either major political party.</p>

<p>“It’s easier to make hard decisions as an independent,” said Walker, who came into office facing a historic fiscal crisis brought on by a sharp drop in oil prices that resulted in an 80% reduction in state revenue. “Independents are looked upon as problem solvers. That is what’s causing this change in Alaska.”</p>

<p>Two independent state Representatives&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centristproject.org/grenn?e=2af270cb0b123d660a190abfe88c8ca9e4762780&amp;utm_source=centristproject&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=idadvisory&amp;n=2&amp;test_email=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">helped flip control</a>&nbsp;of the Alaska state house for the first time in decades from the GOP to a new bipartisan governing majority, which has been instrumental in putting forward balanced and bipartisan proposals to address the state’s budget deficits.</p>

<p>“Without a party, I was forced to go door-to-door and have conversations with all my neighbors, regardless of party affiliation,” said state Representative <strong>Jason Grenn</strong>, a participant in Wednesday's event.</p>
<p><em>“When you [campaign] as an independent, it forces people to ask you questions. When you’re a Republican or a Democrat, it puts you in a box in the minds of a lot of people.” - Alaska State Rep. Jason Grenn</em></p>
<p>In Maine, since two independent state representatives were elected in 2016, three incumbent state representatives –– one Republican and two Democrats ––&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centristproject.org/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Fivn.us%2F2017%2F05%2F31%2Findependents-now-control-balance-power-maine%2F&amp;e=2af270cb0b123d660a190abfe88c8ca9e4762780&amp;utm_source=centristproject&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=idadvisory&amp;n=3&amp;test_email=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped their party affiliation</a>.</p>

<p>Now, neither party controls an outright majority in the Maine state house. The independents have been outspoken in advocating for structural political reform, including protecting a <a href="/tag/rcv-maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranked Choice Voting ballot measure</a> passed by Maine voters last year.</p>

<p>“I didn’t need a party affiliation to learn the issues and form an opinion,” said Maine state Representative <strong>Owen Casas</strong>, who spoke about the role he played in advancing a major piece of legislation in Augusta simply by resolving to break the partisan gridlock between elected Republicans and Democrats and engaging in constructive dialogue.</p>

<p>“It took one person to walk around and talk to people,” he added.</p>
