[heading title="Health Care Reform Vote" subtitle=""]

<p>Senate Republicans threw a curveball into the complicated Obamacare repeal vote. The GOP introduced yet <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ERN17500.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">another amendment</a> to their bill to replace the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p>The new version, posted on a Senate website, removes the so-called Cruz amendment. Authored by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the amendment would have allowed insurers to sell much-less-generous, and hence less expensive, individual health plans.</p>
<div>It's&nbsp;not clear if that amendment will remain out of the bill as Senate Republican leaders continue to struggle for 50 votes.</div>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office, in an analysis of the new version of the bill, <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52941" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52941">estimated it would lead to 22 million more Americans lacking health insurance by 2026</a> than would be uninsured if Obamacare remained in its current form.</p>

<p>Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell says he will submit a procedural vote on repealing Obamacare next week.</p>

[heading title="Development Coming in Debate Commission Lawsuit" subtitle=""]

<p>Last February, a federal court judge <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/02/federal-judge-rules-federal-election-commission-decision-pave-way-new-kind-presidential-election-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued an unprecedented ruling</a> that could open the way in 2020 for the first serious challenge in decades by an independent candidate for president.</p>

<p>In the blistering 28-­‐page decision, Judge Tanya Chutkan told the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that in its rejection of a complaint by Level the Playing Field, a non-­‐profit group trying to open up debates to a third candidate, it had acted in a manner that was “arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.”</p>

<p>Fast forward now to July, and the FEC is expected to respond to a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/30/legal-battle-against-presidential-debate-commission-rages-on/" rel="noopener noreferrer">second complaint filed</a> by Level the Playing Field next week. Based on the FEC response, the stage will be set for the next big battle.</p>

[heading title="John McCain Says He'll 'Be Back Soon' to the Senate" subtitle=""]

<p>Sen. John McCain on Twitter Thursday announced he will be "back soon" in Congress, after his brain tumor diagnosis shook Washington, D.C., Wednesday night.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/888057312992260097</p>

<p>McCain&nbsp;has glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. The news has devastated many of his colleagues, including members of the opposite party. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) said he was "in tears" when he heard the news.</p>

<p>Many in Washington describe McCain as a Senate institution, and one of the body's most powerful members. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), noted that McCain was in the Senate when he arrived in the city as an intern.</p>

<p>"I cam here to the Senate in 1987 as an intern, and he was here then," Flake said. "I've never known the Senate without John."</p>
