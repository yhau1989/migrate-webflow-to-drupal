<p>There is big news for the Libertarian Party: It can add one more state where it has official party status and ballot access for the 2018 midterms.</p>

<p>Ballot Access News <a href="http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/10/arkansas-secretary-of-state-says-libertarian-party-petition-is-valid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Monday</a> that&nbsp;the LP's petition for party status was validated by the Arkansas secretary of state on July 7. This means the Libertarian Party has ballot access in 39&nbsp;states, plus the District of Columbia for some or all races in the midterm elections.</p>

<p>The 11&nbsp;states where the LP does not have ballot access:&nbsp;Alabama, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.</p>

Over 4 million voters cast a libertarian vote in 2016. According to a previous report on IVN, that quadrupled the party's previous turnout high.</p>
