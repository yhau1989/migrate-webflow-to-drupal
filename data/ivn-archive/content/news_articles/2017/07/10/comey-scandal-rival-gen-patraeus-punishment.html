<p>There is big news in the James Comey investigation.</p>

<p>More than half of the memos the former FBI director wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information, according to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/10/comey-memos-reportedly-had-classified-info-trump-says-that-is-so-illegal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviews with officials familiar with the documents</a>.</p>

<p>This revelation raises the possibility that Comey broke his own agency’s rules and ignored the same security protocol that he publicly criticized <span>Hillary Clinton</span>&nbsp;for in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>It has comparisons to former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus. He was sentenced to two years probation and handed a $100,000 fine for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, in the form of notebooks he shared with his lover.</p>

<p>Under the terms of a plea deal, Petraeus, 62, avoided jail time. The charge's maximum possible punishments included a fine of $100,000 and a one-year prison sentence. But prosecutors agreed that Petraeus should serve a two-year probation and pay a fine of $40,000.</p>

<p>It's still way too early to tell what will happen with Comey, but it is important to note, Petraeus shared classified materials with a reporter who was given First&nbsp;Amendment&nbsp;protections from then Attorney General Eric Holder. Comey gave materials to a professor who doesn't enjoy such protections.</p>
