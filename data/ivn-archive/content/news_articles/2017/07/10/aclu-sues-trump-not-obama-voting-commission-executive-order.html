<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-files-federal-lawsuit-over-trump-election-commission-secrecy" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit</a>&nbsp;over the lack of transparency by President Trump’s election commission.</p>

<p>The lawsuit charges the commission with failing to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which is designed to ensure public accountability of all advisory committees.</p>

<p>Curiously though, the ACLU's statement says, "President Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes, yet he promotes the lie that voter fraud is to blame. <em>Trump in turn created the commission via executive order."</em></p>

<p>But when <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/28/executive-order-establishment-presidential-commission-election-administr" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama issued an executive order related to the exact same issue</a>&nbsp;(as noted below) the ACLU was noticeably silent.</p>

<p>In June, the Trump administration announced it would hold it's inaugural meeting on voter fraud and suppression July 19.</p>

<p>ACLU Attorney Sophia Lin Lakin said, “Our election process must be secure, fair, and transparent, yet the commission is conducting its work deep in the shadows, making it alarmingly suspect. The commission is legally required to conduct the people’s business in the light of day.”</p>

<p>The case, <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. Donald Trump</em>, was brought by ACLU National and the ACLU of the District of Columbia. It was filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>The complaint can be found <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/american-civil-liberties-union-v-donald-trump-complaint" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
