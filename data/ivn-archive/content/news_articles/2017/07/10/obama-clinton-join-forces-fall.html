<p>Hillary Clinton is ready for a role in next year's midterm elections.</p>

<p>What that role is exactly is not quite clear.</p>

<p>Clinton has already launched a PAC aimed at helping congressional Democratic candidates in 2018, signaling the former first lady, senator and secretary of State is ready to help her party with fundraising.</p>

<p>She also is looking at the House districts she won in last year’s presidential contest against <span>Donald Trump</span> as part of an autopsy of her failed campaign, according to two sources who have spoken to the former secretary of State.</p>

<p>The news comes on the heels that Barack Obama will make the first official political move of his post-presidency on Thursday, headlining a private fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee at a private home in Washington.</p>

<p>The event, which will also be attended by NDRC chair Eric Holder and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, is to help a group backed by Obama to coordinate Democratic efforts in state races and lawsuits to push back on Republican success in gerrymandering over many cycles.</p>

<p>In many statehouses and Congress, that’s left Democrats at a baked-in disadvantage.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if Hillary and Barack join forces in the fall.</p>
