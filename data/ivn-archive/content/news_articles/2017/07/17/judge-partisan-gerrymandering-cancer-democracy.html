<p><em><strong>"A cancer on our democracy."</strong></em></p>

<p>Those are&nbsp;the words U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar used to describe the two-party gerrymandering scheme going on in Maryland and across the country.</p>

<p>A US district court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/judges-in-md-redistricting-case-decry-politically-motivated-electoral-map/2017/07/14/33b44fc2-6814-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html?tid=ss_mail&amp;utm_term=.12ee6b90b585" rel="noopener noreferrer">sided with GOP voters Friday</a>, describing Maryland's&nbsp;redistricting process as "nefarious activity." They found sufficient evidence that the Democratic majority drew district boundaries to make it easier to knock out a GOP incumbent and take all, but one congressional seat.</p>

<p>It is the second time in the past year a panel of federal judges has expressed an opinion condemning the political motivations behind electoral mapmaking.</p>

<p>The first case, <a href="/tag/wisconsin-redistricting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Whitford v. Gill</em></a> out of Wisconsin, is currently before the Supreme Court. A lower&nbsp;court ruled that state legislative boundaries&nbsp;were so partisan that they violated the voting rights of voters outside the Republican Party and thus were unconstitutional.</p>

<p>However, in this case the judges were divided on whether or not the legislature should have to redraw&nbsp;one or more of Maryland's congressional districts. There is no indication when an official ruling might be handed down.</p>

<p>Gerrymandering is often portrayed in the media as solely a Republican problem, yet when one looks at states like <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/07/17/gerrymandering-wisconsin-bad-illinois-worse/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois</a> and&nbsp;Maryland it is important to remember that Democrats are just as guilty. Partisan gerrymandering is a two-party scheme to suppress the voice of those&nbsp;outside the party in power.</p>
