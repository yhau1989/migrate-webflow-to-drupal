<p>California is one of the least affordable states to live. And it appears it's about to get a little more expensive for residents.</p>

<p>Rolling back regulations for developers is a path the legislature could have taken to make building homes more cost effective. But the California State Senate instead passed a bill that will tax real estate transaction documents.</p>

<p>The new fee is expected to generate between $200 and $300 million for affordable housing.</p>

<p>The legislation, authored by Senator Toni Atkins of San Diego, would impose a minimum of$75 fee on documents such as deeds and notices, with a cap of $225 per transaction.</p>

<p>It passed 27-12 with all Democratic votes, and now heads to the Assembly.</p>

<p>Affordable housing is a serious issue in California, with prices reaching all-time highs in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Lawmakers are pushing a series of bills aimed at spurring more building of low-cost housing.</p>

<p>Atkins said, "When you use this money to build more housing, you generate more income, more tax, more jobs, and it helps spur the economy. This will make a difference for middle income families."</p>

<p>Republican opponents disagreed, saying it would hurt middle class people trying to buy homes.</p>

<p>"I want to solve that problem, but I can't do it on the backs of the emerging people who have worked hard, trying to get their first house or move their family into a home that would accommodate their growing family," said&nbsp;Senator Joel Anderson.</p>

<p>Several Republicans said the Legislature should roll back regulations on housing construction instead of passing Atkins' bill.</p>

<p>A number of housing bills are advancing through the Legislature, but none have passed both houses and secured Brown's signature.</p>
