<p>This week, T.J. is joined by Adam Gordon, local San Diegan attorney, who previously served as a Deputy District Attorney in the San Diego County District Attorney’s office.</p>



<p>The two discuss election reform and criminal justice - including campaign contributions, free speech, body-worn cameras, over-criminalization, asset forfeiture, and more.</p>
