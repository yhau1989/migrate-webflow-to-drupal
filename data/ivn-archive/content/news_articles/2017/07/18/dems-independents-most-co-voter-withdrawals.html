<p>Hundreds of Republican and independent&nbsp;voters in <a href="/tag/colorado" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colorado</a> are among the nearly 4,000 people who have canceled their voter registrations&nbsp;in the wake of the Trump administration’s request for voter information.</p>

<p>The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/07/14/co-election-officials-never-seen-exodus-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported last week</a>&nbsp;that 3,738 people withdrew their voter registration between June 28 and Friday, July 14.</p>

<p>Of those <em>367</em> are <strong>Republicans</strong> and <em>1,255</em> are <strong>independent&nbsp;</strong>voters.</p>

<p>Just over <em>2,000</em> <strong>Democrats</strong> have also canceled their registrations.</p>

<p>While that is a large number of cancellations, they are a minuscule fraction of&nbsp;the state’s 3.7 million registered voters.</p>

<p>The withdrawals began in earnest earlier this month, after a presidential advisory commission on election integrity&nbsp;requested publicly available voter information&nbsp;from all 50 states. On July 10 alone,<em> 1,237</em> Colorado voters withdrew their registrations.</p>

<p>Another <em>200</em> Colorado voters have signed up to become “confidential voters,” a designation that allows their information to be withheld.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump established the voter fraud advisory commission with a mandate to review US election integrity, with a focus on voter fraud, voter suppression, and other “vulnerabilities.”</p>

<p>The effort has been plagued by privacy concerns and distrust from the start. The commission now faces 7 lawsuits.</p>

<p>Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams has said he will provide only information considered public under Colorado law, a category that includes voters’ names, addresses, party affiliations, birth years, and which elections they have participated in.</p>

<p>The commission’s request is on hold while a legal challenge plays out in court.</p>
