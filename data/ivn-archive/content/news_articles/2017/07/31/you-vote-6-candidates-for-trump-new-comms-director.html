<p>"The Mooch" is out.</p>

<p>The White House announced Monday that Anthony&nbsp;Scaramucci is out as communications director. The announcement was expected following his <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/anthony-scaramucci-called-me-to-unload-about-white-house-leakers-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon" rel="noopener noreferrer">expletive-laced tirade</a> to a reporter from the New Yorker.</p>

<p>The news also comes after President Trump announced his new chief of staff, General John Kelly. A four star general is not likely to allow that kind of conduct to continue in the Trump administration.</p>

<p>So who will be the next White House&nbsp;communications&nbsp;director?</p>

<p>The smart money may be&nbsp;on someone with a military background. However, there are other qualified candidates President Tump could consider for the post, including people with White House experience and big names in business.</p>
