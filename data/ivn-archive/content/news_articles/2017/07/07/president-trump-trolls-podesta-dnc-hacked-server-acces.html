<p>The back and forth between President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager <strong>John Podesta</strong> continues.</p>

<p>The battle rages over the hacked DNC server, and questions as to why it still hasn’t been turned over to the DHS and FBI for review, if in fact a crime was committed as Podesta and the intelligence community maintains.</p>

<p>The private company CrowdStrike, hired by the Democratic Party, remains the only group to have had access to the server.</p>

<p>President Trump is in Hamburg, Germany at the G20 Summit where he tweeted:</p>

<p>John Podesta, who had a rather <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9U5zxVyTqA" rel="noopener noreferrer">tense interview on Fox Business</a> last week, tweeted back at the president:</p>

<p>Former Obama campaign manager David Axelrod was critical of the president, tweeting:</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/27/cnn-covering-for-dnc-corruption/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an IVN article</a> in June, and this <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/5/dnc-email-server-most-wanted-evidence-for-russia-i/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Times article this week</a>, it is a legitimate question: Did Russia hack the DNC servers, gain access to sensitive DNC emails, and then leak them to WikiLeaks?</p>

<p>For his part, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has <a href="http://time.com/4620806/julian-assange-russia-hack-fox-hannity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated many times</a> the Russian state was&nbsp;not involved in the hack. Respected think tanks have also thrown shade at CrowdStrike’s assertion that Russia hacked the DNC server.</p>

<p>Even members of Congress are now reportedly raising questions about why the DNC has never allowed investigators to look at the server, which is a key piece of evidence. Putin re-asserted in his meeting with Trump that his government was not responsible for the hacks.</p>

<p>Podesta, the DNC, and CNN all strongly disagree.</p>

<p>Stay tuned. Watch the Fox News business interview with John Podesta below:</p>
