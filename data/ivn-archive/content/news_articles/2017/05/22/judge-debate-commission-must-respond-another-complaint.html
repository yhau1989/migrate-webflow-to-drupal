<p>On Monday, Federal Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the D.C. District Court granted plaintiffs' motion to file another brief -- a supplemental complaint -- in the case, <em>Level the Playing Field, et. al. v. FEC</em>. Once again, the FEC will be forced to respond after it dodged the original complaint against the Commission on Presidential Debates for a second time.</p>

<p>Level the Playing Field, joined by the national Libertarian and Green Parties, filed a lawsuit in 2016 challenging the nonprofit status of the Commission on Presidential Debates on the basis that it is not nonpartisan nor does it use “objective criteria” to determine entry into presidential debates.</p>

<p>Chutkan's order states that the FEC will have 60 days to respond to the supplemental complaint. Stay tuned for further developments.</p>
