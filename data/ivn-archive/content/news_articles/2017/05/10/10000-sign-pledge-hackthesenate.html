<p>With a government as dysfunctional and polarized as ours, the question is often asked: “Why are there not more independent lawmakers in office?”</p>
<p>Pundits will often offer the answer that it is because A) most Americans have a partisan slant, and B) independent candidates would not have the support or resources to win.</p>
<p>But it is starting to look like those responses are no longer true:</p>
<p>A). <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2017/04/17/3-views-of-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent polling</a> shows that a majority of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of both parties, no doubt a result of a bitter and divisive Presidential election.</p>
<p>B). In only a few weeks, the Centrist Project’s&nbsp;<a href="http://pledge.centristproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">#HackTheSenate </a>campaign met its goal of recruiting 10,000 voters to pledge their support to a slate of independent candidates, should they step forward for the 2018 election.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/04/11/centrist-project-hack-the-senate-for-independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">purpose of the campaign</a> was to demonstrate to potential independent U.S Senate candidates that they would have the backing of voters, activists, and donors across the country were they to run.</p>

<p>The Centrist Project aims to help elect these independent candidates so that they can band together, deny both parties a majority in the U.S. Senate, and restore common sense to government –– essentially a “hack” to the two-party system.</p>
<p>Our country is clearly ready for a change and The Centrist Project’s “hack” can be what makes that change happen.</p>
