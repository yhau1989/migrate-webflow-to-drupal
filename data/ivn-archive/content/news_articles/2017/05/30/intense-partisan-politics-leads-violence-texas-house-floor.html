<p>Chaos, protests, and threats of violence marked the ending of the 85th Texas legislative session. Emotions reached the boiling point over a statewide ban on sanctuary cities passed by the Texas Legislature, and signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration and sanctuary cities have&nbsp;become intensely partisan issues, from the local and state level, to Congress and the White House.</p>

<p>But protests were only the start Monday, ahead of Sine Die (session adjournment), when a&nbsp;scuffle between lawmakers on the House floor reportedly ended with one saying, "<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2017/05/29/fistfight-nearly-erupts-final-day-caps-contentious-legislative-session" rel="noopener noreferrer">I will put a bullet in your head</a>."</p>

<p>The incident involved five&nbsp;lawmakers in particular: Republican&nbsp;Matt Rinaldi&nbsp;of Irving, and Democrats&nbsp;Ramon Romero, Phil Cortez, Cesar Blanco, and Pancho Navarez.</p>

<p>Rinaldi reportedly told the Democratic lawmakers&nbsp;he called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)&nbsp;after seeing a sign from one protester that explicitly said the protester was in the state illegally.</p>

<p>Romero, Blanco, and Cortez responded with heated retorts. Both sides claim threats of violence were made against them, a shoving match ensued, and more than one witness says Rinaldi told&nbsp;Navarez that he (Rinaldi) would put a bullet in his (Navarez's) head.</p>

<p>Rinaldi says he responded this way after Navarez implied violence against him in the parking lot. He&nbsp;claims he simply made it clear that if&nbsp;Navarez tried to attack him, he would defend himself.</p>

<p>The story has devolved into mostly finger pointing and both sides making accusations about the other. Texas House Speaker Joe Strauss said in a prepared statement,&nbsp;"There's no excuse for members making insensitive and disparaging remarks on the floor of the Texas House."</p>

<p>Clearly, this went a little further than "insensitive and disparaging" remarks as passions over hot-button, partisan issues&nbsp;resulted in threats of deadly violence and nearly a fist fight between lawmakers involved.</p>
