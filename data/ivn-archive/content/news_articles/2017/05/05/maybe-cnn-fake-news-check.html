<p>Fake news -- it’s a term we often hear about, but don’t often get the opportunity to see examples of just how slanted, biased, and fake the news has become.</p>

<p>Jake Tapper at CNN has been a vocal critic of President Trump, which unto itself, violates the premise of journalism, but CNN lost its way long ago. Indeed, the man in charge of the network says <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/04/17/cnn-president-admits-network-entertainment-journalism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s an entertainment organization</a>, no longer a news organization.</p>

<p>Yossi Gestetner put together a startling video that shows the clear bias and double standard Tapper engages in on his CNN program. It’s most certainly worth viewing.</p>
