<p>Did you know it costs nearly $150,000 to operate Air Force One?</p>

<p>Per HOUR!!!</p>

<p>Kudos to the group Judicial Watch for obtaining records from the Department of the Air Force in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.</p>

<p>The information details how much taxpayers are on the hook for President Trumpâ€™s flights to Mar-a-Lago for two weekends. The total cost is $1,281,420.00.</p>

<p>According to Judicial Watch, the Air Force records show a total of nine hours for trips from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/trump-travel-mar-lago-feb-3-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feb. 3-6</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/trump-travel-mar-lago-march-3-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 3-6</a>. The latter trip includes a stop&nbsp;where the president met Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to tour a private Catholic school in support of school vouchers.</p>
