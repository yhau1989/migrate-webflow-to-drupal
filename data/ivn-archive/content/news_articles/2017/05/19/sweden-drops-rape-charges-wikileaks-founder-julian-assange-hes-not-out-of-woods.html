<p>Reports released Friday morning that Swedish prosecutors have discontinued an investigation into rape allegations against WikiLeaks founder <a href="/tag/julian-assange" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julian Assange</a>.</p>

<p>Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since August 2012 to avoid&nbsp;extradition. At 6:04 am PDT, Assange tweeted his own statement:</p>

<p>There is, however, a snag for Assange. If he leaves the Ecuadorian embassy, UK police will still arrest him. That is because the U.S. is still considering charges against Assange and WikiLeaks for releasing classified information -- most recently on the&nbsp;<a href="/tag/cia" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIA</a>.</p>

<p>For now, it seems Assange will be able to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy pending any possible deal struck between the U.S. and the Ecuadorian government.</p>
