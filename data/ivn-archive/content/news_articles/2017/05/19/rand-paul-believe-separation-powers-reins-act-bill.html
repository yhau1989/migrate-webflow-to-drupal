<p>The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee passed the Regulations from Executives In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act Wednesday, a bill sponsored by U.S. Senator <a href="/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a> (R-Ky.). This is just one bill Paul has sponsored to protect constitutional checks and balances between the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch.</p>

<p>"The REINS Act basically says that any regulation over $100 million will need to come back to have Congress' approval. I think this was the intent of our Founding Fathers that legislation be written that impacts our society, significant legislation be passed by Congress and not just by the Executive Branch, and not just by unelected folks in the Executive Branch," said Paul in a committee meeting.</p>

<p>He later added, "I think if you believe in the separation of powers and that legislation or that things that affect our economy should originate in Congress. This is a great way to have oversight over regulations."</p>

<p>Paul is also co-sponsoring the Justice Safety Valve Act along with Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The re-introduction of the bill came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the DOJ would take a tougher stance on the <a href="/tag/war-on-drugs" rel="noopener noreferrer">War on Drugs</a>.</p>
