<h2><strong>Harvard Media Study: Living in the Age of Extremes </strong></h2>
<p>Harvard University has released <a href="https://heatst.com/culture-wars/harvard-study-reveals-huge-extent-of-anti-trump-media-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new study</a> revealing the remarkable extent the mainstream media has gone to harm President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<p>Academics at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy analyzed coverage from Trump’s first 100 days in office across 10 major TV and print outlets.</p>

<p>Their findings illustrate the steady propaganda efforts to delegitimize the president.</p>

<p>There was one exception: the president received positive coverage for the cruise missile attack on Syria.</p>

<p>When the academics compared Trump with other administrations the differences were stark.</p>

<p>The study found President Barack Obama’s first 100 days got a positive&nbsp;write-up 59% of the time. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush got negative coverage, although to a much lesser extent than Trump.</p>

<p>Clinton’s first 100 days got 40% positivity, while Bush’s got 43%:</p>
