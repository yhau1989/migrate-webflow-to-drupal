<p>At the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/03/politics/james-comey-senate-hearing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee hearing</a> on Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey said a number of curious things, but one comment in particular stood out. When asked about Russian influence in the U.S. election and the ability to combat a foreign actor’s misinformation campaign, the Director said, “We need to arm ourselves with good troll armies pushing back.”</p>

<p>Say what?</p>

<p>It struck me as odd, because I thought it was illegal for the FBI to engage in statewide propaganda efforts as outlined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith-Mundt Act of 1948</a>.</p>

<p>For background purposes, the Smith-Mundt Act was established as a prohibition on domestic dissemination of materials intended for foreign audiences by the State Department, also known as propaganda. The thought, and a good one, was to establish a barrier between government agencies and the media, and for 65 years the act stood unchallenged, given the role propaganda is generally reserved for in empowering dictatorial governments.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2012. Under President Obama, the law was changed with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736/text" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012</a>, an act sponsored by Rep. Mac Thornberry (R- Texas) and Rep. Adam Smith (D- Wash.). The reform was quietly inserted into the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4310/text" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA), and effectively nullified the original 1948 act.</p>

<p>Let's be clear, the original law&nbsp;prohibited U.S. organizations from using state resources, including the intelligence community, to influence&nbsp;public opinion of United States citizens. Obama’s reform to the Smith-Mundt Act allowed the American public to be a target audience of U.S. government-funded information campaigns.</p>

<p>The purpose of the repeal, ostensibly, was to disseminate foreign policy related information. However, in the midst of a presidential campaign that threatened to transfer control over the government itself to a new party with a vastly different agenda, it would be far-fetched to think the establishment wouldn’t use this newfound power to influence the domestic election.</p>

<p>Have you really been watching the “news,” or have you been the recipient of state-sponsored propaganda? There’s no way to know.</p>

<p>How many “news correspondents” and “contributors” are also on the government payroll? No way to know that either.</p>

<p>So the question is, will President Trump reinstate the Smith-Mundt Act? If so, this would seem to fly right in the face of claims that Trump is the biggest threat to journalism and democracy itself.</p>

<p>This story will not be disseminated by the mainstream media.</p>
