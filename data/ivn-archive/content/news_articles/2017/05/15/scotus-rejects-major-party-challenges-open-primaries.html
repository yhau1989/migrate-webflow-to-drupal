<p>The AP <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-15/justices-reject-challenge-to-hawaii-montana-open-primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Monday</a> that the Supreme Court has rejected two cases challenging open primaries in <a href="/tag/montana" rel="noopener noreferrer">Montana</a> and <a href="/tag/hawaii" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawaii</a>. The justices did not comment on their decision to leave the Ninth Circuit's rulings in place.</p>

<p>The majority parties in both states -- Democratic Party of Hawaii and Republican committees in Montana -- filed a legal challenge against the open primary laws in their respective states, which allow voters to choose a party ballot on primary election day without consideration of their party affiliation.</p>

<p>In both cases, lower courts ruled that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence that their constitutional rights were severely burdened by open primaries; specifically, their First Amendment right to association.</p>

<p>For now, the high court is staying out of the legal challenges to primary elections. In 2015, the Supreme Court rejected <a href="https://ivn.us/2015/07/08/ivp-scotus-parties-not-power-people/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a challenge to closed primaries</a> in New Jersey brought by a coalition of nonpartisan organizations and individual plaintiffs, led by the <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a>.</p>
