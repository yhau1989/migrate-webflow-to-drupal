<p>But seriously, why on earth do we have the Electoral College? Something about having to travel in carriages?</p>

<p>It's a question a lot of people are asking after an election with a pretty big gap between the popular vote and the outcome.</p>

<p>So why on earth does it exist? What's the point? Is it fulfilling its purpose? What alternatives are there, and how would we get to them?</p>

<p>Learn all this and more, including why you don't kill your admirals, on today's episode!</p>
