<p>On Tuesday, <a href="http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Campaign Legal Center</a> released a statement expressing&nbsp;its disappointment that Hillary Clinton's new 501(c)(4), Onward Together, will not commit to donor disclosure. The Campaign Legal Center says this&nbsp;breaks Hillary's campaign promise to "end secret, unaccountable money in politics."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/news/press-releases/onward-together-breaks-clinton-s-promise-end-secret-unaccountable-money-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> reads:</p>
<blockquote><em>On Monday, Sec. Hillary Clinton announced that she was launching a new political 501(c)(4) group, Onward Together. Staffers for the new group suggested it will not disclose the names of its donors. <strong>Larry Noble, senior director, regulatory reform programs and general counsel at Campaign Legal Center (CLC)</strong> released the following statement about the importance of disclosure to the ongoing health of our democracy:</em>

“It is disappointing that Sec. Hillary Clinton – who ran on a platform to “end secret, unaccountable money in politics” – would break the spirit of <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/campaign-finance-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">her own promise</a> by starting a new dark money group to allow her to raise unlimited funds from secret donors. Disclosure is critical because voters deserve to know if our leaders will answer to them, or to wealthy special interest groups and donors. Transparency is the foundation of an open democracy. Clinton’s group is following a dangerous path that could further open the floodgates to even more unaccountable money in politics.”</blockquote>
<p>The Campaign Legal Center linked to Hillary's own campaign website, where it says, "We need federal legislation to require outside groups to publicly disclose significant political spending." Clinton also ran on making Citizens United a top priority in her first 100 days.</p>

<p>The Young Turks devoted a segment of their broadcast to the subject on Tuesday as well. The video can be seen above.</p>
