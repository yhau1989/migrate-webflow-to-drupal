<p>In an exclusive interview with NBC, President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> said the investigation must go on, saying he wants it “absolutely done properly." That was echoed under oath by the acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who said the president has done “nothing to impede the investigation.”</p>

<p>In the same interview, Trump also noted he had decided to fire FBI Director James Comey well before any recommendation to do so. "I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it."</p>

<p>In a bit of a surprise Mr. Trump also offered this, “I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people. He’s the wrong man for that position.'"</p>

<p>It’s no doubt extremely important for Democrats to keep Russia in the news. For several reasons:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The thought it will help them in the ’18 and ’20 elections;</li>
 	<li>It delegitimizes the president and his agenda; and</li>
 	<li>It keeps Mr. Trump distracted</li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Democrats are hoping this Russia talk and investigation will bring new found energy to a party that desperately needs it.</p>

<p>The election gutted the party and they are now trying to get back on their feet and reestablish their national platform by tearing down the president and his constituents.</p>
