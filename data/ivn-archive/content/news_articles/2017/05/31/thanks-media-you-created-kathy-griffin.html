<p>Thanks New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, and FOX News... you created Kathy Griffin.</p>

<p>When an 11-year-old boy turned on a television yesterday in New York City and saw what he thought was his father actually beheaded, congratulations, you were&nbsp;responsible for his terror.</p>

<p>You used to be our "true north."</p>

<p>You used to be the folks we could count on to make reasonable and logical assessments of our world.</p>

<p>You used to be the&nbsp;folks who had&nbsp;unprecedented access to newsmakers and worked diligently to ensure all points of view were&nbsp;respected and reported.</p>

<p>You are no longer that.</p>

<p>Your obsession with innuendo, anonymous sources, Russia, and clickbait has led to candy-coated journalism and the birth of <a href="/tag/fake-news" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake news</a>.</p>

<p>You created Kathy Griffin.</p>

<p>Never mind the <a href="/tag/dnc-lawsuit" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNC lawsuit</a>, the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/05/30/obama-admin-illegal-spying-worse-than-watergate-glenn-reynolds-column/102284058/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama spying scandal</a>, and the push to find those who actually <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/leaking-highly-classified-foreign-intel-is-darn-close-to-treason-homeland-security-secretary-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked classified information</a>. No, your 24/7 obsession with de-legitimizing the duly-elected President of the United States is tired and nauseating.</p>

<p>First Lady Melania Trump said it best:</p>
<blockquote>"As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing. When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong."</blockquote>
<p>Our society is steamrolling far away from civility, respect, and decorum, and the media is largely responsible.</p>

<p>The media's&nbsp;sick and twisted obsession with&nbsp;taking down the president has crossed a barrier so grotesque, even the First&nbsp;Amendment has called for a timeout.</p>

<p><strong>Watch Kathy Griffin's apology:</strong></p>
