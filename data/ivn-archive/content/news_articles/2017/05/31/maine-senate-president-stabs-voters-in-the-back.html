<h2>Maine Senate President Thibodeau (R-Waldo County) DENIES consideration of&nbsp;Rep. Ackley’s RCV bill.</h2>
<p>Wow. Michael Thibodeau, Republican senator from Waldo County and president of the Senate, just gave&nbsp;Rep. Kent Ackley and Maine voters a major league shaft. He&nbsp;<strong>denied</strong>&nbsp;permission to circulate a ballot among the Legislative Council for Ackley’s bill&nbsp;to make <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a> (RCV)&nbsp;constitutional.</p>

<p>Ackley’s RCV bill would pave the way for&nbsp;ranked choice voting -- as approved by <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/09/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-celebrate-historic-victory-in-maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">53% of Maine voters last November</a>&nbsp;-- to be used in&nbsp;primary and federal elections, but not for statewide general elections, which the Supreme Court said are <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/23/breaking-maine-supreme-court-says-ranked-choice-voting-unconstitutional/" rel="noopener noreferrer">constitutionally out of bounds</a>.</p>

<p>Ackley’s bill simply upholds what the voters wanted – outside of statewide general elections.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago, Legislative Council unanimously approved two opposing RCV bills to go to the legislature for discussion and votes.</p>

<p><em>I have phone calls in to both Senate Democrats and Sen Thibodeau’s office and am awaiting further details.</em></p>
