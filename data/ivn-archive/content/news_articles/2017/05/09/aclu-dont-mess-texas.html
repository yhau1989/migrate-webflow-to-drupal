<p>In an extraordinary move, the ACLU, a non-profit, has issued a “travel warning” for the state of Texas. The image, created by the ACLU, warns that authorities could engage in among other things, “illegal arrests” and “racial profiling.”</p>

<p>The “travel warning” is a reaction to the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott signing into law last week a bill that eliminates Sanctuary City laws from the state of Texas.</p>

<p>The new law allows law-enforcement officers to ask anyone they detain, even in a traffic stop, about their immigration status. The ACLU says this will lead to “widespread racial profiling, baseless scrutiny, and illegal arrests of citizens and non-citizens alike presumed to be “foreign” based on how they look or sound.”</p>

<p>SB4 also requires local law-enforcement officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities who request they detain people suspected of being in the US illegally.</p>
