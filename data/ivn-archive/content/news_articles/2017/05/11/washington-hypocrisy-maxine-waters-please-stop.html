<p><strong>Exhibit "A" Why Voter's Don't Trust Washington.</strong></p>

<p>CA Rep. Maxine Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of President Trump. Her colorful language is certainly made for the 24-hour MSM headline-craving industry.</p>

<p>But Waters' response to Mr. Trump's firing of James Comey is a great example of the hypocrisy and double talk occurring in Washington now. On January 13, Waters stated, "The FBI director (Comey) has no credibility." She then stormed out of the room.</p>

<p>On May 10, when the president dismissed Director Comey, Waters took a much different tone. When asked if she supported the president's decision to fire Comey Waters said, "No, I do not."</p>

<p>But wait, it gets more surreal.&nbsp;When asked if Hillary Clinton had won the White&nbsp;House, and she removed Comey would that be ok with Waters? She said, "She should have fired him, Yes!"</p>

<p>So it's fine that HRC fires Comey, but not ok that Trump did the same.</p>

<p>And you wonder why Congress is so unpopular. And no, the president is NOT under investigation.</p>
