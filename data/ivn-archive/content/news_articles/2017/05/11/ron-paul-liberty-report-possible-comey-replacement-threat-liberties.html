<p>The Ron Paul Liberty report staff penned an opinion piece Thursday that says one person President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> is considering to replace James Comey as FBI director goes against the president's promise to <strong>#DrainTheSwamp</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, according to the op-ed, he may be part of the swamp and a threat to American liberties.</p>
<blockquote>The White House confirmed that former Congressman <strong>Mike Rogers</strong> from Michigan is being considered as James Comey's replacement at the FBI.

The President has tweeted multiple times with the hashtag #DrainTheSwamp when referring to his firing of Comey. But when you look at some of the things that Mike Rogers has supported, it makes you wonder if the president is really serious.

For example. In 2013, Rogers literally said with regards to NSA surveillance programs: "you can't have your privacy violated if you don't know your privacy is violated, right?"

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.</blockquote>
