<p><strong>Two private corporations, whose operatives are <i>not elected</i> by us, control our federal, state, and local elections. They cheat us. They prevent us from having a democracy!</strong> And now, that one of them is hit with a lawsuit for its cheating, the corporate media (who take part in the cheating) don’t even tell us about it. Soon they may, but they will belittle it or defend the undermining of democracy (or our democratic republic, if you want to split hairs) that our Founders risked their lives for and that we have always been told we had.<span></span></p>

<p>And, look, this isn’t some trivial affair! We need democracy to make the changes we badly need. I am talking about changes to the utterly unfair wealth and income inequality which heaps wealth on people who don’t work a day in their lives, while it keeps others struggling all their lives and even lets them die for no other reason than that they have been robbed of too many pieces of green paper by the former group. All because green paper decides who gets health care and who doesn’t, even as our country has enough resources to provide health care for all.</p>

<p>You, who – like me – are part of the people, please don’t ignore this! And if this lawsuit fails <i>(because corruption is the new business model in out society)</i> please commit yourself to be the next person who provides evidence or brings a lawsuit when the next election rigging occurs right under your nose.</p>

<p>Two private corporations control and warp our elections at the behest of their super-rich masters, so that we – the people – never get a true say in our country’s affairs. They are known as the Republican and “Democratic” Party. To wit: their operatives are <i><b>not elected</b></i> by us, but nevertheless manipulate our elections so we only get candidates who never represent us in anything but their lying words. The latter of the two corporations went so far, cheating-wise, last year, that it has been slammed with a lawsuit over it. Finally! No matter what the chances of this lawsuit, this is not a small thing!</p>

<p>Sure, the DNC can have and break all the “internal processes” and bylaws they want, as their lawyers so smugly aver, but when a corporation lies to all Americans in order to get our money, it’s false advertising. It’s FRAUD. That is illegal. That’s what this lawsuit is based on. This class action lawsuit actually defines three groups of victims:</p>
<p>(1) Bernie Sanders supporters who donated to their candidate in publicly financed primaries while the DNC behind the scenes rigged those primaries so he couldn’t come out the winner even if he did win the majority of voters over to his side;</p>
<p>(2) People who donated to the “Democratic” Party believing it to be democratic; and</p>
<p>(3) All the members of the Democratic Party who poured their blood, sweat, and money into this party while the top-level operatives were subverting their party and the democracy it is supposed to support.</p>
<p>The election theft itself (<a href="https://beanstocksworld.wordpress.com/election-fraud-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of evidence, friends!</a>) would be stuff for a criminal lawsuit. Sadly, criminal lawsuits are harder to bring and win because you must track down individual culprits and obtain solid evidence. That is very hard to do in a deeply corrupted system where many participants obstruct both democracy AND investigations.</p>

<p>A civil class action suit is easier to bring, since you merely need to prove the deceit practiced by the whole system (or a major organization like the DNC), not the individual crimes of people who shredded all incriminating evidence long ago or are shielded by their brothers in crime (some of them judges, say those who block access to voting machines so we could have their easily rigged vote counting algorithms checked).</p>

<p>That’s why this civil suit was brought. Not because of some money-making opportunism. Shame on any oligarchy defender in the media who tries to spread this false rumor. It’s a real shame that this should have happened on TYT. It’ll be sure to be done on the real corporate media before long, but that’s no excuse for certain folks on TYT doing it. It’s a sign that TYT is slipping into the corporate media swamp. Rather than for one of them to dump on alternative media folks when they called this out, TYT folks should quickly remember who their supporting audience is and what vital niche they fill.</p>

<p>It’s clear that the DNC (and many state operatives in the “Democratic” Party) cheated us out of the candidate that the majority of American voters wanted and who surely <a href="https://beanstocksworld.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/new-poll-confirms-the-old-polls-bernie-sanders-would-have-trounced-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">would have beaten</a> Donald Trump (the alleged bogeyman of the “Democratic” Party about which its operatives now whine so much).</p>

<p>It’s hard enough for a popular candidate, who may actually do things for working people, to get to run for office in our system where expensive campaigns go to those who receive funding from the billionaires and their corporations and super PACs. It’s something we must urgently change.</p>

<p>But when a candidate manages to overcome this hurdle by millions of us <i>somehow</i> learning of his existence and donating what small amounts we can afford, and a party leadership then bars millions of us from voting and miscounts the rest of the votes in favor for their corrupt godmother, then what chance have we – the people – left to EVER getting the candidate we want to see in office?</p>

<p>In total we have three main killers of democracy in our country:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>An economic system which works as an injustice machine concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.</li>
 	<li>A political system (and mass media) that’s controlled by the wealthy few and makes sure that valid candidates never (or only rarely) make it on our ballots and will stay unknown to voters even if they do.</li>
 	<li>Election rigging (gerrymandering, voter suppression, provisional and mail-in ballots, voting machines, and non-public vote counting…) as a last resort to block people’s candidates.</li>
</ol>
<p>We must overcome all three democracy killers if we are to take back our country and heal our ravaged lives. The first we can try (at least in part) through non-political means — by creating, supporting, and expanding worker co-ops as a much healthier alternative to corporations. The <a href="https://beanstocksworld.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/amazing-speech-about-our-economic-and-political-mess-and-how-to-fix-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer">video I recently shared</a> talks about that. The other two are political and legal fights. We will have to fight many battles to succeed, so any that comes along should be most welcome and supported by us any way we can.</p>
