<p>IVN&nbsp;is excited to bring you this unique opportunity: a powerful new survey “<a href="https://thechisel.com/americandream" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>What’s Your American Dream?</strong></a>” that&nbsp;will bring&nbsp;<em>your</em> voice to&nbsp;Washington.</p>

<p>The survey grew out of discussions with former members of Congress and everyday Americans, all frustrated with being out of touch with each other. In this&nbsp;era of political divide and confusion, a nonpartisan coalition has launched the&nbsp;survey for Americans to express their values and goals to lawmakers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://thechisel.com/americandream" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take the survey here!</a></h2>
<p>As one of the coalition members, IVN hopes&nbsp;this effort will guide the nation’s leaders to&nbsp;understand Americans’ goals. The coalition, comprised of 25 universities, media outlets, and organizations spanning the political spectrum, reaches 30 million Americans.</p>

<p>This survey is unlike any you’ve ever experienced. The American Dream survey allows participants to share their stories with fellow Americans. It is presented like a game, is quick and easy, and you can even add comments.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://thechisel.com/americandream" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>What’s Your American Dream?</strong></a>”is&nbsp;hosted on <a href="http://thechisel.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheChisel.com</a>, a nonpartisan online platform.</p>
<blockquote>“As a nation, we are frustrated and face uncertainties,” said Deborah Devedjian, TheChisel’s founder. “We encourage Americans to step beyond political slogans and platforms to share what matters to you, your loved ones, and communities.”</blockquote>
<p>The survey covers 7 topics critical to America’s future. Each&nbsp;week focuses on&nbsp;one theme. The survey can&nbsp;be completed in several sessions -- 5 minutes once a week for 7 weeks -- or done&nbsp;in one longer&nbsp;session.</p>
