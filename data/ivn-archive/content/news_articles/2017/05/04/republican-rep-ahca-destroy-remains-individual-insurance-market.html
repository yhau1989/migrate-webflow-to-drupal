<p>House Republicans are celebrating a major victory over the Affordable Care Act (colloquially known as Obamacare). The House voted 217-213 on a repeal and replace bill Thursday. However, not every Republican is smiling.</p>

<p>U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was one of 20 Republicans to vote against the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Shortly after the vote, Massie explained his decision on Facebook:</p>



<p>"If this bill becomes law, it could result in worse outcomes, fewer options, and higher prices for Kentuckians who seek health care," said Massie. "In summary, I voted against this bill not because it’s imperfect, but because it’s not good.</p>

<p>For Massie, and a large handful of Republicans, the bill does&nbsp;not go far enough in encouraging a stronger free market approach to health insurance or fully repealing Obamacare. It's one of the big reasons why the Freedom Caucus didn't get behind previous attempts at reform.</p>

<p>For others, the MacArthur Amendment, which was added to win over Republicans worried about provisions on pre-existing conditions, does&nbsp;not go far enough.</p>

<p>If the vote in the House looks close, it may not compare to how close the vote will&nbsp;be in the Senate. Many reports suggest that it will be an uphill battle and the current bill will likely&nbsp;be significantly altered.</p>
