<p>Some of you have been following the Seth Rich death investigation at arms length. Some call it a crazy conspiracy, some say it could be the most important political story of a generation. Others have no idea what I’m talking about, yet.</p>

<p>Here’s the elevator summary:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Seth_Rich" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rich was 27 years old</a> and worked for Bernie Sanders and the Democratic National Committees. On July 10, 2016, Rich was fatally shot about a block from his home in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C, just days before the infamously leaked/hacked DNC emails were published by <a href="/tag/wikileaks" rel="noopener noreferrer">WikiLeaks</a>.</p>

<p>Left-wing media reports stated that Rich was the victim of a botched robbery attempt, although none of his belongings, watch, wallet etc. were taken.</p>

<p>Right-wing media has reported Rich was murdered for sharing internal DNC emails.</p>

<p>According to a federal investigator who reviewed an FBI report detailing forensic evidence on Rich’s computer, Rich had made contact with WikiLeaks through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_MacFadyen" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gavin MacFayden</a>, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time. (MacFayden’s wife says her husband died from lung cancer.) The story goes that Rich sent thousands of emails detailing the DNC’s efforts to undermine the candidacy of Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>On July 22, 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspiring to stop Sanders&nbsp;from becoming the party’s presidential nominee.</p>

<p>As you are likely aware, the DNC's undisputed efforts to thwart Sanders’ candidacy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.</p>

<p>Some Democrats cited the leaks as one explanation for Clinton’s election loss. Many accused the Russians of “hacking” and turning the tide for Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Of the <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36082" rel="noopener noreferrer">emails released</a>, one in particular mentioned&nbsp;the leak. Indeed, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said he&nbsp;would like to “make an example” out of the person who leaked the emails. “I’m definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it,” Podesta wrote on February 22, 2015, according to WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>Since the election on November 8, the media and U.S. Intelligence agencies have focused their lens on Russia, and how the Putin regime allegedly undermined and influenced the outcome in favor of President Trump.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago a private investigator, Rod Wheeler, hired by the Rich family, told FOX5 news in Washington D.C., that he had <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/254852337-story" rel="noopener noreferrer">“seen proof”</a> that Rich had connected with and sent emails to WikiLeaks. 48 hours later he recanted his statement. The Rich family spokesman, <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/05/brad-bauman-seth-rich-dnc-family-democrat-pastorum-group-wikileaks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Bauman</a>, roundly criticized his initial interview. Bauman, the former director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Wheeler is a sociopath, and any media willing to report his nonsense has a clear agenda.</p>

<p>Then this week, an Internet hacker named “Kim Dotcom,” who claims to have been a friend of Rich, stated on his Twitter account that he has proof of Rich’s communication with WikiLeaks and will share it with a nationwide audience Tuesday. Not only that, Dotcom&nbsp;said he would testify to Congress that Rich was responsible for providing the emails, not Russia.</p>

<p>Also this past weekend, Newt Gingrich, as reported in the Washington Post, made a direct statement in a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newt-gingrich-seth-rich_us_5921e432e4b03b485cb24c20" rel="noopener noreferrer">television interview</a> that, “Rich was assassinated, and he was the source of the emails, not Russia.”</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see where this leads. As the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding.&nbsp; And if in fact the proof exists, I think it’s fair to say it will rival the biggest political stories in our nation’s history.</p>
