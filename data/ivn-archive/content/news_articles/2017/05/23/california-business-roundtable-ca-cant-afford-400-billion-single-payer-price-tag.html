<p>The California Business Roundtable&nbsp;responded to a legislative&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;Monday that said&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 562</a>, a single-payer health care bill by Sens. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), will cost California $400 billion annually to implement. CBRT President Rob Lapsley says "there is no responsible way to pay for this proposal."</p>

<p>"Let’s look at the facts: California’s 2017-18 budget is estimated at $180 billion. We are the highest tax state in the nation, we are growing lower-wage and higher-wage jobs while losing middle-class jobs, unemployment is below 5 percent yet we are already projecting a budget deficit in the short term. We have billions in unfunded pension and health care liabilities, a worst-in-the-nation poverty rate, long-term debt and a growing housing crisis. But now the Legislature wants to consider a 200 percent increase in the state budget. There is no responsible way to pay for this proposal," states Lapsley.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-first-fiscal-analysis-of-single-payer-1495475434-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the LA Times</a>, the analysis found 3 key takeaways&nbsp;from the proposal:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>SB 562 will cost $400 billion per year to cover all healthcare and administrative costs.</li>
 	<li>Half of that annual cost could be covered by existing federal, state, and local funds&nbsp;repurposed to go toward the single-payer system.</li>
 	<li>New taxes would be needed to raise the additional $200 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>LA Times further reports:</p>
<blockquote>The analysis proposes one scenario&nbsp;in which a new payroll tax on employers — with a rate of 15% of earned income — could supply the new revenue. But the measure itself does not contain a specific tax proposal, and therefore would not, at this point, need a two-thirds vote to approve a new tax.

The write-up also notes that a universal healthcare proposal would likely reduce spending by employers and employees statewide, which currently ranges between $100 billion and $150 billion annually. Therefore, the total new spending under the bill would be between $50 billion and $100 billion each year.</blockquote>
<p>“We are already seeing an exodus of low- and middle-income residents from our state. SB 562 is part of an ongoing progressive agenda that will only result in progressively bankrupting California," Lapsley added in the CBRT press release.</p>
<h3><strong>What do you think of the single-payer proposal in California? Do you think it is a step in the right direction or the wrong path for&nbsp;the state?</strong></h3>
