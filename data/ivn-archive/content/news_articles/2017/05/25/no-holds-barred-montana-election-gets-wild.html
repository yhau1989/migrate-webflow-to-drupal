<p>It is not often a congressional election features a reporter allegedly getting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/greg-gianforte-montana-republican-body-slams-reporter.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">body slammed by one candidate</a>&nbsp;and another who’s been a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/04/27/montana-democrat-rob-quist-performed-at-a-nudist-resort/100950964/" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular at a nudist colony</a>. These, however, are the choices voters have after the secretary of state put&nbsp;up major&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2017/03/29/montana-blocks-out-competition-for-states-only-congressional-seat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadblocks for independent and Green Party candidates</a>.</p>

<p>Yep, Big Sky country is the backdrop for a unique and drama-filled race. Voters will go to the polls Thursday to fill&nbsp;Republican <strong>Ryan Zinke</strong>'s empty congressional seat. Zinke left the US House to head the Department of the Interior.</p>
<h3><strong>The Major Party Candidates</strong></h3>
<p>The Democratic nominee is 69-year-old <strong>Rob Quist</strong>, a bluegrass musician -- who frequently performs at a nudist resort -- and political newcomer. Millions of dollars have poured into the race to support Quist. He also has the support of&nbsp;party activists, and received the endorsement of independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>However, the national party largely withheld its support while the GOP and its allies strafed Quist with a barrage of negative ads that badly damaged his homespun image.</p>

<p>Republican nominee<strong> Greg Gianforte</strong>&nbsp;was cited for misdemeanor assault Wednesday night for allegedly body-slamming Ben Jacobs, a reporter for the Guardian newspaper. It is not likely to be a game-changer for Quist, however, because of the absentee vote.</p>

<p>More than 259,500 ballots were returned by Wednesday evening, according to&nbsp;Derek J. Oestreicher, the Director of Elections and Voter Services. That&nbsp;is about 73% of the total&nbsp;absentee ballots sent&nbsp;out.</p>
<h3><strong>Limited Choice</strong></h3>
<p>IVN started&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2017/03/29/montana-blocks-out-competition-for-states-only-congressional-seat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">following the ballot access case</a>&nbsp;brought against Montana&nbsp;Secretary of State <strong>Cory Stapleton</strong> in late March.</p>

<p>Federal Judge Brian Morris <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/04/12/ballot-access-victory-not-enough-to-open-up-montana-special-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled against the&nbsp;secretary of state</a> on April 8, finding&nbsp;that the signature requirements placed on non-major party candidates severely burdened "the constitutional rights of ballot access for independent candidates and minor party candidates.”</p>

<p>Green Party candidate <strong>Thomas Breck</strong> and independent candidates <strong>Steve Kelly</strong> and <strong>Doug Campbell</strong>&nbsp;were denied access to the special election ballot because they failed to collect at least 14,268 valid signatures between March 1 and March 6. You read that correct -- over 14,000 signatures in 5 days!</p>

<p>Morris did not order the secretary of state to add any additional candidates to the ballot, despite his ruling. Montana voters have three options -- Quist, Gianforte, and Libertarian Mark Wicks, for the state’s only congressional seat.</p>
