<p>Ballot Access News <a href="http://ballot-access.org/2017/05/24/oregon-house-passes-national-popular-vote-plan-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Wednesday</a> that the Oregon State House passed a&nbsp;bill that would add Oregon to the <a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Popular Vote Compact</a> (NPVC). The plan is simple: Each state that joins the NPVC commits to giving all of their <a href="/tag/electoral-college" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electoral College</a> votes to the winner of the national popular vote.</p>

<p>Here are some facts you need to know:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The NPVC is law in 10 states, plus the District of Columbia: California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont,&nbsp;and Washington. Total electoral votes: 165 (<strong>See each state's status <a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state-status" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong>)</li>
 	<li>The plan needs enough states to equal 270 electoral votes (a majority) to be enacted. That would ensure a&nbsp;national popular vote victory without abolishing the Electoral College.</li>
 	<li>90.9 percent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvzARzuxvbM" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's&nbsp;campaign stops</a> in 2016 were in 11 states. Two-thirds of those stops were in 4 battleground states with the most electoral votes: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.</li>
 	<li>The winner of the Electoral College has lost the popular vote 5 times in US presidential history: 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.</li>
 	<li>Advocates of any NPV reform say the winner of a presidential election should never lose the popular vote.</li>
 	<li>Advocates of keeping the Electoral College say it is crucial to give smaller states and their constituents a stronger voice in presidential elections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Oregon bill, <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB2927" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB2927</a>, now goes to the State Senate. Ballot Access News reports that the Senate president will not block it, which he reportedly has done in previous legislative sessions.</p>
