<blockquote><em><span>“<strong>I’m not sure there should be any restrictions whatsoever</strong>, because I don’t think it is the court’s business to draw lines.&nbsp;</span>There are many rules right now — that the courts have laid out — that if you want your redistricting map approved you have to meet.” - US Rep. Glenn Grothman</em></blockquote>
<p>That was the response US Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) gave on&nbsp;the Supreme Court's decision to hear the partisan gerrymandering case,&nbsp;<em><a href="/tag/wisconsin-redistricting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gill v. Whitford</a></em>.&nbsp;Grothman made these comments in an interview with&nbsp;Matt Kittle of the MacIver Institute</p>

<p>It is the first case in which a federal court ruled that a state's electoral maps were unconstitutional not on the basis of race or sex or class discrimination, but because&nbsp;they discriminated against voters based on party affiliation.</p>

<p>The lawsuit raised the fundamental question:&nbsp;does drawing districts for purely partisan reasons violate the fundamental right to vote for everyone else?</p>

<p>Grothman defends the districts, saying that state lawmakers&nbsp;followed all the rules set forth by the court when drawing the maps in 2011.</p>

<p>But these rules&nbsp;do not consider the partisan motives that go into drawing electoral maps, including efforts to pack voters outside the party in power into a small handful of districts to&nbsp;reduce the power these voters have in elections.</p>

<p>That&nbsp;is what is being challenged in <em>Gill v. Whitford</em>. But Grothman doesn't see a problem here. In fact, he doesn't think there should be any restrictions on gerrymandering, and the courts should stay out of it.</p>
