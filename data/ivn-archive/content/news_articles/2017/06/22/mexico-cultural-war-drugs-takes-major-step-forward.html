<p><span>Mexico has decriminalized <a href="/tag/marijuana" rel="noopener noreferrer">marijuana</a> for both medicinal and research purposes.</span></p>

<p>About two months ago, Mexican legislators approved the proposal&nbsp;by an overwhelming majority in both chambers. President Enrique Peña Nieto published the law in the “Diario Oficial de la Federación” Thursday, which officially brought the bill into effect.</p>

<p><span>Mexico’s new law decriminalizes the consumption and cultivation of marijuana for both medicinal and research purposes, as well as production&nbsp;and distribution with the same intent. Legislators expect the law will help introduce new therapy and treatments for health issues such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>A Conservative Culture</strong></h3>
<p>To better understand the impact of Mexican legislators legalizing the consumption of medical marijuana, you have to understand Mexican society.</p>

<p>Mexico is in general a conservative, catholic, patriarchal society, which for years and years has resisted addressing some liberal issues like abortion, gay marriage, and drug consumption.</p>

<p><span>Even though the country has had a strict separation of Church and State policy since the times of Benito Juarez, the Church still plays a strong role in education – with some of the biggest private educational institutions being controlled by religious organizations – and as such, it has a major role on social issues.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Mexico's War on Drugs</strong></h3>
<p>Most importantly, Mexico has fought a long, costly, and deadly battle against drugs. Mexico’s role has evolved from being a transit country, where the flow of narcotics moved from South and Central America, to having some of the most powerful drug organizations in the world.</p>

<p><span>While the citizens of Mexico are not a traditional consumer society, the more restrictive border controls implemented at the US-Mexico crossing have&nbsp;caused the Mexican cartels to create a consumer market </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> the country. It's a phenomenon that has boosted this need to legally regulate drug&nbsp;consumption.</span></p>

<p><span>Even though Mexico’s lawmakers took a big step by legalizing the use of medical marijuana, it is highly unlikely they will consider legalizing its use for recreational purposes anytime soon.</span></p>
