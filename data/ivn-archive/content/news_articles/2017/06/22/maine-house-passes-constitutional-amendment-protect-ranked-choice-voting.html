<p>Speaker Sara Gideon released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>“Mainers asked for election reform and it is our responsibility to respect their wishes, while upholding our duty as legislators. Today, the House took the first steps in amending the constitution to allow full implementation of ranked choice voting. While this process is ongoing and we still have many votes to take, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and send it to voters for approval. “ - Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon</em></blockquote>
<p>The constitutional amendment now needs final approval from two-thirds of&nbsp;the Legislature, and if it gets that&nbsp;it will be sent to voters for approval.</p>

<p>It appears, though, that voters had a huge impact on this development&nbsp;for Maine ranked choice voting.</p>
