<p>There was a huge update with <a href="/tag/rcv-maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine ranked choice voting</a> Wednesday.</p>

<p>The State Senate <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/06/21/maine-senate-rejects-repeal-of-ranked-choice-voting-law-on-split-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tabled the bill that called for full repeal</a> of the voter-approved initiative, and voted unanimously (without a roll call tally) to send a constitutional amendment to the State House that would bring the ranked choice voting statute into compliance with a state constitutional provision&nbsp;that affects three state elections.</p>

<p>This is the result of <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/15/maine-lawmakers-decide-fate-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands of Mainers</a> calling, emailing, and talking to their state representatives and senators&nbsp;to protect the will of the people and reject full repeal of ranked choice voting.</p>

<p>It is the result of all the Maine voters who <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/02/mainers-come-droves-support-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">packed hearing rooms</a> to voice their support for ranked choice voting -- even bringing around a&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/20/major-opponent-maine-ranked-choice-voting-tells-lawmakers-reject-full-repeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-sponsor of the full repeal bill</a>.</p>
