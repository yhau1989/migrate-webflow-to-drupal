<p>Dozens and dozens of <a href="/tag/maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine</a> ​citizens ​from across the state filled the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee room Friday&nbsp;​to testify in support of LD 1624, "Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Implement Ranked-choice Voting," and in opposition to LD 1625, "An Act To Repeal the Ranked-choice Voting Law​.​"​</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Not a single Maine citizen showed up ​Friday ​to testify against ranked choice voting." hyperlink="https://ivn.us/2017/06/02/mainers-come-droves-support-ranked-choice-voting/" handle="rcvmaine" hashes=""]

<p>In fact, they had to open an overflow room to accommodate all of the Maine citizens who were there to testify in support of defending Maine's <a href="/tag/rcv-maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranked Choice Voting</a> law. Perhaps most noteworthy: Not a single Maine citizen showed up ​Friday ​to testify against LD 1624 or in favor of LD 1625.​</p>

<p>Only a few legislators testified for full repeal, and more legislators showed up to testify in favor of the constitutional amendment.</p>

<p>​Also, another breaking development: Senator Mike Carpenter, who signed on as a co-sponsor of LD 1625 last Thursday, went to the mic Friday&nbsp;and walked back his support for full repeal at the beginning of the hearing.</p>

<p>Instead, he expressed his preference for finding a common sense solution that upholds the will of the people and brings the existing statute as approved by Maine voters&nbsp;into constitutional compliance.</p>

<p>There are, <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/29/maine-lawmakers-about-give-voters-the-shaft/" rel="noopener noreferrer">as previously covered</a>, no constitutional questions about using Ranked Choice Voting in primary elections or in federal elections -- 7 out of 10 elections as approved by Maine voters.</p>
