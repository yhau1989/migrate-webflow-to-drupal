<p>U.S. Sen. <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a> (I-Vt.) has stakes in Tuesday's Virginia primary election. He has involved himself in a number of races in 2017, but the governor's race in Virginia is arguably&nbsp;the biggest.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Perriello" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Perriello</a></strong> is a former one-term U.S. representative, and served as president and CEO of the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for American Progress Action Fund</a>&nbsp;(CAP). According to CAP, the group is "dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans, through bold, progressive ideas, as well as strong leadership and concerted action."</p>

<p>Perriello's campaign has&nbsp;tried to tap into the same populist and anti-establishment appeal that drove millions to the polls in the 2016 presidential primary to vote for Bernie Sanders. And he has Sanders' support.</p>

<p>Perriello's opponent is Lt. Governor Ralph Northam, who has the support of many Democratic officials and was hand-picked by Governor Terry McAuliffe to be his successor.&nbsp;Northam has challenged Perriello's progressive cred on a number of issues, including the Affordable Care Act, abortion, and oil drilling.</p>

<p>May <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/governor/va/virginia_governor_democratic_primary-6189.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">public opinion polls</a> showed Perriello and Northam in a tight race. Perriello hopes the disdain for the political establishment in Virginia and DC will drive voters out to give him the push he needs on election day.</p>

<p>Virginia primary election law says no party affiliation is required to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary. This means voters not registered with the Republican or Democratic Party can vote in&nbsp;Tuesday's election, along with registered party voters.</p>
