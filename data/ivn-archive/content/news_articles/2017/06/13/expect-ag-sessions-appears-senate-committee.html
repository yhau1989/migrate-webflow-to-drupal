<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions is testifying Tuesday morning before the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>

<p>As part of its ongoing probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Sessions will address some lines of inquiry regarding the Russia investigation and his time as attorney general.</p>

<p>Here is what Sessions is expected to emphasize:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Sessions is expected to claim there was no meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel during&nbsp;an April 2016 Trump campaign event.</li>
 	<li>He is expected to tell the committee he did not commit perjury when he denied having had any communications with Russians during the presidential campaign last year.</li>
 	<li>Sessions will also likely speak to the process of filling out his SF-86 security clearance form in 2016 -- specifically, the advice he received from FBI personnel that he didn’t need to include all of the meetings he had with foreign officials as a sitting Senator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what Sessions likely won’t address:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Sessions is not expected to answer questions about specific conversations with President Trump.</li>
 	<li>Sessions will likely claim executive privilege with any Russian collusion questioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sessions'&nbsp;appearance before the Senate intelligence committee comes a week after former FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers the bureau had expected Sessions to recuse himself from the&nbsp;investigation into contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russia,&nbsp;weeks before he formally did so.</p>

<p>Sessions stepped aside from the investigation in early March after acknowledging he had spoken twice with the Russian ambassador to the United States in the months before the election.</p>

<p>He said under oath at his January confirmation hearing that he had not met with Russians during the campaign.</p>
