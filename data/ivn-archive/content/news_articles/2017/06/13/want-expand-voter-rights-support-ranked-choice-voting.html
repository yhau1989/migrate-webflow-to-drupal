<p><strong><a href="http://www.voterchoicema.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voter Choice Massachusetts</a></strong>&nbsp;Executive Director Adam Friedman made one thing clear to Massachusetts Democrats: If you support protecting and enhancing voter rights, you should support <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a>.</p>

<p>"Do you support voting&nbsp;rights and voter empowerment? Do you support inclusion, diversity, and unity for the party and for the United States of America? If you support these things, you should support ranked choice voting," says Friedman.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="(Under ranked choice voting) your vote is never wasted, your vote is always in play." author="Adam Friedman, executive director of Voter Choice MA"]

<p>Friedman gave his remarks on the convention floor of the 2017 Massachusetts Democratic Convention. His goal was to convince the 4,500 delegates present to vote in support of ranked choice voting.</p>

<p>And his speech may have had a huge impact. The Massachusetts Democratic Party voted Saturday to add an amendment to the party's new platform supporting ranked choice voting.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/massachusetts_democrats_back_rcv_at_state_convention" rel="noopener noreferrer">FairVote</a>, 3 bills were introduced in the&nbsp;Massachusetts General Court in 2017.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/SD485" rel="noopener noreferrer">SD 485&nbsp;</a>would allow cities and towns to incorporate ranked choice voting, while&nbsp;<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H2897/Cosponsor" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 2897&nbsp;</a>would do the same for certain municipalities," reports FairVote. "The latter already has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fairvote.org/in_writing_their_platforms_parties_strive_for_a_more_open_electoral_system" rel="noopener noreferrer">thirty-one cosponsors</a>. In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H377" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 377</a>&nbsp;would enable ranked choice voting for all statewide offices."</p>

<p>According to FairVote, "ranked choice voting is used to elect city officers in 11 cities today, with two cities awaiting implementation as soon as voting equipment is ready."</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="/tag/rcv-maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine</a> voters <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/09/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-celebrate-historic-victory-in-maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved the implementation of ranked choice voting</a> in November 2016 for all statewide and congressional races.</p>

<p>Maine&nbsp;lawmakers, however, may soon go against the will of their voters after the state Supreme Court <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/23/breaking-maine-supreme-court-says-ranked-choice-voting-unconstitutional/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a non-binding opinion</a> that ranked choice voting was&nbsp;in conflict with a state constitutional provision&nbsp;that deals with 3 state general elections.</p>

<p>Yet the Maine&nbsp;Supreme Court did not find a constitutional conflict with primary and federal&nbsp;elections -- most elections under ranked choice voting.</p>
