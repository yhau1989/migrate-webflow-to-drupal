<p>Petty politics aside, let's look at some&nbsp;pretty phenomenal&nbsp;facts. Donald Trump is the very first President of the United States of America to embrace gay marriage BEFORE winning the election. Period.</p>

<p>“I’m fine with same-sex marriage,” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/11/14/trump-scotus-60-minutes-cbs-sot-ath.cnn" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump said</a> in the midst of a REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY!</p>

<p>So, as a voter who sees the Republican Party’s traditional reproach of gay marriage as self-defeating and the Democratic Party’s traditional support of gay marriage as pandering for votes, I wonder when gay pride became so obsessed with politics that hate for the President became more important than the pursuit of equality.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Trump is the&nbsp;first POTUS&nbsp;to embrace gay marriage BEFORE winning the election." hyperlink="https://ivn.us/2017/06/09/back-closet-pride-parade-rejects-gays-trump/" handle="" hashes=""] It is worth noting that&nbsp;the president has been criticized this month for not yet&nbsp;recognizing June 2017 as Pride Month in commemoration of&nbsp;the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the birth of the modern LGBT movement.

<p>Here’s another relevant fact though: the organizers of Charlotte’s gay pride parade will not allow a “Gays for Trump” float in&nbsp;their parade.</p>

<p>Fact: Hillary Clinton didn’t support gay marriage until 2013. She spent decades opposing it.</p>

<p>Fact: in 2008, Barack Obama went on record saying, "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage."</p>

<p>These are the two most recent champions of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>In a statement, Charlotte Pride’s board said:</p>
<blockquote>"In the past, we have made similar decisions to decline participation from other organizations espousing anti-LGBTQ religious or public policy stances. Charlotte Pride envisions a world in which LGBTQ people are affirmed, respected, and included in the full social and civic life of their local communities, free from fear of any discrimination, rejection, and prejudice."</blockquote>
<p>Previous parade participants have supported former President Barack Obama and Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>This year, “Gays for Trump” is not allowed.</p>

<p>So if you want to be gay and support the president, put your MAGA shirt back in the closet.</p>

<p>Those are&nbsp;all the facts you need.</p>
