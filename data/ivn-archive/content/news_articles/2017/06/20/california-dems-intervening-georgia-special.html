<p>The special congressional election in Georgia's 6th District has attracted a lot of outside interest. Democrats, looking for a symbolic victory against President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a>, have spent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trumps-agenda-on-the-line-in-a-hard-fought-georgia-house-race/2017/06/19/26db597a-551e-11e7-b38e-35fd8e0c288f_story.html?utm_term=.2f6a1015a805" rel="noopener noreferrer">record-breaking amounts of money and resources</a> to flip the district blue.</p>

<p>In California, the Democratic Party is even calling on&nbsp;its people to"Get Out The Vote" for Democratic candidate <a href="/tag/jon-ossoff" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Ossoff</a>. Party Chair&nbsp;Eric C. Bauman sent an email to state&nbsp;Democrats Tuesday morning,&nbsp;asking them to volunteer to make calls to voters into Georgia's 6th District.</p>

<p>"Let's make history and send a clear message to Donald Trump and the morally bankrupt Republican Party: The American people won't stand for this divisive, extremist agenda anymore," Bauman writes.</p>

<p>This is how intense and partisan this little House race has become.</p>

<p>For Democrats across the US, it is not about Georgia's 6th District or its voters. It is about turning this race into a symbolic referendum on the president, even when the race has no real consequences: the balance of power in Congress is not at stake and House leadership is not affected.</p>

<p>It is all about Trump, and as a consequence Georgia voters are getting left out of the conversation completely.</p>
