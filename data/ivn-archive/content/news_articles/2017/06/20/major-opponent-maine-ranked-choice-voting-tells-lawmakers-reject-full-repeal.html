<p>Maine State Senator <strong>Michael Carpenter</strong> <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2017/06/20/opinion/contributors/i-voted-against-ranked-choice-voting-but-i-dont-support-repealing-the-law/?ref=regionstate" rel="noopener noreferrer">pinned an op-ed </a>for the Bangor Daily News Tuesday that calls on lawmakers not to repeal the voter-approved <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a>&nbsp;statute, but instead find compromise.</p>

<p>Carpenter, a former state attorney general, initially co-sponsored&nbsp;the bill that calls for full repeal, but after listening to voters in public hearings and "reviewing the facts," he had a change of heart.</p>

<p>"Lawmakers should not overrule the more than 388,000 Maine people from across the political spectrum who voted last November to enact ranked-choice voting, the second largest referendum vote in our state's history," Carpenter writes.</p>

<p>He added, "As I heard from some of the voters in public testimony, I realized they were rightfully astonished and offended by the prospect of full repeal. There is an opportunity for middle ground."</p>

<p>The middle ground? Move forward with ranked choice voting in federal and primary elections (70% of elections under ranked choice voting), where there is no state constitutional conflict. Then amend the constitution for the three state elections the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/05/23/breaking-maine-supreme-court-says-ranked-choice-voting-unconstitutional/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine Supreme Court</a> says ranked choice voting does not comply with the state constitution.</p>

<p>"I did not support Question 5 (RCV initiative), and I do not like ranked-choice voting as a policy today. But like U.S. Sen. Angus King, who <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/07/sen-king-voters-decide-fate-maine-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed his concern about a full repeal of the law</a> in an interview with Maine Public last week, I do not wish to instigate any further distrust in the political process or in government as a whole," says Carpenter.</p>
