<p>T.J. O’Hara, IVN’s podcast host, is joined by <a href="/tag/tim-canova" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tim Canova</strong></a>. Last year Tim Canova ran against then-DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, in South Florida’s 23rd Congressional District.</p>



<p>The two discuss how he was inspired to run and the race against Wasserman Schultz. They look at the <a href="/tag/dnc-lawsuit" rel="noopener noreferrer">class action lawsuit</a> filed in Florida against Wasserman Schultz, and the numerous faux pas she’s made that have alienated a myriad of voters.</p>

<p>Tim Canova announced on the evening of Thursday, June 15, that he intends to run against Wasserman Schultz, once again in the upcoming congressional race in 2018.</p>

<p>Born and raised on Long Island in Merrick, New York, Canova&nbsp;moved to Florida in the mid-1990s for the first time. Tim completed his undergraduate studies in government and economics at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Pennsylvania, earned a law degree, with honors, at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., and was a Swedish Institute Visiting Scholar at the University of Stockholm.</p>

<p>Tim became an associate attorney at a prominent law firm and then a visiting professor at the University of Miami. He taught at the University of New Mexico School of Law, and Chapman University in Southern California. He moved back to South Florida in 2012 for a teaching position at the Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law, where he is a professor of law and public finance.</p>

<p>In 2011, Tim took part in the Occupy Wall Street movement, teaching a workshop on the Federal Reserve at the Occupy Los Angeles encampment. At that time, he was also selected by U.S. Senator <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a> to serve on an advisory committee on Federal Reserve reform.</p>

<p>Tim lives in Hollywood (Broward County, FL), and in his spare time he enjoys cooking, movies, Pilates and yoga, as well as running and bicycling on the Hollywood Beach Broadwalk.</p>
