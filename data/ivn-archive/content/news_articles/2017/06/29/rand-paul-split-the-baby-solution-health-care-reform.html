<p>U.S. Senator&nbsp;<a href="/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a>&nbsp;(R-Ky.) appeared on MSNBC's <em>Morning Joe</em> Thursday to discuss his solution to not only moving forward on health care reform, but bringing Republicans and Democrats to the table.</p>

<p>His solution: Essentially, split the baby.</p>

<p>Paul&nbsp;wants to divide the bill into two bills. One bill gives conservatives the Obamacare repeal. The other he&nbsp;says gives Democrats the spending they want.</p>

<p>"You can repeal the taxes, you can repeal some of the regulations -- I'd prefer all of them -- and you can also do some Medicaid reform," says Paul. "But then to the people who want billions of dollars in new spending, the people who want to retain a lot of the Obamacare spending, that can be put in another bill."</p>

<p>He mentions the SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) as an example of a bill that some of the funding could go into.</p>
