<p>Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson discussed the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/28/no-difference-between-journalists-and-political-operatives-anymore/" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest bombshell developments at&nbsp;CNN</a>&nbsp;and the state of corporate media with Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson Tuesday night. She said, among other things, that Americans are getting "an artificial reality put out by people with narratives."</p>

<p>This&nbsp;includes Democrats, Republicans, and corporate interests.</p>

<p>Attkisson says:</p>
<p><em>"People sense -- at least some people -- that they are not getting an accurate picture, and I think if you are like me there is very little that I see reported in the news that I instantly believe without doing my own checking, because so many formerly reputable news organizations have been proven to be 180 degrees wrong."</em></p>
<p>She says&nbsp;the establishment, both political and in the media, have&nbsp;thrown out the rule book in response to President <a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;and the threat he poses to them. She adds that&nbsp;they&nbsp;now exercise without impunity&nbsp;practices and standards that journalists would not be allowed to do in journalism school.</p>

<p>"Sometimes there is little meaningful difference now, I think, between the people who are reporting the news and the political operatives who want to advance news narrative," says&nbsp;Attkisson.</p>

<p>Attkisson has a new book out called, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smear-Shady-Political-Operatives-Control/dp/0062468162/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498674316&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+smear" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives Control What You See, How You Think, and How You Vote</em></a>. She compares the current state of corporate media to state-run media in North Korea, among other things.</p>

<p>Her book&nbsp;released nationwide Wednesday.</p>
