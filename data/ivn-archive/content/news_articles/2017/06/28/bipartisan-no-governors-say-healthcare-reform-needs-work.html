<p>The efforts by a group of Senate Republicans to craft the repeal of Obamacare has come up woefully short, and it not acceptable. So say a group of bipartisan governors.</p>
<p>Spearheading the <strong>No on Healthcare Reform</strong> efforts are a pair of moderates: Ohio Gov. <a href="/tag/john-kasich" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>John Kasich</strong></a>&nbsp;and Colorado Gov. <a href="/tag/john-hickenlooper" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>John Hickenlooper</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This week, the pair called on the Senate to reject the Republican bill and to negotiate a bipartisan alternative.</p>
<p>Gov. Kasich denounced his party’s legislation, saying it would victimize the poor and mentally ill, and give tax money “to people who are already very wealthy.” Kasich noted,&nbsp;“This bill is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The mounting criticism meant a vote on the bill would be stalled until after the July 4 holiday. It also reinforced the thought that the bill needed a lot of work to even be considered for passage.</p>
