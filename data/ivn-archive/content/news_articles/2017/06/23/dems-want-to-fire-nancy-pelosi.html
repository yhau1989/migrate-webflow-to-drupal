<p><a href="https://grabien.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Grabien</strong></a> published a video montage Friday of the Democratic lawmakers who are now calling on US House Minority Leader <a href="/tag/nancy-pelosi" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong></a> (D-Calif.) to step down or be replaced. In fact, <a href="https://news.grabien.com/story-dems-increasingly-defiant-calls-growing-louder-pelosis-sacki" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Democrats</a> reportedly met to discuss a "coup" against Pelosi.</p>

<p>These Democrats include Reps. <strong>Filemon Vela</strong> (D-Texas), <strong>Kathleen Rice</strong> (D-N.Y), <strong>Seth Moulton</strong> (D-Mass.), and others. US Rep. <strong>Tim Ryan</strong> (D-Ohio) even said the Democratic brand has become "toxic" under Pelosi's leadership.</p>

<p>The calls from some Democrats for Pelosi to step down follow another special election loss Tuesday, in which Democrat <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/20/republican-handel-takes-georgias-sixth-congressional-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Ossoff lost to Republican Karen Handel</a> in Georgia's 6th Congressional District despite <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/21/money-spent-ga-6-just-lose-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tens of millions of dollars</a> spent -- along with <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/20/california-dems-intervening-georgia-special/" rel="noopener noreferrer">other party resources</a> -- to propel Ossoff to victory.</p>

<p>In a related note, Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that he hopes Democrats don't force Pelosi out:</p>
