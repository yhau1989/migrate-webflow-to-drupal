<p>A constitutional amendment to bring the voter-approved <a href="/tag/rcv-maine" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting initiative</a> in full compliance with the Maine constitution <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maine/articles/2017-06-23/house-votes-spells-doom-for-ranked-choice-voting-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed to get the final two-thirds vote</a> it needed in the Maine House Friday. The vote occurred a day&nbsp;after the House gave initial approval for the amendment.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/15/maine-lawmakers-decide-fate-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thousands of Maine voters</a> called, emailed, tweeted, and spoke to state lawmakers ahead of this week, calling on&nbsp;them to respect their vote and not repeal ranked choice voting. As a result, the Senate <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/22/maine-lawmakers-face-massive-will-people-protect-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tabled a full&nbsp;repeal bill</a> Wednesday and unanimously voted to send the constitutional amendment to the House.</p>

<p>Independent State Rep. <a href="/tag/kent-ackley" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Ackley </a>(I-&nbsp;Monmouth) made the following statement:</p>
<p><em>“When Mainers vote they do so deliberately. They don't just wander into the polling place saying: ‘What's going on?’ They aren't going to vote for something unless the value is clear and certain. Who are we to disregard that time and effort? We've agreed to abide by the results of votes. Votes count. Like 'em or not." - State Rep. Kent Ackley</em></p>
<p>"It makes no sense for duly elected officials to say voters didn't understand questions on the ballot that elected them. What we cannot do is turn our backs on a legal and binding decision made in a sacred place,” he adds.</p>

<p>Not only have Maine citizens reached out, but the state's <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/08/press-herald-maine-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest newspapers</a>,&nbsp;and U.S. Sen. <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/07/sen-king-voters-decide-fate-maine-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus King</a> have called on lawmakers to honor the will of voters and protect Maine ranked choice voting. Even a co-sponsor of the repeal bill had a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/20/major-opponent-maine-ranked-choice-voting-tells-lawmakers-reject-full-repeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">change of heart</a> after listening to what voters had to say.</p>

<p>Sen. Cathy Breen, who championed the proposed amendment, called&nbsp;the House vote Friday "a setback" to implementing ranked choice voting in Maine.</p>
