<p>Perhaps this is not a surprise to most, but the majority of Americans are over the Russia investigations.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="http://harvardharrispoll.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard-Harris poll</a>, shows the majority of voters (64%) believe the investigations are hurting the country. And get this, most voters (56%) want Congress and the media to move on to other issues.</p>

<p>According to the poll, Americans are clearly more concerned with healthcare, terrorism, the economy, and jobs.</p>

<p>There is, however, strong support for the independent special counsel investigation of Russia and President Trump. A Harvard-Harris poll released last month found 75 percent support former FBI Robert Mueller’s investigation.</p>

<p>Even so, most voters (73%) are worried the Russia probes have caused the nation’s lawmakers to lose focus on the many issues facing Americans today.</p>

<p>The poll shows strength and consistency along party lines: 81 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of independents, and 68 percent of Democrats agree that it's time to move on from Russia.</p>
