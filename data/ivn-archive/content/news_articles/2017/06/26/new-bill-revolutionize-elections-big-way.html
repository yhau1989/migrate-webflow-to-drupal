<p>US Rep. <strong>Don Beyer</strong> (D-Va.) introduced a bill that calls for&nbsp;radical changes to the way congressional elections are conducted.</p>

<p>It is called the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/15/fair-representation-act-best-solution-end-partisan-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fair Representation Act</strong></a>, and it would revolutionize not only the way members of the House are elected, but also how congressional districts are drawn.</p>

<p>"Our country is divided along class, political, and ideological lines like never before, and frustration with our current brand of politics is at a tipping point," Beyer says.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Less than 20 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its job. A big reason for this is the incredible polarization, the hollowing out of the political center that has taken hold of Congress over the last two decades." - US Rep. Don Beyer</em></blockquote>
<p>Beyer says the Fair Representation Act, which he introduced with Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FairVote</a>'s Rob Richie and Krist Novoselic, and Lanae Erickson Hatalsky&nbsp;of <a href="http://www.thirdway.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third Way</a>, can create a healthier political environment for legislating, give voters more choice, and make every election meaningful to every voter.</p>

<p>The Fair Representation Act would:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Implement <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a> for primary and general elections;</li>
 	<li>Reform electoral districting&nbsp;by using&nbsp;multi-member districts in states with more than one seat;</li>
 	<li>Use&nbsp;independent redistricting commissions to draw these districts; and</li>
 	<li>Eliminate winner-take-all in congressional elections to ensure all voters get fair representation.</li>
</ol>
