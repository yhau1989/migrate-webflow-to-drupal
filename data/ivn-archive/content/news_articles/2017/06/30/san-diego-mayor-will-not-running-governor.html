<p><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong>- The State of California's Republican Party hoped San Diego&nbsp;Mayor Kevin Faulconer would announce his plan to run for the top political post in the state.</p>

<p>It appears their wish will not become reality.</p>

<p>In a deep blue state, Faulconer was considered the top GOP contender. The race will likely now be highlighted by Democratic candidates. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom leads a deep Democratic bench.</p>

<p>In a statement released on his Facebook Page, Faulconer wrote:</p>



<p>It has been a crazy&nbsp;24 hours for "America's Finest City."</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4y1Xm0uqv0OaU9oaGNHanR5U1E" rel="noopener noreferrer">memo released Thursday</a>, the city attorney of San Diego, Mara Elliott, called for the immediate resignation of the city employee(s) responsible for leaking a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4y1Xm0uqv0OaHMzamt2Q3JYMjA" rel="noopener noreferrer">classified document</a> related to a controversial development&nbsp;project, known as SoccerCity.</p>

<p>The proposed project, spearheaded by Faulconer, has had a bumpy road in its bid to replace the Qualcomm Stadium location, where the San Diego Chargers used to play.</p>
