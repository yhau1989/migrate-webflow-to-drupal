<p>A bill that creates tougher policies for illegal re-entry into the US passed the&nbsp;House Thursday. It's called Kate's Law, and it nearly got unanimous approval&nbsp;from Republicans. Nearly. There was one Republican who voted against it.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="/tag/justin-amash" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin Amash</strong></a>.</p>

<p>US Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) is a hardline libertarian Republican. He has built a reputation of voting against government intervention of all types and has never been afraid to buck the GOP establishment or vote against the&nbsp;party's interests.</p>

<p>Some even say he is the next "Dr. No," the nickname Dr. <a href="/tag/ron-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Paul</a> was given during his tenure in the House for his uncompromising stance on the role of government and the number of "no" votes he cast while in office.</p>

<p>Amash is usually&nbsp;transparent about his votes in the House. He will post a statement on Facebook or Twitter following each floor vote explaining why he voted the way he did.</p>

<p>Amash voted against Kate's Law (HR 3004) and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3003/text" rel="noopener noreferrer">HR 3003</a>). HR 3003 cuts federal grant funding for "sanctuary cities," jurisdictions that limit their cooperation in&nbsp;the enforcement of federal immigration laws.&nbsp;More Republicans voted against this bill, totaling 7, including Amash.</p>

<p>Rep. Amash&nbsp;offered the following explanation on Facebook for his vote on HR 3003:</p>



<p><strong>What do you think? Is Amash right or wrong about Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act?</strong></p>
