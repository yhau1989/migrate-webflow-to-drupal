<p><a href="http://projectveritas.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Veritas</a> released part one of its "American Pravada" series late Monday. The video allegedly shows&nbsp;a <a href="/tag/cnn" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> supervising producer saying the network's nonstop Russia coverage was about ratings and that it was "mostly bulls*** right now."</p>

<p>"I think the president is probably right to say, like, you are witch-hunting me. You have no smoking gun. You have no real proof," says CNN Supervising Producer John Bonifield out of Atlanta.</p>

<p>According to Bonified, President Trump has been good for business, plain and simple.</p>

<p>"All the nice cutesy little ethics that used to get talked about in journalism school, you're just like, that's adorable. That's adorable. This is a business," he says in one clip.</p>

<p>The goal of "American Pravada," according to Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe, "is to expose the real motivations behind the decision making process at our dominant media corporations." Part I is focused entirely on CNN.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think? Is Project Veritas on to something?</strong></p>
