<p>The Maine House passed an amended version of the full repeal bill Tuesday that would implement <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a> for U.S. House&nbsp;and primary elections, where there is no state constitutional conflict. The bill would allow the legislature to address the need for a constitutional amendment for three state general elections at a later date.</p>

<p>The House vote followed shortly after the Maine Senate <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/27/maine-senate-votes-repeal-will-people/" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed full repeal</a>&nbsp;which would kill the voter-approved initiative. The House&nbsp;is doing exactly what <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/15/maine-lawmakers-decide-fate-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands of Mainers</a>&nbsp;contacted their legislators to do.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;bill -- which&nbsp;would implement ranked choice voice voting in a majority of elections -- is supported by an <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/20/major-opponent-maine-ranked-choice-voting-tells-lawmakers-reject-full-repeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial co-sponsor of the full repeal bill</a>, the state's <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/08/press-herald-maine-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest newspapers</a>, U.S. Sen. <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/07/sen-king-voters-decide-fate-maine-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus King</a>&nbsp;(I-Maine), and the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/02/mainers-come-droves-support-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voters who came out in droves</a>&nbsp;to protect ranked choice voting.</p>

<p>The fate of ranked choice voting is still up in the air as the Senate and the House have two conflicting paths forward. Legislators may need to form a special committee to negotiate the legislature's final actions on Maine ranked choice voting before the session ends.</p>
