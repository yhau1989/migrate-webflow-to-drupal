<p>The Maine Senate <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/06/27/maine-senate-votes-to-repeal-states-new-ranked-choice-voting-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted Tuesday</a> to repeal the first-in-the-nation, voter-approved <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a> initiative for state and federal elections. The mostly&nbsp;party-line vote (the Republican majority, plus some Democrats) approved full repeal, 21-13.</p>

<p>The Maine House did not approve a constitutional amendment on a final vote Friday that would bring ranked choice voting in full compliance with the state constitution, despite a huge amount of support for it.</p>
