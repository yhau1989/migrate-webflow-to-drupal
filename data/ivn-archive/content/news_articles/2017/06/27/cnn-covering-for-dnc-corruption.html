<p>We should have known this hysteria would come after election night.</p>

<p>All one needs to do is look at the District of Columbia voting results to understand that President's Trump's campaign promise to <strong>Drain The Swamp</strong> would rouse every sordid creature from the depths of D.C..</p>

[heading title="The Russia Hysteria" subtitle=""]

<p>The backbone of the Russian hysteria story has been built exclusively on two sources, both of which have been debunked and characterized as false.</p>

<p>The substance of this hysteria has been parroted by the mainstream media (MSM), lawmakers, and the Intelligence community. The goal all along by these groups has been twofold:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Deflect any tie to the DNC and their involvement in the leaks that harmed the Clinton candidacy and forced the removal of the chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</li>
 	<li>And delegitimize the Trump presidency.</li>
</ul>
[heading title="Russia Source No. 1: Fusion GPS" subtitle=""]

<p>The now debunked Russian dossier was brought forward by the consulting firm, Fusion GPS.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The backbone of the Russian hysteria story has been built exclusively on 2 debunked sources." hyperlink="https://ivn.us/2017/06/27/cnn-covering-for-dnc-corruption/" handle="" hashes=""]

<p>Fusion GPS is a D.C. group with deep ties to Hillary Clinton and the DNC. The group is now stonewalling congressional queries into their practices.</p>

<p>The New York Post <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/06/24/inside-the-shadowy-intelligence-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote a recent piece</a> detailing those connections and why the dossier is nothing more than a piece of science fiction designed to damage the president.</p>

[heading title="Russia Source No. 2: CrowdStrike" subtitle=""]

<p>Another Democratic operative is the CrowdStrike crew.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike was the group who gained exclusive access to the DNC servers after the hack, then claimed <a href="https://docs.voanews.eu/en-US/2017/03/23/13e4fe03-a7a7-47ab-b88a-9eb9a2449d19.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia was to blame</a>. Typically, if a foreign power gains access to sensitive information, like the <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">damaging DNC emails</a>, it's a felony.</p>

<p>In the June 21 House Intelligence Committee hearing, Rep. Trey Gowdy noted, "The DNC was the victim of a crime. I’m trying to understand why the victim of a crime would not turn over evidence to [the DHS]&nbsp;and [then-FBI Director] Jim Comey.”</p>

<p>To Gowdy's point. Not only was the information not turned over, the DHS chief testified that the Department of Homeland Security and FBI were not even allowed access to the servers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/crowdstrike-comey-russia-hack-dnc-clinton-trump/3776067.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Think Tanks</a> from around the globe have debunked CrowdStrike's conclusion that Russian operatives hacked the DNC.</p>

[heading title="Jeh Johnson's Testimony" subtitle=""]

<p>The "Russian House of Cards" conspiracy took a big hit on June 21.</p>

<p>The testimony by former DHS chief Jeh Johnson was a game-changer.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The DNC was the victim of a crime. I’m trying to understand why the victim of a crime would not turn over evidence to (the DHS) and (then-FBI Director) Jim Comey." author="US Rep. Trey Gowdy"]

<p>For the first time under oath, an Obama official placed the glaring hacking spotlight not on Russia, but on the DNC.</p>

<p>When questioned about not being allowed access to the DNC servers, Johnson replied, “I recall very clearly that I was not pleased that we were not in there helping them patch this vulnerability.”</p>

<p>If in fact a crime was committed by Russia, and if in fact it was democracy shuttering, and if in fact it was designed to destroy Hillary Clinton's candidacy, why didn't President Obama respond?</p>

<p>Instead, according to the Washington Post piece, Obama sat on this information for months because he didn't want to "influence the outcome of the election."</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>The reaction to Johnson's testimony was extraordinary and expectedly over the top:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Within an hour of Johnson's testimony, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIPyz-vcJqg&amp;t=6s" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debbie Wasserman Schultz was on CNN</a> calling him a liar</li>
 	<li>Two days later,&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/339146-poll-voters-grow-weary-of-russia-probes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard published a poll </a>noting the public was tiring of the subject of Russia meddling</li>
 	<li>Two days later,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/russia-hacking-timeline/?utm_term=.896197b2e7f9" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post wrote a long essay</a> hailing Obama as a courageous man who was torn as to what to do about the Russian hack. Indeed calling it, "the political crime of the Century."</li>
</ul>
[heading title="'Cutesy Little Ethics'" subtitle=""]

<p>“All the nice cutesy little ethics that used to get talked about in journalism school, you’re just like, that’s adorable. That’s adorable. This is a business,” said CNN Supervising Producer John Bonifield.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdP8TiKY8dE" rel="noopener noreferrer">As noted by the incredible undercover video with a CNN producer</a>, what we're ingesting isn't news, it's mock outrage. It is orchestrated by the Washington one&nbsp;percent, and carried out and colluded by anchors, reporters, and lawmakers working hard to keep the D.C. power structure in place.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="All the nice cutesy little ethics that used to get talked about in journalism school, you’re just like, that’s adorable...This is business." author="CNN Supervising Producer John Bonifield"]

<p>A Media Research Center <a href="http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2017/06/27/study-tv-news-obsessed-trump-russia-probe" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> of every evening newscast since the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller on May 17 found<strong> 353 minutes</strong> of airtime devoted to the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia</a> probe.</p>

<p>That's <strong>55 percent</strong> of all coverage of the Trump presidency during those weeks dedicated to a</p>
<p>"mostly bulls*** story."</p>

<p>Forget tax reform, health care, Syria, jobs and infrastructure.</p>

<p>No, let's focus on delegitimizing the president because he isn't "our guy."</p>

[heading title="What's Next" subtitle=""]

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/06/23/debbie-wasserman-schultz-latest-scandal-case-impeachment/" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece written by IVN</a>, we should be watching what happens with the Wasserman Schultz investigation.</p>

<p>We should be paying close attention to the investigation into former Attorney General&nbsp;Loretta Lynch.</p>

<p>And perhaps, if the Senate Intelligence Committee has real stones, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/27/obama-russia-investigation-newt-gingrich-239997" rel="noopener noreferrer">as noted by the former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich</a>, Congress should subpoena Barack Obama.</p>
