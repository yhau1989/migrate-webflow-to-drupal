<p>The California Senate passed legislation earlier this month to implement a single-payer health care system. The bill's passage was warmly received by progressives, but others have raised concerns about funding.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="If we cut every single program and expense from the state budget and redirected it to this bill, we wouldn’t even cover half of the price tag." author="State Senator Tom Berryhill"]

<p>Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon last week issued a <a href="https://speaker.asmdc.org/press-releases/speaker-rendon-statement-health-care" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> saying he would not advance the bill and that it would remain in committee "until further notice." Rendon cited "financing" as a reason he would not pursue the bill.</p>

<p>Despite wide support among Californians, the bill has been heavily criticized as many say it cannot be financed. State Senator Tom Berryhill <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-single-payer-healthcare-plan-advances-1496361965-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently said</a>, "If we cut every single program and expense from the state budget and redirected it to this bill, we wouldn’t even cover half of the price tag."</p>

<p>A recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-first-fiscal-analysis-of-single-payer-1495475434-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis</a> of the bill gave it an estimated cost of $400 billion, which includes an additional $200 billion on top of current spending levels. However, a more recent study conducted by the <a href="https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/996-economic-analysis-of-the-healthy-california-single-payer-health-care-proposal-sb-562" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Massachusetts–Amherst</a> shows that a single-payer system in California is actually quite affordable.</p>

<p>One of the researchers behind the study, Tom Pollin, recently wrote in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-pollin-single-payer-healthcare-healthy-california-20170621-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Enacting a single-payer system would yield considerable savings overall by lowering administrative costs, controlling the prices of pharmaceuticals and fees for physicians and hospitals, reducing unnecessary treatments and expanding preventive care." - Tom Pollin</em></p>
<p>The study concludes that the Healthy California Act would actually produce savings of 18% which when factored into the total cost, brings the price of the bill down to $331 billion.</p>

<p>Pollin notes that currently about 70% of California's health care spending is paid through public programs, totaling $225 billion. That leaves about $10 billion in additional funds the state would need to come up with to replace private insurance.</p>

<p>According to the study, these funds can easily be achieved by the combination of two new taxes.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Under a single-payer system most Californians and businesses would&nbsp;save money." hyperlink="https://ivn.us/2017/06/27/despite-what-you-heard-single-payer-in-california-is-very-affordable/" handle="" hashes=""]

<p>The first is a 2.3% gross receipts tax. The tax would kick in after the first $2&nbsp;million in revenue and would not apply to small businesses.</p>

<p>The second is a 2.3% increase of the state sales tax, with exemptions on housing, utilities, and food. This would be paired with a 2% income tax credit for low income families currently insured through MediCal to offset the sales tax increase.</p>

<p>Overall the study finds that under a single-payer system, most Californians and businesses would&nbsp;save money. Middle income families would see a decrease in health care spending from between 3.4% and 9.9% of their income to just 0.8%.</p>

<p>Businesses as well would see a drop in costs under a single-payer system. Small firms, middle-sized firms, and large firms would see costs fall by 22%, 6.8%, and 0.5% as a share of payroll, respectively.</p>

<p>The study concludes:</p>
<p><em>"In sum, the establishment of the Healthy California single-payer system will generate financial benefits for both families and businesses at all levels of the California economy."</em></p>
<p>Despite the recent concerns by members of both parties that the HCA would be unaffordable, this recent study from UMass provides a clear and affordable path for California to implement single-payer health care for its residents.</p>
