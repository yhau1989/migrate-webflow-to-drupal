<p>If we want to learn a little bit more about Trump's path to the presidency, we can look to recent history. It's not actually totally unprecedented.</p>



<p>Spain, going through its own very tough economic times, has vaulted the populist-left Podemos to the fore, seemingly out of nowhere. Podemos is a bunch of political outsiders with a Marxist approach to campaigning -- and they adopted this style very deliberately. They have a lot to teach us about what might become the new politics of the 21st century.</p>

<p>In the podcast we're joined by author, campaign adviser, and VisualPolitik director Fonseca Porras, to learn more about Podemos and discuss the parallels with Trump in this particularly exciting episode!</p>
