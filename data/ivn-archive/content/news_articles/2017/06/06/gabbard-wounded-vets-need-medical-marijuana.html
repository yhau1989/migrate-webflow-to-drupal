<p>US Rep. <strong><a href="/tag/tulsi-gabbard" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tulsi Gabbard</a></strong>&nbsp;continues to fight for marijuana decriminalization. She shared an article from the <a href="https://www.legion.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Legion</a> Monday, which makes&nbsp;the case for medical marijuana for wounded vets.</p>

<p>Gabbard says the American Legion is right and&nbsp;her bill, HR 1227, "would help veterans get the treatment they need."<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Medical marijuana is still illegal in the US, though several states (<a href="http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881" rel="noopener noreferrer">29 states and DC</a>) have laws on the books that legalize it&nbsp;within their own jurisdictions. Gabbard wants to change this with her bill, "<strong>Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017</strong>." (HR 1227)</p>

<p>HR 1227 removes&nbsp;marijuana from Schedule I under the&nbsp;Controlled Substances Act. The Schedule I classification not only makes it illegal for recreational and medicinal use, it also places heavy restrictions on&nbsp;researching the medical benefits of cannabis.</p>

<p>For instance, in order to comply with federal restrictions, researchers have to source their samples from one place: The University of Mississippi. This gives the university a monopoly over the cultivation of cannabis for research purposes.</p>

<p>"For nearly 90 years, the federal government has deliberately hindered medical research into therapeutic aspects of cannabis, and veterans struggling with <span>PTSD</span> and <span>TBI</span> today are suffering because of this misguided policy," writes Joe Plenzler,&nbsp;director of media relations for the American Legion national headquarters in Washington, <span>D.C.</span></p>

<p>It is not just veterans, however. Americans who suffer from a variety of medical issues -- from epilepsy to chronic pain to cancer treatment -- could potentially benefit from the decriminalization of cannabis.</p>

<p>HR 1227 was introduced back in February. Gabbard sponsored the bill along with Republican US Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.). There are 10 additional cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.</p>

<p>However, despite the bipartisan support, the bill is currently stalled in the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, where it has been since March 16.</p>
