<p>A new survey by <a href="https://icitizen.com/insights/bernie-for-president-movement-and-third-parties-in-u-s-politics-june-14-16-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer">icitizen</a>&nbsp;points to a clear opening for third-party candidates in future elections.</p>

<p>The online survey found that not only do <strong>7 in 10 respondents not feel represented by the Republican or Democratic Parties</strong>, and that a third party is needed, but <strong>6 in 10 Democratic respondents are considering voting for a third party candidate in 2020</strong>.</p>

<p>That is huge considering only 29 percent of Republican respondents said the same.</p>

<p>The wounds are clearly still fresh in the Democratic Party after the DNC&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tilted the presidential primary in Hillary Clinton's favor</a> over U.S. Sen. <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a>, were unwelcoming to non-traditional Democratic voters (i.e. Sanders progressives, independent and third-party voters, etc.), and now struggle to find a message they can win with.</p>

<p>It seems like many Democratic voters are looking for the lifeboats right now, and that could&nbsp;be good news for third-party candidates.</p>

<p>Here are some other key findings from the survey:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>"68% of Democrats, 82% of Independents and over half (54%) of Republicans believe a “third party is necessary” to represent Americans’ political views."</li>
 	<li>"Fully 69% of Americans reported that they would be interested in the establishment of a new political party to serve as a viable alternative to the two-party system (29% not interested, 2% unsure)."</li>
 	<li>"Democrats (75%) and Independents (81%) are among the most interested in the establishment of a new party."</li>
 	<li>"Over half (53%) of Americans believe that including a third party in Congress, so that no party had a majority, would <i>help</i> <i>lawmaking</i> in the U.S. (21% obstruct lawmaking; 19% does not make a difference; 7% unsure)."</li>
</ul>

<p>“Poll results suggest that an overall majority of Americans, including Democrats and Republicans, are looking for more representation of Americans’ views and are likely to give a third party candidate a chance in 2020,” said&nbsp;Cynthia Villacis, Director of Polling at icitizen.</p>
