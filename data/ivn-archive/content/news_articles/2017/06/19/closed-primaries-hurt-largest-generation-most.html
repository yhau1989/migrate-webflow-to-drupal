<p>You know you’ve made it when you become the subject of a Twitter war.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, DNC establishment figures took to the Twittersphere to duke it out with progressive activists over the Party’s use of closed primaries. The <a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratizeus.com%2F2017%2F06%2F12%2Fjoy-reid-just-went-tirade-bernie-sanders-supporters%2F&amp;e=e466e1c0193df8f8dd4a8fb7c825e512&amp;utm_source=openprimaries&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=6_18_17_hotlist&amp;n=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-day debate</a> was provoked by Young Turks reporter Nomiki Konst, after she tweeted a series of statements in support of open primaries. <a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FNomikiKonst%2Fstatus%2F874298525525454848&amp;e=e466e1c0193df8f8dd4a8fb7c825e512&amp;utm_source=openprimaries&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=6_18_17_hotlist&amp;n=3" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can see part of the exchange here</a>.</p>

<p>Konst is a progressive activist and a member of the DNC’s Unity Reform Commission, a group tasked with offering recommendations to make the Party’s primary process more democratic. Her initial tweets came shortly after she spoke about reforming the Democratic Party at The People’s Summit, an annual conference of progressives held in Chicago.</p>
