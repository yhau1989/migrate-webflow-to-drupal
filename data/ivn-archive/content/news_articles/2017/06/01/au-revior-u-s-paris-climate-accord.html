<p>President <strong><a href="/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> announced the US's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord Thursday, following through on one of his campaign promises.</p>

<p>The agreement, scheduled to being in 2020, was signed by 197 parties (196 countries and 1 economic integration organization), and has been ratified by 147 parties. The goal is to reduce climate emissions around the globe.</p>

<p>The Paris&nbsp;accord and the decision to leave has divided people on the left and the right even more than the issue of climate change already does.</p>

<p>Those in agreement of withdrawing say this <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/06/01/rand-paul-climate-deal-paris-trump-disaster-american-jobs-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer">puts American workers first</a>, and that the U.S. would bear the brunt of the costs of the agreement&nbsp;for the first 10 years.</p>

<p>The president stated, “I don’t work for the people of Paris, I work for the people of the United States.”</p>

<p>Those in opposition of withdrawing say the president is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/paris-agreement-trump-bernie-sanders-response-withdrawal-deal-disgrace-a7768151.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of touch with the rest of the world</a>, and that doubting relevant science has not only damaged our foreign relationships, but also accelerated the devastating impacts of global warming.</p>

<p>Reaction on Twitter has been swift and powerful on&nbsp;both sides. From the Left:</p>

<p>The Paris deal, while not a binding agreement, is the world's first comprehensive climate plan.</p>
