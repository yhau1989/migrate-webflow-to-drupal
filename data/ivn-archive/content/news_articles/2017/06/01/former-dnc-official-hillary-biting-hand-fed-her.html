<p>Former DNC Data Director <strong>Andrew Therriault</strong> is upset at <strong><a href="/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong>. He believes&nbsp;the former Democratic presidential candidate went too far when&nbsp;she&nbsp;said the party's data&nbsp;was "mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong,"&nbsp;calling the DNC&nbsp;out for being partly responsible for her loss.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/clinton-code-conference-dnc-bad-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer">made her comments</a> onstage at Recode's&nbsp;<a href="https://events.recode.net/events/code-conference-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Conference</a>&nbsp;in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. She started her remarks by saying she was "very proud" of her own data team, and then unleashed a scathing criticism on the DNC.</p>

<p>“I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party,” Clinton said. “I mean, it was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, this&nbsp;irked the former data director of the party.&nbsp;Therriault went off on Twitter, using strong expletives to rebuke Clinton and defend his data team. Among other things, he&nbsp;said Clinton and her team completely ignored data&nbsp;on Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, three states that swung&nbsp;the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor.</p>

<p>Therriault later deleted these tweets, but when you are someone like him, once you post something on Twitter, it can never be completely removed.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the DNC <a href="/tag/dnc-lawsuit" rel="noopener noreferrer">is in the middle of a lawsuit</a> brought against it by Bernie Sanders supporters for swinging the primary election in Clinton's favor, despite party rules that require neutrality in primary elections. DNC lawyers and officials have repeatedly said it is the party's right to ignore its own rules and hand-pick the candidates it wants to win if it wants to.</p>

<p>It is interesting that Clinton&nbsp;is now adding the DNC and its data to the list of people or institutions she says are&nbsp;responsible for her loss. In&nbsp;various interviews and appearances since&nbsp;the election, she has repeatedly said that Russia interference, James Comey, "fake news," and even "<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/hillary-clinton-life-after-election.html?mid=nymag_press" rel="noopener noreferrer">crazy third-party people</a>," all played a role in her loss to Donald Trump.</p>
