<p>Our democracy is fundamentally broken by a dangerous new era of fierce partisan divisions. Most voters are locked in congressional districts that are increasingly skewed toward one party.</p>

<p>With no power to affect outcomes, too many votes simply do not matter.</p>

<p>The problem goes beyond <a href="/tag/gerrymandering" rel="noopener noreferrer">gerrymandering</a>, redistricting, and money. The problem is districting itself.</p>

<p>The zero-sum, winner-take-all system in which only one person is elected to represent each district no longer works in this era of hardened partisanship.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fair Representation Act</strong> gives voters of all backgrounds and all political stripes the power to elect House Members who reflect their views and will work constructively with others in Congress.</p>

<p>Under the Fair Representation Act, there will be more choices and several winners elected in each district. Congress will remain the same size, but districts will be larger, each electing 3, 4, or 5 winners.</p>

<p>Voters will be free to <a href="/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">rank their choices</a> without fear of "spoilers." No district will be “red” or “blue.” Every district will fairly reflect the spectrum of voters.</p>

<p>Voters are clamoring for change. The Fair Representation Act is effective, constitutional, and grounded in American traditions. It will ensure that every vote counts and all voices are heard.</p>
