Canadians marched in over a dozen cities from Toronto to Vancouver.&nbsp; Mass actions were held in numerous European state capitals such as London, Rome and Berlin, as well as in cities throughout the Asia-Pacific region, from Sydney, Australia to Tokyo, Japan, Seoul, South Korea and Hong Kong. &nbsp;</p><p>The ongoing Occupy Wall Street protest, which provided the focal point for the global demonstrations, was nearly evicted from its encampment at Liberty Plaza in New York's financial district late last week.&nbsp; The owners of the park had demanded that protesters leave the site by Friday so it could be cleaned.&nbsp; Police officials stated that they would not allow demonstrators to re-occupy the site after they were cleared out.&nbsp; In response, protesters spent days cleaning the site themselves and called on supporters to assemble for a pre-dawn demonstration to prevent the eviction Friday morning.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazingly, thousands of New Yorkers turned out for the action, filling the park to overcapacity by 6am, and spilling out into nearby streets and plazas for much of the morning, forcing the police and the owners of the park to stand down.&nbsp; "This is real people power," said one jubilant protester just after the crowd received the news that the eviction would not take place.&nbsp; "We won this round," he continued.&nbsp;</p><p>The demonstration in Times Square was billed as a victory party by protest organizers.&nbsp;</p>
