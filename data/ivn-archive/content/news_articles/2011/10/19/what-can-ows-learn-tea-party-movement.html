As former Vice President <a href="http://rightwingnews.com/republicans/old-gop-doesnt-get-tea-parties/?comments=show" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Quayle</a> told Neil Cavuto in January 2010: "the challenge of my Party is basically to co-opt the populist  movement, the so-called Tea Party Folks whether they are Republicans or  Democrats."</p><p>Now that the Tea Party movement is firmly entrenched within the GOP's political apparatus, the party establishment has launched a full offensive against what remains of it.&nbsp; None other than Rush Limbaugh denounced the "GOP elite's war on the Tea Party" in a segment of his radio show last week.&nbsp; Remarking on a lengthy New York Times Magazine piece about the GOP,<a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2011/10/13/gop_elite_declares_war_on_tea_party" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Limbaugh stated</a>:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've got some highlights or quotes that are illustrative here, but this  is an open declaration of war from the GOP elites to the Tea Party, and  it's right there in the New York Times."</p><p>The radio entertainer goes on to quote Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist and lobbyist, who states:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "that’s the secret to politics: trying to control a segment of people  without those people recognizing that you’re trying to control them."</p><p>This is the situation that faces Occupy Wall Street at present.&nbsp; Will the Occupy movement allow itself to become an appendage of the Democratic party, perhaps even without their recognizing it, or will it maintain its political independence from the ruling political class it claims to oppose?&nbsp;</p><p>The second the Tea Party threw in its lot with the GOP, it became incapable of effecting the kinds of structural change that motivated the movement from its inception, because it was integrated into the power structures that support the political status quo.&nbsp; A similar fate may await Occupy Wall Street if the movement fails to maintain its political independence.&nbsp;</p>
