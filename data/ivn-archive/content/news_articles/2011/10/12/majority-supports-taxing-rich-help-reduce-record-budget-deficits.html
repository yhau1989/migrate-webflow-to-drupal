Though the poll found that large majorities opposed raising taxes on the middle class or cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits, a comparably large majority of 81% agreed that middle class Americans will have to make sacrifices to address the federal budget deficit, including 83% of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents.&nbsp;</p><p>The poll of 1000 adults nationwide was conducted by telephone from October 6 to October 9.&nbsp; The full results have a margin of error of 3.5%.&nbsp; The sample of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents has a margin of error of 6%.&nbsp;</p><p>A CBS News Poll conducted between September 28 and October 2 lends credence to the overall numbers found by The Washington Post and Bloomberg News.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20114988-503544.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News poll</a> found that 64% of all respondents supported increasing taxes on millionaires in order to lower the budget deficit, including 83% of Democrats, 65% of Independents and 40% of Republicans.</p>
