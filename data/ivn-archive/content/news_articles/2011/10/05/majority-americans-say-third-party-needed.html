Schoen LLC in April  found that 57% of Americans said the country needs a third party, as Patrick Caddell and Douglas Schoen reported in an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903461304576524313844439194.html?mod=djemEditorialPage_h" rel="noopener noreferrer">op-ed</a> for the Wall Street Journal over the summer.&nbsp;</p><p>A majority of Americans say the country needs Independent and third party alternatives to the Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; The question is, however, when will they actually begin to support them?</p>
