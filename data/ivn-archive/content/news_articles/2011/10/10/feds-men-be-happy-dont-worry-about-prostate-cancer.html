And it flies in the face of the way medicine is practiced at centers of excellence such as UC-San Francisco, where I received my screening for the possibility of prostate cancer.</p><p>During September of this year, the hospital’s highly-regarded Helen Diller Cancer Center was holding its own prostate cancer awareness month.&nbsp; The male doctors were all growing beards as part of the campaign, and there were posters throughout the facility featuring the hirsute physicians looking determined to both avoid razors and beat cancer.&nbsp; These were not people willing to stop or even delay their pursuit of prostate cancer prevention on the word of a panel of statistics-wielding bureaucrats.</p><p>Yet, this is exactly the style of bureaucracy that becomes the fodder of anti-health reform advocates who love to turn such groups of white-coated pronouncers into “death panels.”&nbsp; If it’s my body that becomes ravaged with cancer when my insurance company precludes me from taking a PSA test or getting a resultant biopsy based on the Task Force findings, then this group might as well be a death panel.</p><p>The problem here is a familiar one – it’s not the decision of doctors and patients; instead, it’s up to the insurance providers.&nbsp; And the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has just given the insurance companies ammunition to deny coverage on one more preventive approach that might save lives but can’t be justified according to some mathematical formulation.&nbsp; I’m just glad I got my test in before the big announcement out of Washington.&nbsp; But what about the next guy?</p>
