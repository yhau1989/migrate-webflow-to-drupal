<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Blog_BofAATM1.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://Blog_BofAATM1.jpg" title="Bank of America and the $5 Revolution" width="300"></a></p><p>Bank of America may have tipped the scales toward a true movement of independence in 21st century America.&nbsp; By announcing that it would charge $5 per month for use of a debit card beginning early next year, the bank has single-handedly dumped a new inflationary burden onto many Americans who shop for items such as groceries and clothing using their debit cards.&nbsp; And the bank is doing so just at the time when Americans can least afford it – with the economy teetering on the edge of yet another recession.</p><p>The $5 a month fee for debit cards comes on top of a continuous escalation of charges for use of ATM machines to retrieve cash from bank accounts.&nbsp; The new charge adds yet another layer of cost to the ability to use your own money in a safe and convenient manner.&nbsp; For many families, particularly in low and moderate income neighborhoods, carrying cash into stores is much more risky than shopping with a debit card.&nbsp; Loading an extra $60 a year in fees for use of a debit card seems both cruel and insensitive to our most vulnerable citizens. Meanwhile, B of A and the entire banking industry continue to do quite well, thank you, partially as a result of a bail-out in which we risked hundreds of billions in public funds to ensure that these “too big to fail” entities would endure as the stalwarts of our economic recovery.</p><p>It is no coincidence that a tiny Wall Street sit-in is now <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2011/09/occupy_wall_street_make_banks_pay_in_california.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">metastasizing</a> into a national movement against the financial industry, and that we are beginning to see the signs of violent protection of the wealthy infrastructure by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/occupy-wall-street-on-the-brooklyn-bridge-2011-10" rel="noopener noreferrer">pepper-spray wielding cops</a> who have an innate link to the powers that be.&nbsp;</p><p>The question for Bank of America’s management is this:&nbsp; do they believe that it is their customers who must make all the sacrifices in these economic times?&nbsp; Do they not see themselves as playing any role whatsoever in America’s economic recovery vs. their own individual corporate success?</p><p>This is not the old Bank of America that was the brainchild of Amadeo Giannini, an Italian immigrant who wanted to help his fellow immigrants.&nbsp; He <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America" rel="noopener noreferrer">founded</a> the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to overcome the prejudice that standard American banks displayed toward immigrants, and went national as B of A in 1929.</p><p>Today’s Bank of America contains the old San Francisco-based operation, but its heart and soul is Charlotte-based NCNB (North Carolina National Bank), which has gone through a number of transitions, name changes and growth spurts to become the nation’s largest and most aggressive bank.&nbsp; While the bank has suffered through some weak earnings, those problems have mostly been the result of the purchase of Countrywide Mortgage (a demand placed on B of A by the Federal government under the TARP agreement, but at a cost of only $.10 on the dollar) and its own poor judgments in the mortgage arena.&nbsp; For the most part, the bank is making money hand over fist.</p><p>It currently sits on <a href="http://investor.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&amp;p=irol-irhome" rel="noopener noreferrer">top of the industry</a> in both assets and equity holdings.&nbsp; And while it has had an earnings problem because of the aforementioned mortgage issues, its second quarter profit, excluding real estate issues, was nearly <a href="http://ahead.bankofamerica.com/inside-our-company/bank-of-america-reports-second-quarter-2011-financial-results/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 billion</a> (third quarter earnings will be announced October 18).</p><p>The reality is, B of A and every other major bank in America could well afford to live without $5, $3, or any other per use charge for its debit cards.&nbsp; But America’s citizens cannot afford to pay those charges.&nbsp; And it is doubtful whether this time around the public is going to stand for the gouging of its recession-ravaged income by these fat cat and TARP-buoyed financial institutions.</p><p>It’s high time that a movement of real independence form to oppose the power that has accumulated on Wall Street and in the halls of America’s banking industry, a power that has been largely facilitated by both major parties.&nbsp; Let $5 be the rallying cry for the new revolution.</p>
