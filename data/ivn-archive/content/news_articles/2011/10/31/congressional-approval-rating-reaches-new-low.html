<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/capitol_hill_lg.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="212" src="cloudinary://capitol_hill_lg.jpg" title="capitol_hill_lg" width="360"></a>Though the country remains evenly split on its assessment of the President, there is little disagreement with regard to the Congress.&nbsp; Just 9% of Americans approve of the way Congress is handling its job, according to a recent poll by CBS News and The New York Times, an historic low demonstrating deep discontent with the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>

<p>Asked whether they approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as President, respondents to the poll were evenly split overall, with 46% saying they approve and 46% saying they disapprove.&nbsp; Predictably, the responses of Democrats and Republicans were basically mirror images of one another. 85% of Republicans disapproved of the President's job performance, while 78% of Democrats approved.</p>

<p>Independents, on the other hand, more closely approximated the breakdown of the sample as a whole, though they leaned toward disapproval. 42% of Indepenents stated they approve of the job the President is doing, while 47% disapproved.</p>

<p>Querying respondents as to whether they approve or disapprove of the way the Congress is handling its job, the survey found a broad nonpartisan consensus that something is deeply wrong with the federal legislature, in which the House is controlled by Republicans and the Senate by Democrats. Overall, 84% of respondents said they disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, compared to just 9% who said they approve.&nbsp; This breakdown was consistent across partisan lines: 83% of Republicans, 83% of Democrats and 85% of Independents voiced disapproval of Congress.</p>

<p>Few Americans have any trust in the federal government to do the right thing on any given matter.&nbsp; Only 10% of those surveyed said they trust the government in Washington DC to do what is right all or most of the time, while 89% stated that the federal government can be trusted to do what is right only sometimes or never.</p>

<p>Independents were most likely to never trust the government in Washington DC to do the right thing.&nbsp; 17% of Independents said the federal government can never be trusted to do what is right, compared to 14% of Republicans and 6% of Democrats.</p>

<p>Independents were, understandably, most likely to be skeptical of both Republican and Democratic party economic proposals.&nbsp; 60% of Independents said they do not think the President has a clear plan to create jobs, and 75% said the same of Republicans in Congress.&nbsp; Like the majority of Americans, Independent respondents to the survey supported investments in infrastructure, and tax cuts and reduced regulations for small businesses.&nbsp; They opposed tax cuts for large corporations.</p>
