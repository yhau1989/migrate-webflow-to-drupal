These include the problems of open burning, forest fuel reductions, and the threat of catastrophic wildfires."</p><p>Mr. Patching goes on to say, "I am distressed when I see government agencies nurture false conclusions."</p><p>Finally, there is the question of whether Kings Beach was selected for the biomass plant because it simply does not appear as capable of defending itself as well as some of Lake Tahoe's more affluent towns.&nbsp; Where would this proposal stand if it was being recommended for Incline Village, or for the Tahoe-Donner neighborhood of Truckee?&nbsp; This is NIMBY in reverse -- PIITBY.&nbsp; Put It In Their Back Yard.</p>
