“The  Citizens Redistricting Commission, built upon a hopeful ideal of  enhancing political competition in legislative and congressional  districts, has now descended into a cesspool of corruption, and the  promise of fair new districts has been compromised by brutal partisan  politics instigated by the commission itself,” wrote <a href="http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/blog/tony-quinn/8774-corrupting-redistricting-commission" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Quinn</a> following the Commission’s decision in favor of Q2. &nbsp;</p><p>As a member of the  Rose Institute’s Board of Governors, Quinn is obviously anything but an  impartial observer. &nbsp;</p><p>Yet,  such controversy demonstrated that the multi-partisan composition of  the Commission could not insulate it from the rabid partisanship that  defines Republican-Democrat party politics. &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, in  early April, the California Independent Voter Project (CAIVP) issued a formal <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2011/04/09/caivp-exhorts-citizens-redistricting-commission-follow-non-partisan-guidelines" rel="noopener noreferrer">public comment</a> to the Commission underscoring the fact that the Voters First Act  specifically prohibits it from considering any criteria related to  political party affiliation. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “With over 50% of California's voters  identifying themselves as "independent" or "non-partisan", regardless of  their formal registration, CAIVP's quest for a strictly non-partisan  approach to redistricting could be critical in the fight for fair and  competitive elections,” wrote Ryan Jaroncyk here at CAIVN.&nbsp;</p><p>The  difficulty of securing an explicitly non-partisan approach even in a  reformed redistricting process is clear in the very language used to  talk about the Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>In their everyday speech, Democrats and  Republicans often equate bipartisanship with non-partisanship, despite  the fact that a bipartisan process literally cannot be non-partisan  since, by definition, it excludes Independents and third party  supporters. &nbsp;Indeed, the Commission’s multi-partisan character  implicitly acknowledges the fact that a bipartisan body cannot be a  non-partisan body.&nbsp; Interestingly,  however, the fact that the Commission has been charged with  redistricting the state along non-partisan lines appears to have created  the impression in the minds of some that it is a bipartisan body. &nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201103311000" rel="noopener noreferrer">KQED broadcast</a> discussing the new redistricting process described Proposition 11 in  the following manner: &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The measure took the drawing of legislative  districts out of the hands of lawmakers, and instead put it into the  hands of a bipartisan organization called the Citizens Redistricting Commission” [emphasis added]. &nbsp;</p><p>A recent article in the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/31/BU281JMGDP.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco Chronicle</a> considered the effects the process might have on various communities, stating:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Depending on how the bipartisan commission  draws the maps, San Francisco's Asian American community could see its  power diminished” [emphasis added]. &nbsp;</p><p>Even the Commissioners themselves  have revealed this bias in discussing the body’s work! &nbsp;In an article  for the <a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_17701119" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contra Costa Times</a>, one of the Republican members of Commission,  Vince Barabba, has been quoted saying:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Everything that is done is  going to be done in public and under the bipartisan commission's direction” [emphasis added].</p><p>The bipolar ideology that sustains the two-party system has so warped our politics that Independents are unconsciously excluded from discussions of a public commission in which they have been explicitly included, ironically, in order to counteract the most pernicious effects of two-party politics. The two-party state is, first and foremost, a state of mind.</p><p>Independents must be sure to have their voices heard as the redistricting process moves forward, else they will simply be drowned out, ignored or forgotten.&nbsp; Comments can be submitted to the Commission at any of its open hearings or by using its <a href="http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/contact_public_comment.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">online submission form</a>.</p>
