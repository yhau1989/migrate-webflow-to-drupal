While guaranteed placement for the state’s top high school students remain in place, today’s in-state tuition has ballooned to approximately $11,300, not including books and other fees&nbsp; – an exclusionary amount for many families.&nbsp; And there is no guarantee as to which UC a high performing California student will be accepted.</p><p><br>Under the new plans, state students must compete for spots at the most prestigious UCs with aspirants from across the country and around the world.&nbsp; Davis is generally ranked between third and fifth among the UCs depending on the rating system.&nbsp; Berkeley and UCLA are usually considered the top two UCs.&nbsp; Davis is one of the top schools in the nation for viticulture, veterinary medicine and bio-technology and one of five UCs with a medical school.</p><p><br>Chancellor Katehi’s program cannot go forward without funding for campus infrastructure to support the 5,000 additional students, most of whom will require dorm space for at least some of their college stay.&nbsp; The city of Davis itself will also need to find the means to support this growth in student population (and its concomitant increase in bicycles, skateboards and motor scooters).&nbsp;</p><p><br>But the program may well save one of the region’s most powerful engines of growth.&nbsp; UC Davis has helped power the success of Napa and Sonoma wine growers, the bio-tech revolution that has been centered in the Vacaville region, and the solar energy industry that is just beginning to take wing in Sacramento.&nbsp; Silicon Valley would never be where it is today without the presence of the UCs at Berkley and Santa Cruz, as well as Stanford University and San Jose State.&nbsp; The state and region cannot afford to let its great universities whither because budgets are shrinking.&nbsp;</p><p><br>And while the creative approaches our great universities use might well turn them into some sort of hybrids between public and private institutions that can no longer serve the people of California as they did 40 years ago, at least they will be saved for future generations.&nbsp; Go Aggies!</p>
