Michele Bachmann isn't either. She'll be headlining the state party's convention this month as the opening keynote speaker on Friday. The Republican Party of California's chairman, Tom Del Beccaro, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=95590" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> he's expecting other candidates to show up to the event as well.</p><p>While Ron Paul took first in a California straw poll at the state party's convention this March, the results may not be too surprising because the poll was conducted by the libertarian-leaning Republican Liberty Caucus of California. This September's straw poll will be conducted by the state party, and has been hyped as a high-profile poll and litmus test akin to the historic Ames Iowa Straw Poll.</p><p>With a first place win at the CPAC straw poll this February and a statistical tie for first at Ames, Ron Paul's prospects still look solid, but it appears that he wants to make absolutely sure, with a speech at the convention, where Paul's campaign has confirmed he'll spend the entire day on Saturday, attending events and greeting voters.</p>
