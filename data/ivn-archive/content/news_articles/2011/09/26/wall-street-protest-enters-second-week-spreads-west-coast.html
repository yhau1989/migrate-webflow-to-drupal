Individuals from dozens of states  across the Union can be found at the encampment: from Maine to Florida, Texas to Michigan, California to Oregon, and even Alaska.&nbsp;</p><p>Wiljago  Cook, a young woman from Oakland, California, said she quit her job and  bought a one-way ticket to New York to take part in the protests and  assemblies. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This is too important not to attend and participate,” she  said, “I wanted to do what I could to help start this movement.”</p><p>Not  all are planning to stay in New York indefinitely, however. &nbsp;Many  intend to return home to build the movement and spread its message.  &nbsp;Yumi, a young professional visiting New York from San Francisco, has  been following developments surrounding the protests very closely. &nbsp;“My  hope is to bring knowledge and tactics back to San Francisco, where the  movement has been slowly and steadily building,” she said. &nbsp;Over a  hundred people demonstrated in San Francisco’s financial district last  week to coincide with the New York protests.</p><p>Occupation protests are now being planned across the country. &nbsp;<a href="http://occupytogether.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupy Together</a> has become the informal umbrella website for the burgeoning network.  &nbsp;It states that assemblies are being planned in over thirty cities  across the country, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.&nbsp;</p><p>If  there is one issue that unites all the demonstrators, it may well be  the fact that they feel they have no voice in government, and that they  are not represented by either Democrats or Republicans. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The two-party  system does not represent most people’s viewpoints,” said Ms. Cook, “we  want to create a new way to come to consensus about what we want as a  society.”</p><p>Unlike  most protests and rallies, which are organized in a rigidly  hierarchical manner, the occupation protests utilize a form of  consensus-driven direct democracy, the general assembly, to plan their  actions and organize day-to-day activities. Smaller working groups are  devoted to everything from food and shelter to media, arts and culture.</p><p>The assemblies in New York have been streamed live online, and their minutes are <a href="http://nycga.cc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> to the web. &nbsp;Similar organizing assemblies were held in <a href="http://occupysf.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/occupyLA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles</a> over the weekend.</p>
