"Today marks the end of out-of-state retailers using loopholes in our laws to skirt collecting sales tax revenue."</p><p><br>So both sides were probably doing the old political “nod and wink” as they shook hands over the agreement to pull out of a headlong race toward political disaster.&nbsp; And if two people wink, that could be construed to be a blink anyway, couldn’t it?</p>
