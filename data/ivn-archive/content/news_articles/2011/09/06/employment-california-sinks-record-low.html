<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/job seekers in san francisco.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://job%20seekers%20in%20san%20francisco.png" title="Employment in California sinks to record low" width="300"></a></p><p>In more troubling economic news, a recent report released by the Sacramento-based California Budget Project stated that the percentage of working-age Californians with jobs has reached a new record low, and that employment levels may not fully recover until the second half of this decade.</p><p>According to the report, only 55.4% of working-age Californians (defined as those 16 and older) had a job in July, down nearly a percent from last year and at the lowest level since 1976. With a 12 percent unemployment rate this summer, California has the second highest rate of unemployment in the nation.</p><p>But in another startling figure, the research group reports that women have trailed men in regaining jobs lost when the recession hit in 2008. In a phone interview with Bloomberg, the California Budget Project's deputy director, Alissa Anderson, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-04/california-employment-level-sinks-to-record-low-as-fewer-women-find-jobs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Women represent nearly half of the workforce. They gained just one of the 10 jobs added [gained back in California since 2008]."</p><p>Women aren't the only minority disproportionately affected by the recession and bleak job prospects. I <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/08/24/california-unemployment-rate-stays-above-12-while-black-unemployment-extremely-hi" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> last summer that:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "while white males in the United States had a 9.5% unemployment rate for  July, black males experienced a whopping 17.8% unemployment rate, nearly  twice that of their white counterparts."</p><p>Job prospects for Americans are bad right now. In California, they're worse. For California's women and black men, they're the worst.</p><p>This is also bad news for California's budget. This July, CAIVN's Bob Morris <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2011/07/12/california-budget-assumes-sustained-recovery-even-economy-slows" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that California's most recent state budget will only balance on the assumption of sustained economic recovery and growth, a prospect that is looking more and more unlikely, as the recent jobs report indicates.</p><p>So just what can California do to balance its budget? Perhaps it could stop focusing on the budget so much and start focusing on growth. California policymakers <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2009/08/10/employment-debate-focuses-creaky-wheels-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer">need to focus</a> on a comprehensive strategy to reform and improve California's business climate in order to attract more companies that create high-paying jobs. Economic growth is what will create jobs, expand state revenues, and improve the standard of living for California's residents.</p>
