Campbell of Notre Dame and Robert D. Putnam of Harvard to be virtually indistinguishable from its big brother Republican party (though this study seems to implicitly focus on the post-Obama development of the Tea Party, and not the pre-Obama, Ron Paul-inspired tea party movement which launched in 2007).<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p> </p><p>Offshoot parties, if powerful enough, may change the equation of an election enough to help ensure success by candidates from the opposite political spectrum.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, on either state or national levels and with the rare exceptions of name-brand contenders such as Minnesota Governor <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/mngov/keystories.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Ventura</a>, third party candidates do not win elections<strong>.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p> </p><p>However, acting on your non-partisan impulses can be satisfied despite the fact that there may be no Independent candidates in clear view, by thinking independently.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, you can choose to broaden your thinking by considering the ideas of think tanks, academics and columnists you have heretofore rejected because they represent “the other side.”<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re a progressive, start giving serious consideration to spokesmen from the American Enterprise Institute, right or right-center columnists such as David Brooks and George Wills, and economists from George Mason University or Pepperdine’s Business School.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re conservative, imbibe in left or left-center columnists such as Paul Krugman and E.J. Dionne, Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, and the Pew Research Center.<span>&nbsp; </span>Liberals can spend time with the editorial page of the Wall St. Journal and Conservatives can do the same with the New York Times. &nbsp;<span></span>You might be surprised at what you learn.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not a question of becoming convinced or changed as a person; it’s the idea of increasing your independence by widening your perspective.</p><p> </p><p>It’s my personal practice to read and/or watch certain media outlets only to understand the degree to which they stretch the truth.<span>&nbsp; </span>These include certain anchors on Fox News, MSNBC and now Current TV, and such print publications as Hot Air and Daily Kos.<span>&nbsp; </span>By comparing what I view as propaganda-oriented media outlets with more journalistically mainstream sources, I create my own independent filter that helps clarify my thinking amidst the fog of hype and big money influence that marks today’s media environment.</p><p> </p><p>Independence is more than just a label.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s also a mindset that each of us has the right and responsibility to achieve.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
