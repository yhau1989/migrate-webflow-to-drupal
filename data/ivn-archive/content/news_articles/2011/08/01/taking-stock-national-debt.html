Bush sent to Congress and pushed through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act" rel="noopener noreferrer">most expensive addition</a> to Medicare in its history, the Medicare prescription drug plan.&nbsp; On the other hand, President Clinton has been <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/07/23/997911/-Inconceivable%21" rel="noopener noreferrer">excoriated</a> by Daily Kos and other far left Democratic publications for his stated desire to trim the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.</p><p><br><br><strong>Talking Point</strong>:&nbsp; President Obama <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2009/08/28/obama%E2%80%99s-tripling-of-the-national-debt-in-pictures/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tripled</a> the national debt in his first few months in office.</p><p><br><br><strong>Reality</strong>:&nbsp; The national debt increased <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2011/07/national_debt_up_35_percent_du.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">35 percent</a> during President Obama’s first 30 months in office, but it had increased 40 percent during President Bush’s final term in office. Realistically, the momentum created by one administration cannot be instantaneously stopped without causing a dire effect on the economy – especially in a recession.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br><strong>Talking Point</strong>:&nbsp; America’s taxes are the highest in the world.</p><p><br><br><strong>Reality</strong>:&nbsp; While taxes may seem high to you and me, in terms of GDP, they are actually <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/09/tea-party-taxes-opinions-columnists-bartlett.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest</a> among the 15 most developed nations.</p><p><br><br><strong>Debt-Causing Culprits:&nbsp; Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Military Spending, Recession</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>These are the five major causes of our debt crisis.&nbsp; Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are directly related to our aging population and the rising cost of healthcare.&nbsp; Military spending has spun nearly out of control since the tragic events of 9/11 and the United States’ attempt to intercede against terrorists around the world.</p><p><br><br>In fact, between 2001 and 2009, <a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/File:U.S._Defense_Spending_Trends.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">increases</a> in military spending were second only to Medicare at the top of the federal list, and lagged the seniors' health care plan by a mere .1 percent.&nbsp; Since 2000, DOD spending has increased from $300 billion to more than $700 billion, of which approximately $175 billion is currently credited to overseas wars.&nbsp; During those same years, Medicare and Medicaid have <a href="http://www.nhbizreport.com/Public-Policy/US-Economic-Policy/US-Medicare/Medicaid-Spending-2000-2020.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased</a> from $312 billion to nearly $800 billion, and Social Security has <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2010/06/federal-spending-by-the-numbers-2010" rel="noopener noreferrer">grown</a> from $524 billion to $721 billion.</p><p><br><br>Perhaps the top cause of government debt is the lack of tax receipts that occur when the economy hits a rough patch.&nbsp; Since the Great Depression in 1929, this nation has suffered through <a href="http://www.stocktradingtogo.com/2008/07/18/timeline-of-all-recessions-and-world-crises-since-great-depression/" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 recessions</a> and numerous lesser downturns.&nbsp; Those recessions began under four Democratic administrations and six Republican administrations. Until recently, these downturns have lasted only a year or two.&nbsp; But in 1988, we experienced a recession lasting nearly four years based on the collapse of junk bonds.</p><p><br><br>Toward the end of George W. Bush’s second term in 2007, we suffered a massive housing bubble burst and the near collapse of our banking system.&nbsp; While economists consider that recession to have ended in technical terms in 2010, most Americans continue to feel its effects, and many politicians still wrestle with the right way to deal with this massive downturn.&nbsp;</p><p>So, should we spend more to stimulate the economy or curtail spending to reduce our debt?&nbsp; Whatever choices we make must be driven by facts rather than pre-packaged talking points.&nbsp; It behooves all Americans to pay close attention to the details.</p>
