That  includes 72% of Democrats, 63% of Independents and 40% of Republicans.  &nbsp;Interestingly, even more respondents were supportive of ongoing efforts  by the state to address the issue. &nbsp;67% said they support the Global  Warming Solution Act of 2006, which requires California to significantly  reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. On this particular issue,  Republicans remain more divided than Democrats or Independents, though a  plurality of GOP supporters (45%) favor the law.&nbsp;</p><p>Across  partisan lines, a wide majority of the state’s residents favor  reductions in emissions by industry and automobiles (82%, 81% respectively), an  increase in renewable energy by utilities (82%) &nbsp;and increases in the  energy efficiency of buildings and appliances (74%). &nbsp;A 27% plurality  identify air pollution as the more important environmental issue facing  California today; 66% believe air pollution is a big problem or  somewhat of a big problem, compared with 33% who believe it is not  a problem.</p><p>Generally,  Californians have more trust in local and state government than they do  in the federal government when it comes to addressing environmental  problems. &nbsp;35% said they trust local government the most, compared with  24% who favor the state and 20% who said they trust the federal  government the most. &nbsp;12% stated that they do not trust the local, state  or federal government to deal with environmental problems, including  17% of Independents, 17% of Republicans and 9% of Democrats.&nbsp;</p><p>The  poll also gauged the approval ratings of Governor Jerry Brown and the  state legislature. &nbsp;Among likely voters, 48% approved of the job Brown is  doing as governor, while only 36% supported his handling of  environmental issues. Californians remain highly critical of the state  legislature. &nbsp;59% disapprove of the way state lawmakers are handling  their job, including 78% of Republicans, 72% of Independents and 63% of  Democrats. &nbsp;On environmental issues, Californians are somewhat more  forgiving. &nbsp;Just 44% disapprove of the way the state legislature is  handling environmental issues, while 31% said they approve. &nbsp;</p><p>Querying  respondents as to their political affiliation, 45% identified  themselves as Democrats, 32% stated that they are Republicans, 19% said  they are Independents, and 4% said they affiliate with some other party.  &nbsp;Though there are fewer self-identified Independents in California than  there are in the nation as a whole, there are proportionally more  so-called “pure” Independents in the Golden State. &nbsp;Nationally,  Independents (36%) outnumber both Democrats (32%) and Republicans (26%),  according to Pollster.com’s average across a wide variety of surveys.  &nbsp;However, anywhere from 80-90% of Independents nationwide say they lean  toward one or the other major party. &nbsp;In California, the PPIC survey  found that 33% of self-identified Independents do not lean toward either  the Republican or Democratic party.&nbsp;</p><p>The  poll’s results are based on a telephone survey of 2,504 adult residents  throughout the state, and have a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.  &nbsp;The survey can be read in its entirety at the <a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=993" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPIC’s website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
