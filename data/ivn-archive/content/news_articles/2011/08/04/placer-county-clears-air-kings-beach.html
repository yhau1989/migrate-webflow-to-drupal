This evidence should be forthcoming, along with a resolution by the Board of the TRPA banning all further consideration of any biomass power plants in the Lake Tahoe Basin in order to maintain the integrity of this Outstanding National Resource Water of Lake Tahoe.”</p><p><br>Citizens of tiny Kings Beach can breathe easier today, and in days to come, because a well-meant but potentially disastrous action appears to have been corrected.<br><br></p>
