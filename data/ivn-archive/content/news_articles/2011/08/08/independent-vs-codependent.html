This is mainly because independents don’t  really exist,” he writes, echoing the assertions of observers who are ideologically and institutionally invested in the maintenance of  the two-party state.</p><p>At <em>The New Republic</em>, on  the other side of the duopoly divide, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/93041/obama-independent-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruy Teixeira</a> makes the very same  point, on the basis of the very same article, but from a Democratic  perspective. &nbsp;He argues that President Obama should not reach out to  Independents because Independents effectively do not exist. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To  understand how very unlikely it is that Obama’s long sought-after deal  is going to magically turn around his numbers, we must visit one of the  most robust but amazingly underappreciated findings in American  political science: independents are not independent,” writes Teixeira.</p><p>Here  we see a rare point of overt agreement between the partisans of the  Democratic and Republican parties:&nbsp; Independents should be ignored in  favor of courting and consolidating the dwindling number of Democratic  and Republican party adherents across the country. &nbsp;</p><p>This situation  makes one thing crystal clear. &nbsp;So long as Independents continue voting  for, or otherwise supporting, Democrats and Republicans, it is a virtual  certainty that they will continue to lack adequate representation in  government. So long as Independents allow themselves to be held  politically hostage by the ideologues of the two-party state and the  entrenched interests that maintain both the Democratic and Republican  parties, they are not Independent; instead, they are codependent.&nbsp;</p>
