The Pentagon&nbsp;<a href="http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/08/17/USTC-tapped-for-Afghan-intel-work/UPI-64501313597799/" rel="noopener noreferrer">has hired</a>&nbsp;a  subsidiary of the mercenary firm, US Training Center Inc. (USTC) to  help fight its raging Afgan drug war. This, in spite of probes by both  the State and Defense Departments regarding misconduct by Xe officials  within Afghanistan for, among other things, defrauding the State  Department and reportedly misappropriating government weaponry.</p><p> </p><p>Xe  CEO Ted Wright says the new contract reaffirms his company's ability to  provide “all-source intelligence expertise.” Officially, Xe mercenaries  will be delivering “intelligence analyst support and material  procurement” for NATO in its “counter-narcoterrorism activities in  Afghanistan.” In other words, they will be helping NATO stabilize poppy  production in the world's largest opium producing nation.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile in Afghanistan, suicide bombers&nbsp;<a href="http://thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=20812&amp;title=Four-die-in-attack-near-Afghan-NATO-base" rel="noopener noreferrer">struck a NATO supply depot at Kandahar airfield</a>&nbsp;Wednesday,  killing four security contractors and injuring eight others. The  Taliban took credit for the attack. That same day, an unmanned U.S.&nbsp;<a href="http://defense.aol.com/2011/08/17/drone-collides-over-afghanistan-with-u-s-warplane?icid=maing-grid7%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec3_lnk3%7C87289" rel="noopener noreferrer">drone collided with a C-130</a>, causing minor damage to the cargo plane and raising concerns about the safety of using drones in crowded airspace.</p><p> </p><p>On the subject of drones, former CIA Director and current Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/16/panetta-sees-no-need-to-ease-drone-strikes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued statements</a>&nbsp;at  a National Defense University event on Tuesday defending the largely  clandestine and unilateral bombing campaigns over Pakistan and  Afghanistan. For Panetta, “we're defending our country,” but for many  firsthand witnesses and on-the-ground researchers of the drone-war, we  are fueling a perpetual cycle of violence by killing innocent civilians.  For instance, researcher Noor Behram&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/17/us-drone-strikes-pakistan-waziristan" rel="noopener noreferrer">insists</a>&nbsp;that “for every 10 to 15 people killed, maybe they get one militant.” A recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/most-complete-picture-yet-of-cia-drone-strikes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) report</a>&nbsp;reinforced  this statement when it revealed that at least 168 children have been  killed by drones in Pakistan alone.&nbsp; Panetta disagrees and says all  killed have been terrorists. Without a defined enemy and Due Process, we  shall never know how accurate Panetta's stance is.</p><p> </p><p>On Wednesday, the Pentagon Chief commented&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65061" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the Defense Department's website</a>&nbsp;that  the U.S. Has “invested a lot of blood in [Iraq]” and that because of  this, Iraq now entertains a “relatively stable democracy.” Panetta  insists this in spite of heavy and sustained violence in the country,  including attacks this month that have proven to be among the deadliest  of the year. He further announced that the U.S. would have a “long-term”  relationship with Iraq no matter what, reiterating a call for Iraq to  request a continued U.S. troop presence – an idea that Iraqi officials  are<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gq8B_9ICeVzcEmQYvJQsVQ1VdmUQ?docId=CNG.787930529cb0f756929e6bf9bf0e5d8e.701" rel="noopener noreferrer"> now souring to</a>.</p>
