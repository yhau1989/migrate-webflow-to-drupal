This may  well explain why there is such fierce opposition to HCR from corporate  interests. Their pet cash cows are getting gored. It has nothing to do  with health care.</p><p>Here's some background to put the issue in its proper context. Selling tax shelters is big  business.  Shelters with more than a few participants must be registered  with the IRS, but “customized” plans do not require registration and  are often not disclosed. They are designed to generate paper “tax  losses” for corporations while involving little or no actual economic  risk or cash outlay. Designing and marketing these schemes generate  millions in fees for investment banks, attorneys, and accounting firms.  This is big money indeed and goes deep into the heart of corporate  America.</p><p>The new law provides:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “that, in the case of any  transaction to which the economic substance doctrine is relevant” [.i.e a  tax shelter],”the transaction shall be treated as having economic  substance only if (i) the transaction changes in a meaningful way (apart  from Federal income tax effects) the taxpayer’s economic position, and  (ii) the taxpayer has a substantial purpose (apart from Federal income  tax effects) for entering into the transaction.”</p><p>The IRS has now  codified the economic substance doctrine into a two-pronged test across  the country which supercedes the varying previous interpretations in  different federal circuits.</p><p>So, a tax shelter must now have  economic substance, and it must have a purpose other than federal tax  reduction. Further, the IRS will challenge taxpayers who try to slide in  under the old interpretations. Also, penalties have been increased from  20% to 40% for underpayment of tax liability.</p><p>This is a  heat-seeking missile into tax shelters. I can hear the fat cats yowling  from here, can’t you? Imagine the effrontery of the government to say  that tax shelters must do something else besides dodge taxes.</p><p>The ABA has <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/aba-notice-2010-62.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">requested clarification</a> from the IRS (PDF):</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This legislation changes the playing field significantly by mandating the  two-prong test and imposing a strict liability penalty. Despite the  detailed consideration of the legislation over the years, the 2010 Act  did not resolve major pre-existing ambiguities in the economic substance  doctrine (e.g., what counts as a substantial business purpose) and  brings to the fore a number of other ambiguities, most particularly the  question of when the doctrine is relevant."</p><p>Translation.  We’ve had a swell gravy train going for a while helping corporations  evade billions in taxes and this new statute is mucking things up.  Please make your law less broad so we can wriggle around it.</p><p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-62.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">The IRS answers</a> (PDF):</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Section  7701(o)(5)(A) states that the term “economic substance doctrine” means  the common law doctrine under which tax benefits under subtitle A with  respect to a transaction are not allowable if the transaction does not  have economic substance or lacks a business purpose."</p><p>Translation: we need a big net for big fish — you won’t be getting a pass.</p><p>Make  no mistake. This is a big deal for serious anti-tax shelter tightening.   Is it extreme to conclude that if corporations (who don’t care whether  or not we buy health insurance coverage) can get the little people  foaming at the mouth about HCR —  if they can persuade us to repeal the  bill in its entirety — then maybe big business will be able eliminate  that noxious anti-tax shelter rider while no one is paying attention?   And the Tea Party will have then been played, as will the rest of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* Editor's note- This post is a slightly re-worded version of Bob's "Politics in the Zeros" <a href="http://polizeros.com/2011/02/08/health-care-reform-bill-contains-heat-seeking-missile-against-tax-shelters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>.</p>
