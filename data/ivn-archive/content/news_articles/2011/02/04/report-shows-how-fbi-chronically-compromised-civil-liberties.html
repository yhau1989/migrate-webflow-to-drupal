According to information uncovered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a startling track record of illegal and intrusive intelligence investigation practices.</p><p> </p><p>The EFF has reviewed nearly 2,500 pages of documents obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request that detail violations reported to the Intelligence Oversight Board by the FBI from 2001 to 2008. <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/patterns-misconduct-fbi-intelligence-violations" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their analysis</a> reveals that the civil liberties of Americans are at a greater risk of being compromised than civil libertarians previously thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some key points of the report:<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2001 to 2008, the FBI documented 768 violations, but it claims to have investigated at least 7,000 potential legal violations by agents.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among “potential and actual” violations reported were the use of improper evidence to obtain federal grand jury subpoenas, false or inaccurate submissions of declarations to courts, and the warrant-less access of password-protected documentations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-third of the violations dealt with internal oversight of intelligence investigations.</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abuse, misuse, or the careless use of the Bureau's National Security Letter (NSL) made up another third of the violations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In nearly half of all NSL violations, third-parties to whom NSLs were issued — phone companies, internet service providers, financial institutions, and credit agencies —contributed in some way to the FBI’s unauthorized receipt of personal information.</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violations<span> of the Constitution, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or other laws governing criminal investigations or intelligence gathering activities accounted for almost one-fifth of reported abuses.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2002 to 2006, the phone records of thousands of US citizens were collected and monitored.</span></p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were substantial delays in the intelligence oversight process; on average, 2.5 years elapsed between a violation’s occurrence and its eventual reporting to the IOB, the report found.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In all, the number of times the FBI exceeded its legal authority in the first seven years of the "Age of the Patriot Act" could be as high as 40,000. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
