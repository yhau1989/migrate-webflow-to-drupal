<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/obama-says-polarized-nation-needs-healing-2011-01-13_l.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://obama-says-polarized-nation-needs-healing-2011-01-13_l.jpg" title="President Obama: Polarizer-in-Chief" width="300"></a></p><p>According to Gallup, President Obama has been one of the most polarizing Presidents since 1953.&nbsp; In his first year, 88% of Democrats and 23% of Republicans approved of his performance, representing a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/125345/obama-approval-polarized-first-year-president.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">65 point</a> partisan gap.&nbsp; This easily outranked the previous record of 52 points during President Bill Clinton's first year.&nbsp; But, in President Obama's second year, the gap grew to <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/145937/Obama-Approval-Ratings-Polarized-Year-Year.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">68 points</a>, with 81% of Democrats and 13% of Republicans approving of his performance.&nbsp; This easily defeated the 56 point record during President Ronald Reagan's second year.&nbsp; Overall, Obama's 68 point gap ranks 4th place all-time, trailing President George W. Bush's top three worst finishes at 70, 72, and 76 points respectively.</p><p>Like President George W. Bush, President Obama entered office proclaiming that he would unite the country, work successfully across the aisle, and change the tone of DC's venomous partisanship.&nbsp; Thus far, the numbers seem to indicate that President Obama, like President George W. Bush, has failed in this arena.&nbsp; America remains a highly divided nation.</p><p>However, I would argue that President Obama does not deserve all the blame.&nbsp; For example, shouldn't a much higher percentage of Republicans approve of Obama's performance?&nbsp; After all, President Obama recently extended Bush's tax cuts and has followed a virtually identical foreign policy to that of Bush, spending even more money on the military, sending 51,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and launching a record number of drone strikes in Pakistan.&nbsp; Tax cuts and a hawkish foreign policy were stalwarts of the George W. Bush era.</p><p>And shouldn't a much higher percentage of Democrats disapprove of Obama's performance?&nbsp; After all, he has continued, even escalated, George W. Bush's foreign policy, extended Bush's much-maligned tax cuts, backed down on a public health care option, done little on immigration reform and the environment, and remained resistant to gay marriage.</p><p>Perhaps the American people should bear part of the blame, then. Obama's approval rating, like that of Bush, may be more reflective of a populace that has succumbed to mindless partisanship, rather than independent-minded critical thinking.&nbsp; "Cheering for one's team" has replaced fair-minded evaluation and results-oriented policy assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And what have been the results over the last ten years?&nbsp; A moderate recession, a severe recession, record budget deficits, $9 trillion of more debt, stagnant wages, higher prices, nearly 6,000 dead and over 40,000 wounded US troops, and deteriorating education performance just to name a few.</p><p>Enough said. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
