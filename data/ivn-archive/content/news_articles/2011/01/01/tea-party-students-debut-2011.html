<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Tea Party Protest Nashville.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://Tea%20Party%20Protest%20Nashville.jpg" title="Tea Party Students to debut in 2011" width="300"></a></p><p>In another sign that the Tea Party is mobilizing into an organized political machine with a broad vision and long-term goals, 2011 will see the debut of <em>Tea Party Students</em>. As the name suggests, the new organization will recruit and organize students from America's high schools and universities to advance the Tea Party's political program and philosophy of government.</p><p>What is that philosophy?</p><p>On its <a href="http://teapartystudents.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new website</a>, <em>Tea Party Students</em> lists three "core values" of the Tea Party movement: constitutionally limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility. Citing a Harvard University study that suggested only 11 percent of Americans aged 18 - 29 consider themselves Tea Party supporters, <em>Tea Party Students</em> describes its mission as "nothing less than a campaign to save the Tea Party movement from extinction."</p><p>The public debut of <em>Tea Party Students</em> will be launched by twelve already formally recognized on-campus <em>Tea Party Student</em> groups, including one at Butte College, a community college located in Northern California, the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania; and George Mason University, well-noted for the prominence of its libertarian student and faculty presence.&nbsp; In the spirit of the broader Tea Party movement, <em>Tea Party Students</em> will allow each local chapter to remain 100% autonomous and self-directing, with access to resources that the national organization offers and the prerogative to opt-in to dual affiliations with other national organizations such as the <em>Leadership Institute</em>, <em>Students for Liberty</em>, and <em>Young Americans for Liberty</em>.</p><p>Though conceived and founded by student, Danny Oliver, <em>Tea Party Students</em> has an impressive roster of older Tea Party leaders and activists on its advisory board, including Judson Phillips of <em>Tea Party Nation</em> and Michael Patrick Leahy of the <em>Nationwide Tea Party Coalition</em>.&nbsp; Last month on December 16th, the anniversary of the original Boston Tea Party in 1773, <em>Tea Party Patriots</em> endorsed <em>Tea Party Students</em> as "the future of the Tea Party Movement."</p>
