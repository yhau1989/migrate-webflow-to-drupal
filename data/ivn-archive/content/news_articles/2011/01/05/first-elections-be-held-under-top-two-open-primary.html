George Runner, was elected to the State Board of  Equalization in November 2010. &nbsp;His wife, Sharron Runner, a Republican  and small business owner, is now one of the two candidates in the race.  &nbsp;She will be faced by Democrat Darren Parker, a community activist and  consultant.</p><p>The  special election in the 28th district was called when the previous  office holder, Sen. Jenny Oropeza, was posthumously re-elected by  voters, after having passed away less than two weeks before the November  election. &nbsp;Among the ten candidates who filed nomination papers for the  office, there are four Republicans, three Democrats, two Non-Partisan  candidates and one Libertarian. &nbsp;The two non-partisan candidates are  Mark Lipman, a publisher and community organizer, and Michael Chamness, a  community activist from Venice, CA.&nbsp;</p><p>It  turns out, however, that Chamness is not non-partisan by choice.  &nbsp;Rather, he is a member of the Coffee Party, a liberal group formed in  response to the Tea Party movement, which is not officially recognized  by the state. &nbsp;Under Proposition 14, his affiliation cannot therefore be  listed alongside his name on the primary ballot. &nbsp;Chamness joined the  plaintiffs of the above-mentioned lawsuit against implementation of  Proposition 14 in an appeal filed last November, according to a press  release at <a href="http://businessandelectionlaw.com/sb6/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business and Election Law</a>,  the website of Gautam Dutta, who is representing the plaintiffs in the  case. &nbsp;The release states:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Unless the state’s High Court intervenes,  Mr. Chamness will be banned from identifying himself as a “Coffee Party”  candidate on the ballot. &nbsp;Instead, he will be forced to falsely state  that he has “No Party Preference.”” &nbsp;As quoted by <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/latestnews/ci_17001211" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Breeze</a>,  Chamness appears to have decided to run for the seat at least partially  in protest of Proposition 14, which he said “disenfranchises  third-party candidates.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nontheless,  with name recognition and prior experience in the state legislature,  Democrat Ted Lieu, a former Assemblyman and candidate for Attorney  General, appears to be the candidate most-favored to win the race. &nbsp;Yet,  given the fact that this is both a special election and the first  multi-candidate race in the state under “top two,” it is not known how  voters will respond to the multiplicity of candidates on the ballot, or  even if they will come out to vote in the special election in  significant numbers. &nbsp;Though nearly 50% of registered voters in the  district are Democrats, it is entirely possible that their vote may be  split between the numerous Democratic and progressive candidates on the  ballot. &nbsp;The remainder of the district’s electorate, on the other hand,  is split between the Republicans (25%), Decline-to-State voters (22%),  and third party members (around 5%). &nbsp;With four candidates on the  ballot, and only one in four voters in the district, the odds are  certainly not in the GOP’s favor.&nbsp;</p><p>Unless  one candidate wins the primary outright, we are likely to see a special  general election with two Democrats this summer. &nbsp;But there is always  the question of the independent protest vote.&nbsp;</p>
