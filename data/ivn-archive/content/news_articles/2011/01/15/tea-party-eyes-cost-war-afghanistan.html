More interestingly, two thirds of respondents said that either Washington should reduce troop levels in Afghanistan or withdraw from the region altogether "as soon as possible," with 39% calling for troop reductions and 27% favoring a full withdrawal. Only 24% of self-identified conservatives supported maintaining present troop levels.</p><p>This isn't the first time that signs have indicated conservative opposition to the war in Afghanistan. Outgoing RNC Chairman Michael Steele sparked a firestorm of controversy by suggesting that the war there was Obama's war and a "war of choice" that history teaches us is unwinnable. Conservative columnist Ann Coulter vigorously defended his statements against the criticisms of Bill Kristol and other neoconservative commentators, <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=376" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"At this point, Afghanistan is every bit as much Obama's war as Vietnam was Lyndon Johnson's war. True, President Kennedy was the first to send troops to Vietnam. We had 16,000 troops in Vietnam when JFK was assassinated. Within four years, LBJ had sent 400,000 troops there."</p></blockquote><p>Another notable conservative calling for an exit of Afghanistan is <em>Americans for Tax Reform</em> President Grover Norquist, who <em>Foreign Policy</em> magazine reports <a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/12/grover_norquist_calls_for_discussion_on_right_about_leaving_afghanistan" rel="noopener noreferrer">is hoping</a> "to build a center-right coalition to advocate for considering pulling out of Afghanistan in order to save the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars being spent there." Norquist invokes Ronald Reagan, who had to deal with terrorist attacks during his own presidency, but did not commit U.S. troops to open-ended occupations of foreign countries:</p><blockquote><p>"Reagan didn't decide that the U.S. should stay in Lebanon for 15 years. We left that country to have their civil war all by themselves."</p></blockquote><p>If a majority of Americans, from all across the political spectrum, support scaling down the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, what will it take for their leaders in Washington to listen?</p>
