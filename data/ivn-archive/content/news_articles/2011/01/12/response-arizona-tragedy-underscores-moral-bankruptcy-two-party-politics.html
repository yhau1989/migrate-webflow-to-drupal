Messamore</a> documented here yesterday, however, such wild accusations were both  premature and misplaced. &nbsp;Yet, that did not stop Republicans from joining  in on the game. &nbsp;Indeed, the immediate response on numerous  Republican-friendly websites was to insinuate a connection between the  assassin and the Democratic party. &nbsp;</p><p>A post at <a href="http://hillbuzz.org/2011/01/08/my-congresswoman-voted-against-nancy-pelosi-and-is-now-dead-to-me-eerie-daily-kos-hit-piece-on-gabrielle-giffords-just-two-days-before-assassination-attempt-on-her/" rel="noopener noreferrer">HillBuzz </a>asked,  “Is Daily Kos involved in Arizona murders?” writing:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Daily Kos,  DemocraticUnderground, and other George Soros-funded Leftist sites  routinely use turns of phrase that seem to encourage bodily harm towards  their political opponents. . . . It remains to be seen if the gunman  involved in today’s shooting of the Congresswoman and a dozen others is  directly connected to Daily Kos, but it would not be at all surprising  if he was.”&nbsp;</p><p>By Saturday evening, popular conservative Republican <a href="http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/police-surround-home-of-left-wing-shooter-jared-loughner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloggers such as Jim Hoft</a> had begun identifying the assassin as “left-wing shooter Jared  Loughner.” &nbsp;On Sunday, the founder of the Tea Party Nation, Judson  Phillips, wrote to supporters that:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The left is coming and will hit us  hard on this. We need to push back harder with the simple truth. The  shooter was a liberal lunatic. Emphasis on both words," according to a  report at <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/tea-party-group-blames-leftist-for-giffords-shooting/69153/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a>. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_011111/content/01125106.guest.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rush Limbaugh</a> has since gone so far as to assert that “Loughner knows he has the full  support of a major political party in this country . . . he knows that  the Democrat Party is attempting to find anybody but him to blame.”&nbsp; As <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/10/accused-gunman-had-no-party-affiliation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported</a> that Loughner was not in fact a Republican or Democrat, but was rather a registered Independent, Limbaugh went on to allege a connection between the assassin and the newly formed No Labels organization.&nbsp; He continued:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "all these moderates, great independents, who did they vote for in  November?&nbsp; Republicans, I think.&nbsp; And Mr. Loughner, if anything, he was  a No Labels guy. He himself was No Labels!&nbsp; He wasn't a Republican or  Democrat. He didn't like politics. He's made to order for the No Labels  group, and he's a murderer!"</p><p>The tit-for-tat accusations and assertions that have characterized the response to this tragedy are definitive of Democratic-Republican party politics. &nbsp;In an op-ed for the Sunday New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/opinion/10krugman.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Krugman</a> denounced the “climate of hate,” and the cascade of “toxic rhetoric . .  . coming overwhelmingly from the right.” &nbsp;The next day, on the other  side of the duopoly divide, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2011/01/10/the-progressive-climate-of-hate-an-illustrated-primer-2000-2010/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Malkin</a> denounced the “progressive climate of hate” with an “illustrated primer,” announcing, “They want to play tu quo que  in the middle of a national tragedy? They asked for it. They got it.”  &nbsp;</p><p>When did “I know you are but what am I?” become the primary mode of  political discourse in our country?&nbsp;</p><p>The debate, if we may dignify such exchanges with that term, reached a boiling point so quickly, CBS News <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20028105-503544.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">conducted a poll</a> on Sunday and Monday asking Americans whether the “harsh political  tone” and heated atmosphere of US politics had anything to do with the  Arizona shooting. &nbsp;Overall, a majority of Americans answered in the  negative, 57% to 32%. &nbsp;But the partisan divide between Republicans and  Democrats was apparent in the findings. &nbsp;Republicans overwhelmingly  rejected any connection between the tone of our national politics and  the shooting, 69% to 19%, while Democrats were more conflicted, with 49%  denying the connection and 42% affirming the existence of one. &nbsp;The  responses of Independents, on the other hand, more closely mirrored the  overall findings, with 56% answering in the negative and 33% affirming a  connection.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether  there is any such connection or not, the reactive, politicized response  to this tragedy appears to signal a qualitative change in the politics  of the two-party system, and it is not for the better. &nbsp;As Nick Gillespie angrily argued in an article  for <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2011/01/10/the-instant-politicization-of" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reason</a>:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The problem isn't with the current moment's rhetoric, it's with the  goddamn politicization of every goddamn thing not even for a higher  purpose or broader fight but for the cheapest moment-by-moment partisan  advantage.” &nbsp;</p><p>He concludes with a rhetorical question reflecting on the  rise in the numbers of Independent voters:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Faced with the way that the  major parties and their partisans try to bend every news story, trend,  box office hit or bomb, you name it, whether truly horrific (as  Saturday's shooting was) or totally banal, is it any wonder that fewer  people want to be affiliated with the Dems and Reps?”</p>
