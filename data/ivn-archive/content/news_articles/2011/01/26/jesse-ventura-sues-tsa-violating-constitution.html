We've allowed the  parties to take over the government.” &nbsp;Ironically, however, third party  advocates are among Ventura’s staunchest allies in opposing the TSA’s  invasive security procedures. &nbsp;As I <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/11/17/third-party-and-independent-activists-united-opposition-full-body-scanners-and-en" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported here</a> last November, Independent, Green, Libertarian, Pirate Party and  Constitution Party activists were united in their opposition to the  TSA’s new security protocols. &nbsp;Since then, even some Democrats and  Republicans have begun to voice concerns about the measures.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Electronic Privacy Information Center <a href="http://epic.org/events/tsa/" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted a conference</a> entitled “The Stripping of Freedom: A Careful Scan of TSA Security  Procedures.” &nbsp;Speakers at the event included Democratic Rep. Rush Holt,  former Green Party and Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, the Executive  Director of the Libertarian National Committee, Wes Benedict, as well as  representatives of advocacy groups and think tanks, security experts,  scholars and elected officials. &nbsp;In <a href="http://www.libertarianparty.com/blogs/staff/wes-benedicts-speech-at-tsa-full-body-scanner-conference" rel="noopener noreferrer">his remarks</a>,  Benedict stated:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When Libertarians and Ralph Nader agree a program is  bad...it's time for our government to listen,” adding, “I'm glad we have  a Congressman or two participating today. I wish more Republicans and  Democrats took our Constitution and Bill of Rights seriously.” &nbsp;</p><p>Indeed,  if they did, lawsuits such as Ventura’s might be unwarranted or  unnecessary to rein in the excesses of the executive branch.&nbsp;</p><p>A  number of lawsuits against the TSA are still pending and others have  been recently settled. &nbsp;The Electronic Privacy Information Center has  itself filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of full body scanners pending  an independent review. &nbsp;<a href="http://epic.org/privacy/body_scanners/epic_v_dhs_suspension_of_body.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their suit </a>claims  that the TSA program violates the Administrative Procedures Act, the  Privacy Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Video Voyeurism  Prevention Act, and the Fourth Amendment. &nbsp;</p><p>If today’s lawmakers are  looking to cut spending on wasteful and counterproductive government  programs, perhaps they need look no further. &nbsp;As <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/artcarden/2011/01/21/do-we-need-a-department-of-homeland-security-or-a-tsa/?boxes=opinionschannellatest" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art Carden</a> recently argued at Forbes:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The new Republican House of Representatives  took office amidst much fanfare about the US Constitution and  respecting Constitutional limits on government . . . if they are really  serious about it, they will start by abolishing the Transportation  Security Administration.”</p>
