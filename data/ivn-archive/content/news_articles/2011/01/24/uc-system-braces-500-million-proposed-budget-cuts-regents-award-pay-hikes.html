The chief financial officer of the hospital system at UCLA will receive a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F01%2F20%2FMN0O1HC6RT.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">10.5 percent raise</a>, bringing the salary up to $420,000.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F01%2F20%2FMN0O1HC6RT.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p><p> </p><p>The move was resoundly criticized by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees representing the low-wage UC employees (custodians, groundskeepers and patient care workers among others making less than $40,000), charging that these workers are facing layoffs as well as increased costs for their pensions, retirement contributions and health care costs.</p><p> </p><p>The approval of the increased compensation came just one day after UC President Mark Yudof told the regents that painful budget choices would have to be made over the next few months to close the UC system’s $1 billion budget gap. Layoffs, course reductions, and the shutting out some of the state’s most qualified students - a mover never before taken by the University system (UC accepts the top 12.5 percent of California high school graduates) - are on the table.</p><p> </p><p>As reported in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, Yudof said that:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be program closings, it may be layoffs. Each campus is in the process of figuring out where to cut. We are long past the time when we can just cut the fat."</p><p> </p><p>Earlier this month, Governor Jerry Brown proposed a <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/article/111491/brown_proposes_cuts_to_uc_csu_in_state_budget" rel="noopener noreferrer">$500 million cut</a> to the University of California’s public education system in an effort to close the state’s $24.5 billion deficit for 2011-2012. <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/article/111491/brown_proposes_cuts_to_uc_csu_in_state_budget" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>UC has already imposed <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2010/11/15/despite-more-funding-cal-state-increases-tuition-155-uc-seeking-another-8" rel="noopener noreferrer">double-digit</a> tuition increases on its students over the past few years and has been seeking out-of state students to help boost revenue.</p><p> </p><p>NOTE: Under the Governor’s plan, the California State University system will also face a $500 million cut, and the state's community college system is facing $432.5 million in cuts. K-12 education funding was spared for the time being.</p>
