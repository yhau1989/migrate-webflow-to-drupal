Gov. Jerry Brown has already hinted that he would support the notion of a California Dream Act.&nbsp; With the election of Brown, immigration reform activists are all the more motivated to carry out their grassroots efforts, especially demonstrated by the strong showing that the state's rapidly growing Hispanic population made in electing the recently sworn in governor against his Republican opponent Meg Whitman.&nbsp;</p><p>While the measure is yet another action on the immigration issue that puts California on the forefront of the matter, it additionally sets the stage for the state to have an immigration showdown at the polls between both sides in the the key 2012 election. This is because the more conservative side of the immigration argument will also make its presence felt.</p><p>The news site Packer.com <a href="http://thepacker.com/Arizona-style-immigration-law-could-hit-California-ballot/Article.aspx?oid=1296210&amp;fid=PACKER-TOP-STORIES&amp;aid=2189" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that Michael Erickson, of Minutemen fame and a recently elected official, is gathering signatures to put a law similar to the controversial Arizona immigration law on the 2012 ballot for California voters to decide. Billed the "Support Federal Immigration Law," it would require local police officers to check the legal status of illegal immigrants with probable cause and criminalize the intentional hire of illegal immigrants.</p>
