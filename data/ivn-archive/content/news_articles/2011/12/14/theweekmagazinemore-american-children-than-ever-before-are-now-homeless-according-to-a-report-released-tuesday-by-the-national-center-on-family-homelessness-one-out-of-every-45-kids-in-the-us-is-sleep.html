<blockquote>
<p>More American children than ever before are now homeless, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Center on Family Homelessness. <strong>One out of every 45 kids in the U.S. </strong>is sleeping on the streets, or lives in a shelter, motel, or home where struggling families are doubled up. <strong>Thatâ€™s 1.6 million kids in all. </strong><a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/222455/americas-bleak-child-homelessness-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer">What does this say about the effects of the Great Recession?</a></p>
