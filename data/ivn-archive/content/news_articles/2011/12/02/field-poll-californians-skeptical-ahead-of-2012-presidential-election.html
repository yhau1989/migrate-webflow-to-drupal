<p>A Field Poll released on Thursday reveals that Californians are frustrated with the current political process and have a bleak outlook for the country's future- even with a presidential election approaching in 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-5.00.01-PM.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="207" src="cloudinary://Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-5.00.01-PM.png" width="367"></a>In <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2397.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">assessing the sentiment of California's voters</a>, Field found that less than half - 45%- are inclined to have Barack Obama serve another term as President. At the same time, when matched up against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, President Obama leads among Californians by a margin of 50% to 40%. Paired against whom some hail at the moment&nbsp; as the leading contender- Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrinch- President Obama pulls ahead by a wider margin of 55% to 35% in general election trial heats.</p>

<p>Along with polling these potential head-to-head matchups, President Obama's job ratings in the state remain 'lackluster'. Only 48% approve of his current job performance while 44% disapprove. This is certainly better, however, than the average he's receiving nationally, with 44% approving and 51% disapproving.</p>

<p>Even with President Obama struggling somewhat in California, the current Republican frontrunner candidates are still behind.&nbsp; In what might be an indicator of how influential non-partisan voters could be in shaping the 2012 presidential race, Field's findings show how the state's non-partisan voters account for the meaningful difference in Romney-Obama and Gingrich-Obama matchups. Romney's somewhat stronger showing against Obama is attributed almost entirely to the general election preferences of California's non-partisan voters. Romney is statistically tied with Obama-42% to 41%-in this latest poll. On the other hand, in a head to head matchup with Gingrich, Obama gets a significantly larger share of non-partisan voters by a margin of 35 points.</p>

<p>What could be considered one of the most significant aspects of the poll is the way California voters feel about the direction of the country. Currently, 70% of the state believes the country is seriously off track.&nbsp; 43% of voters in the state don't believe that either reelecting Obama or electing the eventual Republican nominee will do much to remedy the country's economic problems. Only 27% of voters believe that relecting Obama will solve the nation's myriad problems, while only 25% believe that the GOP nominee will turn things around. This trend, if persistent, could arguably spell trouble for the two-party system in the future.&nbsp; 56% of non-partisans&nbsp; in the state are skeptical that next year's election will make a difference in impr0ving the economy.</p>

<p>This latest Field Poll was conducted Nov. 15-27 with a sample&nbsp; of 1,000 registered California voters. The margin of error is +/- 3.1%. Questions asked to a random subsample of voters, such as the head to head matchups with President Obama among others, had a margin of error of 4.5%.</p>
