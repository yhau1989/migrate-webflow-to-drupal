<p>The approval ratings of the federal government, and of Congress in particular, remain at an abysmal low.&nbsp; A CBS News <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/Poll_Obama_120911.pdf?tag=contentMain;contentBody" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> (.pdf) released on Friday found that just 11% of Americans approve of the way the Congress is handling its job while 82% disapprove.&nbsp; This broad majority represents a veritable national consensus across all partisan lines.&nbsp; Among those polled, 77% of Democrats, 81% of Republicans, and 87% of Independents expressed disapproval of the current Congress.</p>

<p>Ironically, the 11% approval rating actually represents a step up.&nbsp; It is 2% higher than the all-time low of 9% recorded by CBS last month.&nbsp; Editorial boards are alarmed by the numbers.</p>
<blockquote>"Survey after survey in recent months has shown an alarming decline in public confidence in the nation's chief federal institutions, as well as a deepening pessimism about America's future. Congressional approval is at an all-time low of 13 percent, according to the Gallup Poll, and three-quarters of the public wouldn't re-elect most members of Congress," opined<a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/2011/12/why-americans-no-longer-trust-washington/1990061" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Washington Examiner</a> over the weekend.</blockquote>
<p>The Examiner editorial does not mention, however, that though the approval rating of Congress as a whole barely crosses into the double digits, a majority of Americans nonetheless state that their own Congressional representative deserves re-election.&nbsp; A Gallup <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/151433/Record-High-Anti-Incumbent-Sentiment-Toward-Congress.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> released on Friday proclaimed that the survey group had found "record high anti-incumbent sentiment toward Congress."&nbsp; The situation certainly sounds dire.&nbsp; 76% of registered voters told the pollster that most members of Congress do not deserve re-election, the highest such percentage the organization has found in nearly two decades of surveys.&nbsp; The previous high of 70% was recorded in August.&nbsp; And, once again, the national consensus spans all partisan lines.&nbsp; 68% of Democrats, 75% of Republicans and 82% of Independents told Gallup that most members of Congress do not deserve re-election.</p>

<p>The situation is quite different, however, when one inquires about registered voters' views toward their own representatives.&nbsp; In the very same poll, Gallup found that 53% of registered voters believe their own representative in the US House deserves to be re-elected, compared with just 39% who said the opposite.&nbsp; Historically, Americans tend to have more positive views about their own representatives than of Congress as a whole.&nbsp; The 53% majority who believe their own representative deserves re-election is just 5% higher than the survey's record low of 48% on this particular question in 1992.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, so long as Americans continue to turn a blind eye toward the deficiencies of their own representatives, we will all continue to suffer from inadequate representation in government.&nbsp; When we cast our ballots, after all, we do not vote on Congress as a whole, but rather for our own individual delegate.&nbsp; If we are going to clean house, we have to begin at home.&nbsp; If you desire to "throw the bums out," as the old saying goes, you must first stop voting them in.</p>
