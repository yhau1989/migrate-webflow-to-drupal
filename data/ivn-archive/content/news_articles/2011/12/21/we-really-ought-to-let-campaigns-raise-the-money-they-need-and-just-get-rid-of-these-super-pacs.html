<p>We really ought to let campaigns raise the money they need and just get rid of these super PACs.<br></p><p>GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/20/mitt-romney-super-pacs-restore-our-future_n_1160643.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to distance himself</a> from a super PAC founded by his former aides to support his bid for the GOP nomination.</p>
<p>Romney has spoken at the same group’s fundraising events. Six months prior, his spokeswoman <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/05/news/la-pn-romney-fundraising-20110705" rel="noopener noreferrer">said of the group</a>: “We are pleased that independent groups will be active in fighting this entrenched power so the country can get back to work.”</p>
