In the poll, she leads Huey by 52%- 44%. Still undecided is a small but potentially influential 4%. Throw in a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9% and Huey's proximity to Hahn could be a lot closer than expected.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where Independent voters can play a significant role in influencing an election that came as a result of the newly implemented top-two open primary system. Human Events conservative political reporter John Gizzi has <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=44707" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that while Democrats outnumber Republicans by 45%-27% district wide, another 20% of registered voters in the district are registered as "Decline to State." In essence, Independents could make up a sizable chunk of the winning candidate's share of votes.</p><p>California voters as a whole have traditionally been faithful to liberal candidates, and with the South Bay's constituents leaning Democrat by a double digit margin over Republican, Hahn has pulled in the big whigs like former president Bill Clinton to help fundraise.&nbsp; However, if Independents pull for Huey in the end, then this very contest could be viewed as a vote against the political establishment. Even with President Clinton endorsing Hahn, it is a bit surprising that the race is as close as it is at this point.&nbsp;Gizzi has noted that the 36th district has ordinarily been very blue, having voted for now President Barack Obama by a 30 point margin and for candidate John Kerry by 20 points.</p><p>The Daily Kos, which initially commissioned the Public Policy Polling data, is banking on election day turnout to favor Hahn and propel her to victory. In its <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/07/11/993391/-CA-36:-Janice-Hahn-%28D%29-leads-by-8-for-tomorrows-special-election?detail=hide" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> citing poll data, however, the liberal blog seems to conveniently gloss over the fact that Independent voters favor Huey over Hahn by 50%-40%. Ten percent of Independents polled for today's race are still undecided.&nbsp;</p><p>The Public Policy Poll's sample included 619 likely voters and was conducted July 8, 2011- July 10, 2011.</p>
