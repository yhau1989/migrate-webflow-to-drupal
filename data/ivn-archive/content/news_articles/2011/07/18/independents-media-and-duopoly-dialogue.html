Much the same can be said of the  political press in general. &nbsp;</p><p>If you can reasonably predict the  semi-scripted talking points that will be regurgitated by the token  representatives of the major parties, and are virtually certain that no  other point of view will be included in the discussion, one could easily  be forgiven for choosing to spend one’s time in pursuit of other  interests.&nbsp;</p><p>There  is a very simple reason why Republicans watch Fox News and Democrats  favor MSNBC. &nbsp;Those outlets represent and articulate their viewpoints  and concerns. &nbsp;But where are Independents to turn if they are flipping  through the channels looking for someone who effectively speaks for  them, who gives voice to their thoughts and ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Though  there are more Americans who refuse to identify with the Democratic or  Republican party than there are Democrats or Republicans, as numerous  surveys and polls have found, our national discourse is dominated by the  factionalists of the major parties. &nbsp;Is it any wonder Independents are  more likely to tune out than tune in?&nbsp;</p>
