Bush and lobbied for by the lighting industry and the big box stores such as Lowe’s and Home Depot, which sell the greatest number of CFL bulbs.&nbsp; The fiercest opposition today comes from Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and the Tea Party, both of which resent overbearing governmental intrusion into private life.</p><p>But perhaps more cogent than any other argument is the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2011/07/14/3768457/letters-to-the-editor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a> made by Louise Mehler of Sacramento on the letters page&nbsp; of the July 14 Sacramento Bee:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ve searched diligently, in stores and online, but have yet to find a source for energy-efficient bulbs manufactured anywhere other than in China.”</p><p>Thomas A. Edison, one of America’s genius inventors and entrepreneurs, and creator of the incandescent light bulb, surely would be disappointed that we have been unable to manufacture high quantities of CFLs in the United States, to employ our own citizens in that process and to equip the world with this energy-efficient product.&nbsp;</p><p>As Americans, we should always have choices.&nbsp; And among those choices should be the ability to buy American-made products.&nbsp;</p>
