What's interesting to note in the Pew Study is that even Democratic-leaning independents, a good number of which would probably reside in California according to recent figures, are also having mixed feelings about the President on this issue. The 48% who approve narrowly edge out the 43% of Democratic-leaning independents who disapprove. Overall, 45% of independents believe that the GOP can better trim the deficit versus 29% who don't.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the Pew Study is that independents are more on par in agreeing with Republicans in having a gloomy view that the economy is poor. Up from 43% in February, 57% of the independent demographic believe that current economic conditions are poor. A similar trend exists among Republicans, with 59% sharing a similar sentiment. Meanwhile, not as many Democrats share the view that the economy offers a gloomy outlook.&nbsp;Although more Democrats believe that economic conditions are poor compared to February's numbers, the Pew Study demonstrates that this change is smaller than their Republican and independent counterparts (41% poor now, up from 36% in February).&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, differing from Democrats, Republicans and independents share the view that economic recovery will take longer. The study says that 59% of independents and 63% of Republicans believe this to be the case. Meanwhile, 41% of Democrats share this view. What's common in this area of concern is that, unlike the other questions regarding the economy, this query saw a significant jump from all three groups. In February, 44% of independents, 49% of Republicans, and 32% of Democrats shared this view.</p><p>Where independents break from Republicans is in the outlook of family finances. While 36% of Republicans currently expect things to get worse in this area, the Pew Study noted that there was no significant change among independents when presented with this issue. 48% of Republicans and 45% of independents do, however, say that their household finances are affected by the budget deficit.</p><p>Here in California, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CBoQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.caivn.org%2Farticle%2F2011%2F03%2F23%2Findependents-outnumber-republicans-among-californias-latino-voters&amp;ei=IPqjTaOgIoiCsQPV7PX5DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4SRP2Vp8Mu0CE4atLvMXJcwHErA&amp;sig2=uoi8VLLh4zL5hUMOSQNYzg" rel="noopener noreferrer">where independents are outgrowing Republicans among Latinos</a>, President Obama is facing a lower approval rating than he has enjoyed in the state in times past. The Los Angeles Times <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2010/03/obamas-approval-rating-falls-in-california.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> that California has been a reliably Democratic state in presidential politics since 1992; however, his approval rating in the state has fallen by 13 points to 52% from 65% within the last year. &nbsp;</p>
