The  findings have media outlets asking “Whatever happened to the  antiwar movement?” even as thousands of Americans took to the streets in  cities across the country earlier this month to protest the wars in  Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.</p><p>The new paper, published in the journal <em>Mobilization</em> by Michael Heaney and Fabio Rojas, analyzes what the authors call “the  demobilization of the antiwar movement in the United States” between  2007 and 2009. &nbsp;Based on interviews with over 5,000 demonstrators at  nearly 30 major antiwar protests across the country over that two year  period, the researchers conclude that the electoral success of the  Democratic party in the elections of 2006 and 2008 led to the large-scale abandonment of the antiwar movement by Democrats, even despite the  party’s failure to deliver on its antiwar promises. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Activists  identified with the Democratic Party were disproportionately likely to  leave the movement as time went on, as they considered Democratic  electoral success to be concomitant with the achievement of their policy  aims,” they write. &nbsp;</p><p>In  their interviews and surveys, the researchers tracked the partisan  composition of the protests they attended. &nbsp;In 2007 and 2008,  participation by self-identified Democrats fluctuated between 37% and  54%, and then plunged to a low of 19% in late 2009. &nbsp;Over the same  period, participation by third party supporters and Independents who  professed no party affiliation fluctuated between 46%, when Democratic  turnout was at its high, and over 85%, as Democratic turnout reached  its nadir. &nbsp;</p><p>The report concludes that, “the withdrawal of Democrats from  the movement in 2009 appears to be a significant explanation for the  falling size of antiwar protests.” &nbsp;The research team’s surveyors  estimated that hundreds of thousands of individuals turned out for  antiwar protests in early 2007 and dwindled to the hundreds by late  2009. &nbsp;</p><p>The  report’s findings have prompted a number of mainstream media outlets to  ask: “Whatever happened to the antiwar movement?” &nbsp;On April 15th, both  NPR and the Wall Street Journal published articles posing that exact  question. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/15/135391188/whatever-happened-to-the-anti-war-movement" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece at NPR</a> noted that, “Now and then, small pockets of protesters still band together,” while the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/04/15/what-happened-to-the-anti-war-movement/?mod=google_news_blog" rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ</a> report stated that antiwar protests remain at about the levels common  in late 2009, “drawing mere hundreds.”&nbsp;</p><p>Remarkably, neither of these  articles mentioned the fact that on the <em>previous weekend</em>, thousands of Americans had gathered in New York and San Francisco to protest the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Libya.&nbsp; As it turns out, the protests were widely ignored in the mainstream media. &nbsp;A <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/592/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=6545" rel="noopener noreferrer">report </a>by  the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting drew  attention to the dearth of coverage and called on news media to “stop  blacking out progressive protests,” writing: “The antiwar protest had  thousands of attendees--and received almost zero corporate media  coverage.” &nbsp;</p><p>Neither NPR nor the Wall Street Journal appear to have reported that  upwards of 10,000 anti-war protesters gathered in New York City on April  9th, and that thousands more converged in San Francisco the next day,  even though these were likely the largest antiwar demonstrations in the  country since 2008. &nbsp;Coverage of the protests was almost entirely  confined to local media outlets, third party news sources and blogs. &nbsp;</p><p>The  protests in New York and San Francisco, along with smaller gatherings in other cities, were organized by the United  National Antiwar Committee, a relatively new antiwar umbrella  organization founded in the summer of 2010.&nbsp; It consists of a diverse  coalition of antiwar and peace groups as well as Independent and third  party political organizations. &nbsp;Among the featured speakers at the protest in San  Francisco’s Delores Park was Malalai Joya, an antiwar and women’s rights  activist who was driven from her seat in Afghanistan’s parliament  because of her opposition to both the US occupation and local warlords,  according to a <a href="http://socialistworker.org/2011/04/11/protesting-war-and-austerity" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> at the Socialist Worker. &nbsp;</p><p>Numerous  third party leaders spoke at the events in New York City. &nbsp;Among them  were Howie Hawkins, a former Green Party nominee for governor, Charles  Barron, a local elected official and leader of the Freedom Party, and  prominent antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan, who waged an unsuccessful bid  for Congress as an Independent against Nancy Pelosi in 2008, coming in  second in the race with just over 16% of the vote. &nbsp;Sheehan pulled no  punches in her remarks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “People  say there’s only two things guaranteed in life: death and taxes. I can  guarantee you three more things: if you vote for a Democrat or a  Republican, you’re voting for more war, you’re voting for more economic  oppression, and you’re voting for more environmental devastation,” she  said to the assembled crowd in the heart of New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>Reportedly,  the United National Antiwar Committee is now working to build on the  momentum created in New York and San Francisco, and is coordinating with  immigrant and workers rights groups to stage a new round of protests  across the country on May 1st. &nbsp;Maybe the mainstream media will take  note.</p>
