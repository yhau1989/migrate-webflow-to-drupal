<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/100814_independent_party.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://100814_independent_party.jpg" title="Emergency measure would outlaw Independent Party of Oregon" width="300"></a></p><p>As  the Independent movement gains strength and momentum, it is only  logical to expect a backlash from the partisans in the major parties. &nbsp;In Oregon, Independents are fighting for the  very right to represent themselves as Independents.&nbsp;</p><p>Today,  the Rules Committee of the Oregon state House is scheduled to consider a  bill – HB 2442 – that would force the Independent Party of Oregon to  change its name or face dissolution. &nbsp;More precisely, the proposal would  prohibit any party from using the word ‘Independent’ in its name on the  basis of the assertion that such use of the word “independent” causes  confusion among voters and even threatens the integrity of the elections  process. &nbsp;Absurdly, the bill goes so far as to declare a state of  emergency regarding the matter, claiming that it is “necessary for the  immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety,”  according to the <a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/11reg/measpdf/hb2400.dir/hb2442.intro.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">official summary</a> (.pdf) available at the state legislature’s website.&nbsp;</p><p>The  Independent Party of Oregon is the third largest party in the state.  &nbsp;Founded in 2006, the party already has more members than all other  third party organizations in the state combined, with over 65,000  registered voters. &nbsp;The proposed bill apparently seeks to address the  possibility that voters who do not intend to affiliate with any party  might inadvertently inflate membership in the Independent Party by  registering “Independent” rather than non-affiliated.&nbsp;</p><p>While  leaders of the Independent Party of Oregon do not dispute the fact that  such a misunderstanding is possible, it hardly merits a declaration of  emergency. &nbsp;Just 3% of voters in the state are registered with the  Independent Party, compared with over 20% who are registered as  non-affiliated, 32% who are registered Republican and 41.5% registered  Democrat, according to the most recent <a href="http://www.sos.state.or.us/elections/pages/history/stats/11mvr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistics</a> from the Oregon Secretary of State’s office.</p><p>At  the time of this writing, it remains unknown who the sponsor or  sponsors of the bill in the Oregon legislature are. &nbsp;It was introduced  anonymously by the House Interim Committee on Rules. &nbsp;Co-chair of the  House Rules Committee, State Rep. Andy Olson, professed ignorance on the  matter. &nbsp;“No one seems to be able to own it,” he told the <a href="http://www.democratherald.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_e3d63cce-64cb-11e0-bee0-001cc4c03286.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat Herald</a> newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless  to say, members of the Independent Party of Oregon are outraged at the  measure, as are all Americans who value the First Amendment should be. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The  free speech and free association implications of this bill are  stunning, particularly when you consider that no legislator has listed  his or her name as a sponsor,” said Party Chair, Linda Williams in a  statement on the measure at the party’s website. “This is a transparent  partisan attempt by a handful of legislators to strangle the Independent  Party of Oregon in its infancy," she continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 400 supporters of the party have already signed a <a href="http://www.indparty.com/survey/responses5.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">petition</a> in opposition to any effort to restrict the rights to free speech and  association of the members of the Independent Party of Oregon. &nbsp;In one  of the more polite comments appended to the petition, Jule Johnson of  Brookings, writes:</p><blockquote><p>“I have been a Democrat and then a Republican and I am  now proudly a member of the Independent Party. I have never in my years  as a voter been more disgusted with the way either of the major parties  have dealt with all of the important issues facing our wonderful  country and our beautiful state.” &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The proposed bill is unprecedented in US history. &nbsp;Ballot access expert <a href="http://www.ballot-access.org/2011/04/11/oregon-legislative-hearing-set-on-bill-to-ban-independent-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Winger</a> writes that “no state has ever passed a law telling a party that was  already ballot-qualified that it had to change its name.”&nbsp;</p><p>The bill has been <a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/11reg/agenda/webagendas.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduled</a> to have its first public hearing at the meeting of the Oregon House  Rules Committee today at 3pm with committee co-chair, and Democratic  party leader, Rep. Dave Hunt presiding. &nbsp;The leadership of the  Independent Party suspects that Hunt is responsible for the bill,  according to the <a href="http://www.democratherald.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_e3d63cce-64cb-11e0-bee0-001cc4c03286.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat Herald</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
