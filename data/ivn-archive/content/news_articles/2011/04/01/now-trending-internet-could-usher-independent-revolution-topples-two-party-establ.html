Furthermore, tools like social media (when used correctly) are not only more cost-effective than buying television ads, they also encourage a productive two-way conversation between candidates and their constituents. With social media, candidates are actually forced to communicate&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;instead of selling their talking points like products needing to be purchased in late-night television informercials.</p><p>Even as Republicans have sought to catch up with the new media monster machine of President Barack Obama, what they and their Democratic colleagues are forgetting is that the battle on the internet for the hearts and minds of voters isn't confined to the elite Washington Establishment.</p><p>Being a truly democratic environment open to anyone and everyone, the internet is a ripe place for a Cinderella third party candidate to seize the day and authentically engage disenchanted voters. With the public's approval of Congress remaining low both before and after the Republican takeover, as well as relatively low approval ratings for President Obama, an independent candidate could prove viable if he plays his cards right.</p><p>Aided by the fluid medium of the internet, the impending doom of the two-party system might just arrive sooner rather than later. In fact, Gerald Celente, founder and director of the Trends Research Institute, has predicted that in 2012 a legitimate third party candidate is likely to challenge Obama and the Republican nominee. As my colleague Ryan Jaroncyk <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2009/12/31/2nd-american-revolution-its-way" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> back in 2009:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Celente posits that the development of a robust third party will serve as the culmination of the next American Revolution, a largely intellectual revolution that will revive the spirit and mind of the American people. 2012 will commence the American Renaissance, as the nation exits the era of corporatism, perpetual war, government secrecy, and gargantuan debt, and returns to its 1776 roots of constitutional government, individual liberties, limited war, innovation, states' rights, and fiscal responsibility."</p><p>And much like Trippi, Celente is calling this potential third party challenger the "<a href="http://wn.com/Gerald_Celente_Forecast_for_Third_Party_Internet_Candidate_for_2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Candidate</a>".&nbsp;</p><p>With the internet at their disposal, along with Trippi's and Celente's bold predictions, the future seems bright for truly independent-minded voters looking to break the chains of the two-party system.</p>
