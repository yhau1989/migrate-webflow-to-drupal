The city has plenty of leeway to add pollution to its sparkling clean air versus other potential sites that have already spoiled their air.&nbsp; So it's logical to spread around the bad air to Kings Beach, which can afford more deterioration before it violates clean air standards.</p><p>The biomass plant is far from a done deal -- in fact, the environmental impact statement is still in the preparation stages, and there are numerous planned meetings of concerned citizens in Kings Beach and surrounding communities.&nbsp; (A copy of the Notice of Preparation can be downloaded <a href="http://www.placer.ca.gov/planning" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).The question is whether a working-class community like Kings Beach, in the midst of Lake Tahoe's abundance, will be able to mount an effective protest with credible alternatives to the current plan -- and whether anyone will listen.</p>
