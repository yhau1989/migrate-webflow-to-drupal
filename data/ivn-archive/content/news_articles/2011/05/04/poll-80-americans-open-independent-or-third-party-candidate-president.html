Asked by the  polling organization if they would consider voting for an Independent or  third party candidate for president in 2012, 60% of respondents answered "yes," an additional 20% said they might consider doing so, and  just 17% said they would not. &nbsp;Those who answered affirmatively included  89% of Independents, 83% of Tea Party supporters, 86% of Republicans,  and even 71% of Democrats!&nbsp;</p><p>If  these results are not simply a statistical fluke, they indicate an  increasing openness on the part of the American public to consider political  alternatives to the Democratic and Republican parties. &nbsp;A <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/12/wsjnbc-poll-does-the-two-party-system-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ/NBC poll</a> from May 2010 found that 31% of Americans – a record high at the time –  agreed with the statement that the two-party system is broken and a  third party would be good for the country. &nbsp;A <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/143051/Americans-Renew-Call-Third-Party.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All+Gallup+Headlines+-+Politics" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll</a> from September 2010 reported that 58% of Americans thought the  Democratic and Republican parties do such a poor job of representing the  American people that a major third party is necessary.</p><p>Though  it is rarely addressed publicly by Democrats and Republicans, such  discontent has not gone unnoticed among political observers. &nbsp;In a  column for The Daily Beast from this past March, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-04/bring-on-a-third-party-for-the-2012-presidential-election/2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas Shoen</a> considered the clear and present desire among the American public for  third party and Independent alternatives to the Democrats and  Republicans.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The American people are hungry for a third-party  candidate for president, be it a moderate insider or an outsider with a  proven record of experience from the business community or the  military,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Americans  remain deeply dissatisfied with government of, by and for the  Republican and Democratic parties. &nbsp;According to the Reason Foundation  survey, there are more Americans who do not trust Democrats or  Republicans to govern in a responsible manner than there are who trust  either party to do so. &nbsp;35% of respondents said that they do not trust  either major party to govern responsibly, including 85% of Independents,  35% of Republicans and 25% of Democrats. &nbsp;Just 30.5% were willing to  admit they trust the Democrats and only 23% stated they trust the GOP.&nbsp;</p><p>The  partisan breakdown of the survey’s respondents roughly corresponds with  the aggregate national party identification numbers from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/30/party-id_n_725948.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pollster.com</a>,  which averages the results from a wide swath of surveys. &nbsp;Among those  queried for the Reason poll, 38% were Democrats, 30.5% were Republicans  and 24% were Independents. &nbsp;It appears likely, however, that  Independents were somewhat under-represented in the survey’s sample.  &nbsp;According to Pollster.com, 38.5% of all adults are Independents, 31%  are Democrats and 23% are Republicans, while among registered and likely  voters 39% are Democrats, 34% are Republican and 28% are Independent.&nbsp;</p><p>Prodded  by Reason’s polling organization as to whether they are “closer to” the  Republican or Democratic party, 41% of Independents stated that they  lean toward neither, while 30% stated they are closer to the GOP and 23%  said they are closer to the Democrats. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the pollster did  not inquire whether self-identified Republicans and Democrats actually  lean more toward political independence or a third party such as the  Libertarians or Greens than toward the party with which they nominally  affiliate themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideologically  speaking, a plurality of &nbsp;Independents identified themselves as  moderates (35%), but they are twice as likely to identify their overall  political philosophy as conservative (25%) rather than liberal (12%).  &nbsp;Interestingly, comparable numbers of Independents consider themselves  to be libertarians (6%) and progressives (6%). &nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly,  political Independents are also the most likely of any partisan group  to state that they belong to no religion. Asked for their religious  preference, 24% of Independents stated that they have “no religion,”  compared with 17% of Democrats and 9.5% of Republicans. &nbsp;25% of  Independents said that they never attend religious services, compared  with 16% of Democrats and 10% of Republicans.&nbsp;</p><p>The  Reason survey, the first in a series of polls that will be conducted by  the organization, provides a detailed look at the views of Americans on  everything from the national debt and taxation, to public sector  employee pay and benefits, collective bargaining rights, and drug  policy. &nbsp;In addition, it queried respondents as to their positions on  government involvement in health care, financial services,  communications, energy, education and transportation among other things.  All of the<a href="http://reason.com/poll/2011/05/03/cut-debt-poll-finds" rel="noopener noreferrer"> survey’s findings</a>, including the top-line results and cross-tab report are available in full online. &nbsp;</p>
