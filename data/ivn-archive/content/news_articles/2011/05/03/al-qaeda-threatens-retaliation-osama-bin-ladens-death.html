In 2005, the Bush Administration disclosed the details of an Al-Qaeda plot to crash a hijacked plane into the U.S. Bank Tower (formerly known as the Library Tower) in Los Angeles.</p><p>In a poll published online Monday, <em>CNBC</em> asked participants if they felt safer as a result of Osama bin Laden's confirmed death at the hands of a U.S. special operations team. Late Monday night, with over 10,000 participants in the unscientific Internet poll, a scant 28% of respondents said the news of bin Laden's death made them feel safer, while an astonishing 72% said that the news did not make them feel safer.</p><p>Public officials, including CIA Director Leon Panetta, are warning that an attempt by Al-Qaeda to avenge Osama bin Laden's death is almost certain, and encouraging citizens to remain alert and vigilant, even as U.S. intelligence and defense step up security measures to keep Americans safe.&nbsp; While it is extremely prudent to remain careful and vigilant, it is also important for Americans to live their lives free from the terror that groups like Al-Qaeda hope to elicit. When California was on alert for terrorist attacks in 2002, Governor Gray Davis had these wise words to offer in an interview with <em>CNN</em>: "I just want Californians to go on with their lives."</p>
