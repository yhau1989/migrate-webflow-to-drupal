Eight of the 10 moderates lost  their seats in November.” &nbsp;</p><p>If, on the contrary, Independents would  rather see Independent lawmakers sticking to their positions, they’re  going to have to elect them first.</p><p>To read the polls in their entirety, see: <a href="http://people-press.org/report/711/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704005404576176981643217882.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ/NBC News</a>, and the <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1563" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quinnipiac Polling Institute</a>.</p>
