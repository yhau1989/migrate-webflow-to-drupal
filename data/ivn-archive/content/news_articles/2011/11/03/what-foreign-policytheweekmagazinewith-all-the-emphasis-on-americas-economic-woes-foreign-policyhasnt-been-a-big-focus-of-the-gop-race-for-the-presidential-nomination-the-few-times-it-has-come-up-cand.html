<p>With all the emphasis on America’s economic woes, foreign policy&nbsp;hasn’t been a big focus of the GOP race for the presidential nomination. The few times it has come up, <strong>candidates have made headlines for their errors</strong> not their insights. Here, some (but certainly not all) of <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/221059/2012-gop-race-6-biggest-foreign-policy-gaffes" rel="noopener noreferrer">the glaring foreign policy gaffes from the race so far:</a></p>
<ul><li><strong>Herman Cain implies China doesn’t have nukes</strong><em><br>Gaffe:</em>&nbsp;”My China strategy is quite simply outgrow China. … Yes, they’re a military threat. They’ve indicated that they’re trying to develop nuclear capability and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Rick Perry suggests invading Mexico</strong><em><br>Gaffe:</em>&nbsp;”It may require our military, in Mexico, working in concert with them, to kill these drug cartels and to keep them off our border and to destroy their networks.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Rick Santorum hopes for war with China</strong><em><br>Gaffe:</em>&nbsp;”You know, Mitt, I don’t want to go to a trade war, I want to beat China. I want to go to war with China and make America the most attractive place in the world to do business.”</li>
