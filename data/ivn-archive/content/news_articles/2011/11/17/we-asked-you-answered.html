<p><strong><em>We Asked, You Answered!</em> is the first of a series of weekly polls. We want to hear from you! What does the term independent voter mean to you?</strong></p>
<p><em>The results are in! And among the diverse set of answers we received, it seems one thing’s for sure: independent voters cannot be labeled. Some lean to the left, some to the right, but either way, independent voters are a group of independently minded, diverse, politically active citizens. Here’s what some people had to say:&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul><li>
<blockquote>I like being registered as an Independent Voter. Even though I am “left leaning” I identify strongly with neither political party. I believe there is room for liberal, conservative and progressive thought and solutions to our country’s problems. -Ann Marie McDaniel</blockquote>
    </li>
</ul><ul><li>
<blockquote>It means neither party can just take my vote for granted…I’ll vote policies rather than party line…they have to earn my vote! -Deb Murata&nbsp;</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<blockquote>Someone who votes for a candidate based on that candidates responses to important issues, rather than based on their party affiliation. -anonymous</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<blockquote>One who doesn’t agree 100% w D’s or R’s and can choose that both parties (or in some cases none) have valid points. -anonymous&nbsp;</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<blockquote>Easy. I use my “independent” brain to vote on different issues/candidate. I DO NOT toe the party line! -Lynn Milner Walker&nbsp;</blockquote>
