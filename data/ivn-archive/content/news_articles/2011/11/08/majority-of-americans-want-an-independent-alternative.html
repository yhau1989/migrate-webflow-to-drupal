<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/independent-voters.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://independent-voters.jpg" title="independent-voters"></a>Dissatisfaction with the Republican and Democratic parties has many Americans considering the prospect of an Independent alternative.&nbsp; A new survey by ABC News and The Washington Post finds that 61% of Americans favor the idea of an Independent candidate for president.</p>

<p>Released last Wednesday, the poll asked respondents whether they favor the idea of an Independent candidate running for president against the Democratic and Republican party nominees.&nbsp; There was broad support for the proposition.&nbsp; Overall, 61% of those polled said they favored the idea, with 25% stating that they strongly favor it, and 36% saying they find it somewhat favorable.</p>

<p>There is broad support for the idea across partisan lines.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, Independents were most supportive of the prospect.&nbsp; 73% of Independents said they favor the idea, with 37% stating that they strongly favor it.&nbsp; Outright majorities of Democrats and Republicans also expressed a favorable attitude toward an Independent candidate for president.&nbsp; 57% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats said they favor the notion.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there was less divergence in the level of support for an Independent candidate for president across ideological categories than across the partisan spectrum.&nbsp; 64% of moderates, 61% of liberals, 60% of those who identified themselves as somewhat conservative, and 59% of those who identified themselves as very conservative said they favor the idea.</p>

<p>In terms of partisan identification, Independents remain the largest segment of the electorate.</p>

<p>"They've outnumbered Democrats and Republicans in ABC/Post polls steadily since 2009, by far the longest period in which they've done so in polling back to 1981," wrote Gary Langer in the analysis accompanying the poll release.</p>

<p>Though most Independents do not have a favorable view of the Republican or Democratic parties, they dislike the GOP even more than they dislike the Democrats.&nbsp; 40% of Independents in the survey stated they have a favorable view of the Democratic party, while 49% said they have an unfavorable view.&nbsp; Just 34% said they have a favorable impression of the Republican party, while 54% said they view the Republican party unfavorably.</p>

<p>Overall, respondents to the survey do not have a favorable impression of either major party, though they were more closely divided in their views of the Democrats than of the Republicans.&nbsp; 48% said they have a favorable impression of the Democrats while 46% said they have an unfavorable view of the president's party.&nbsp; Looking toward the other side of the proverbial aisle, 40% said they have a favorable impression of the GOP, while 53% said they have an unfavorable view of the majority party in the House.</p>

<p>These ratings represent an historic low for the Democrats.</p>

<p>"The Democratic Party's rating is its lowest in polls since November 1984, days before Ronald Reagan's landslide re-election, when it hit 47 percent favorable.&nbsp; The Republican Party is better off than its historic low in popularity (31 percent in 1998, upon the impeachment of Bill Clinton) but still 8 points below the Democrats," noted the poll analysis.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postabcpoll_103011.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The poll&nbsp;</a>was conducted by phone from October 26th-30th and queried a random sample of 1003 adults nationwide.&nbsp; It has a margin of error of 3.5 points.</p>
