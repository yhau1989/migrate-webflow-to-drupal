<blockquote>
<p>Harold and Kumar go to Zuccotti Park:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filmgoers who’ve turned out to see “A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3-D Christmas” since it came out last weekend may have been struck by some unusually timely scenes.</p>
<p>Right at the front of the movie, John Cho’s Harold, who works in the New York financial world, can be seen in his office near a Wall Street protest. He’s then accosted by the protesters, who hurl names (and worse) at him after his assistant provokes them. (Harold holds his tongue — he’s one of those good-guy one-percenters.)</p>
<p>Um, how did a movie shot in the summer of 2010 anticipate a movement that began <a href="http://lat.ms/tMquDc" rel="noopener noreferrer">only in September</a>?</p>
