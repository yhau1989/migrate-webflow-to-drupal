<p>The Fourth Amendent of the U.S. Constitution says:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. Appeals Court Judge Douglas Ginsburg says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A person who knows all of another’s travels can deduce whether he is a weekly church goer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individuals or political groups — and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States. So if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 1984 from their brief.”</p>
</blockquote>
