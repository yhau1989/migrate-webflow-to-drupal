<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/we_are_anonymous_by_anonops-d3f9mgj1.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="187" src="cloudinary://we_are_anonymous_by_anonops-d3f9mgj1-300x187.jpg" width="300"></a>For over seven weeks the world has watched the Occupy movement with varying degrees of interest. The movement has appeared on every continent and one of its most visible protests is happening in Oakland, CA. In order to predict what will be happening here and to understand the global implications of the movement we need to take a look at other hot spots around the globe.</p>

<p>Of particular importance is the recent union between Occupy and Anonymous, a hacking group promoting internet freedom. &nbsp;The two have crossed paths before and this weekend they will be joining forces on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>On 11-11-11 Anonymous will be joining in solidarity with the Occupy movement marching on London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral. Anonymous followers will be donning Guy Fawkes masks, aware observers should recognize the similarity between the march and the closing scene of V for Vendetta, where thousands of individuals march on Parliament dressed in black cloaks and Guy Fawkes masks.</p>

<p>Anonymous appears and disappears in waves leading up to and following major activist events around the world. How their involvement on Friday night affects the Occupy protests is anyone’s guess. Considering the estimated 10,000 students in London protesting education cuts&nbsp;on Wednesday, aside from Occupy and several other protests, the high tension in London is likely to magnify the event being promoted by Anonymous.</p>

<p>Anonymous has flexed plenty of muscle in the past in its hacking activities with&nbsp;<a href="http://uk.ibtimes.com/articles/187771/20110727/anonymous-lulzsec-target-paypal-ebay-stock-value-hackers-hack-attack-antisec-arrest-fbi-arrests.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">major offline implications.</a>&nbsp;These protests paired with Anonymous’ recent advocacy on behalf of National Bank Transfer Day and actions against Mexican drug cartels, should indicate that this march is likely to be much more than the re-creation of an emotional movie scene.</p>

<p>Comments on AnonOps imply that thousands of Guy Fawkes masks have been purchased all over the world, and the Night of a Thousand Masks will not be limited to London.</p>

<p>The Black Triangle Network has posted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMjlpeHfCOk" rel="noopener noreferrer">video here</a> containing excerpts from “Equilibrium,” “V for Vendetta,” and recent news highlights, narrated by Charlie Chaplin in “The Great Dictator” who reads in part:</p>
<blockquote>"I’m sorry but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black men, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others’ happiness, not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men’s souls; has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge as made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all.

Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say “Do not despair.” The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish."</blockquote>
<p>We can only speculate as to what will happen in London, Oakland, New York, and throughout the world as the movement is reinforced by Anonymous. A few safe bets that there will be plenty of Guy Fawkes masks, more than a handful of arrests, and more people protesting than we’ve seen before.</p>
