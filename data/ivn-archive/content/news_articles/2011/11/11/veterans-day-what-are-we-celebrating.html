<p>Veterans Day, a day to honor our brave soldiers, right? Let’s not ignore the problems they face coming home from battle…a battle with the U.S. economy, unemployment, and homelessness.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>As our service members return to their families, many are discovering a new battlefield as they leave the military and search for civilian employment opportunities. -</span><span><a href="http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/on-veterans-day-a-new-battle-for-jobs/1200982" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Petersburg Times</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another problem? Homelessness for Veterans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>About 40% of homeless men are veterans, although veterans comprise only 34 percent of the general adult male population, according to <a href="http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/veterans.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">research on veterans</a> by the national Coalition for Homeless. On any given night, 200,000 veterans are homeless. -<a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/526/homeless-facts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">PBS Facts &amp; Figures</a></span></p>

<p><span>So what can we do on Veterans Day?&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>We can act. We can fight to ensure they have the benefits they’ve earned, the health care they need, and the tools to continue contributing to their communities.&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://www.pinejournal.com/event/article/id/22901/group/News/publisher_ID/39/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senator Al Franken</a></strong></p>
