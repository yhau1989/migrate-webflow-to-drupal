<p>We’ve seen the Occupy Movement heat up and interest and participate spreading worldwide. See what Thomas Hawk has to say about Occupy and the hacking group Anonymous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Of particular importance is the recent union between Occupy and Anonymous, a hacking group promoting internet freedom. &nbsp;The two have crossed paths before and this weekend they will be joining forces on a much larger scale.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>On 11-11-11 Anonymous will be joining in solidarity with the Occupy movement marching on London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral. Anonymous followers will be donning Guy Fawkes masks, aware observers should recognize the similarity between the march and the closing scene of V for Vendetta, where thousands of individuals march on Parliament dressed in black cloaks and Guy Fawkes masks.</p>
