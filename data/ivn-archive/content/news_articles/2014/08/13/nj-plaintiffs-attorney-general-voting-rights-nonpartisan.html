<p>(Newark, N.J.) -- In July, New Jersey Attorney General John J. Hoffman <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/29/nj-attorney-general-want-meaningful-vote-join-party/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a response</a> in federal court on behalf of the state of New Jersey (including Governor Chris Christie and Secretary of State Kim Guadagno) to an <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/03/motion-filed-nj-secretary-state-defends-interests-political-parties-voters/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposition</a> to the state's <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/05/12/nj-attorney-general-2-6-million-nj-voters-right-vote-primary/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">motion to dismiss</a> a <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/05/lawsuit-filed-nj-federal-court-challenges-constitutionality-partisan-primary-elections/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> defending the rights of voters. The lawsuit asserts that all voters have a fundamental right to equal and meaningful access to all integral stages of the electoral process.</p>

<p>In its response, the state argues that if voters want full participation in the voting process, they should join a political party.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, August 12, the plaintiffs filed a surreply to this argument, pointing out that the state is confusing the real issue at hand "by suggesting that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the individual right to cast a meaningful vote and the right of the Democratic and Republican parties to operate as private organizations."</p>

The plaintiffs argue that, "[f]undamental rights are, by nature, nonpartisan. More plainly, Defendantâ€™s position on the fundamental nature of our electoral system is one that this Court, the State of New Jersey, and every voter in New Jersey should flatly reject: that our rights within the democratic process may be conditioned on membership in one of two private organizations which almost half of all voters have chosen not to associate with."
