<h3>1. The Open Primary Initiative in Oregon has raised over <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/13/even-though-members-of-both-parties-oppose-this-oregon-ballot-measure-its-raised-more-than-1-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 million</a>.</h3>
<blockquote><em>"Despite the donations, the measure faces stiff opposition. “Both parties have&nbsp;come out against it,” Henderson said."</em></blockquote>
<p>The initiative would replace the current closed primary system with a nonpartisan, <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/16/initiative-adopt-top-two-open-primary-oregon-qualifies-ballot/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">top-two open primary</a> similar to the systems in Washington state and California.</p>
<h3>2. Article in the Bangor Daily News says real race in <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2014/08/15/opinion/contributors/why-maines-three-way-race-for-governor-could-actually-be-a-two-way-boxing-match/?ref=moreInopinion" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine gubernatorial election</a> is between Democrat Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler for the anti-incumbent vote.</h3>
<blockquote><em>"LePage has polarized the Maine electorate, strengthening his appeal among his core supporters but shifting centrists and independents decisively against him."</em></blockquote>
<p>Michaud is currently polling one point ahead of Governor&nbsp;LePage while Cutler is polling at 16 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average. The article highlights a fundamental truth on how independent and third-party candidates are treated under the current election system by the major parties and the media -- as spoiler campaigns.</p>
<h3>3. Wired.com features aspects of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/#ch-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Snowden story</a> that have mostly gone untold.</h3>
<blockquote>"Snowden will continue to haunt the US, the unpredictable impact of his actions resonating at home and around the world. The documents themselves, however, are out of his control. Snowden no longer has access to them; he says he didn’t bring them with him to Russia"</blockquote>
<p>It is a very interesting look at Snowden's life now and his thoughts on wanting to return home, privacy in the U.S., the NSA, and more.</p>
<h3>4. New York Times runs story on how the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/politics/seeing-missouri-unrest-views-begin-to-shift-among-conservatives.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">unrest in Ferguson</a> has been a more complicated issue among Republicans and conservatives than it may have been in the past.</h3>
<blockquote>"These reactions point to a larger debate inside the conservative movement today as Republicans struggle with how enthusiastically to embrace an ascendant strain of libertarianism within their ranks."</blockquote>
<p>Rand Paul certainly has a <a href="http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer">different message</a> than what we may have heard from many Republicans in the past when police have responded to protests in a similar manner. He said there should be a difference between a military response and a police response, and the images coming out of Ferguson, Missouri, "resemble war more than traditional police action."</p>
