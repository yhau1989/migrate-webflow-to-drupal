<p>Does Santa meet FAA regulations? Shouldn't we break up his viscous monopoly on Christmas? These are questions being asked by the creators of the new satirical animated Christmas movie, <em><a href="http://www.unclesamtamovie.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncle SAMta</a></em>, which hopes to provide a comedic, yet truthful look at the economy -- offering something to all ages as an aspiring Christmas classic for years to come.</p>

<p>With a tentative release date of November 2015, co-creator AJ Viviani said the script is almost finished and they are working full-time to get the project into full production.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="We thought Christmas -- particularly Santa -- would be a fun protagonist we could all get behind when government has run amok." author="AJ Viviani, co-creator of Uncle SAMta"]“We've already communicated with a few celebrities interested in doing voices in the film and are making headway with private investors who -- since our Kickstarter campaign -- have reached out to be a part of the project,” Viviani said in an interview for IVN.

<p>Viviani and his co-producer Sean Springer, both of whom are <a href="https://learn.fullsail.edu/Full_Sail_4a?mncid=412&amp;mnckeyword=full%20sail%20university&amp;utm_medium=INS&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_term=full%20sail%20university&amp;utm_content=Full_Sail_4a&amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;step=input" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Sail University</a> instructors, came up with the idea one night while knocking back a few cold ones and listening to TV talking heads discuss economic policy -- particularly Bernake's second quantitative easing.</p>

<p>“We'd often commentate on the commentators; we're actually kind of interested in what makes all this economics stuff work,” Viviani remarked.</p>

<p>After the laughter subsided -- and after playing with the idea of actually going into politics themselves -- they decided to instead mesh together their passions for storytelling with their interest in economics to create a family-friendly, satirical comedy.</p>

<p>Already having a background in film making and animation under their belts, along with their own in-house production studio (Playblast Productions), the duo began brainstorming.</p>

<p>“As we explored various topics, we thought Christmas, and particularly Santa, would be a fun protagonist we could all get behind when government has run amok,” said Viviani.</p>
<blockquote>“Does Santa meet FAA regulations? Shouldn't we break up his viscous Monopoly on Christmas? A true-to-life Uncle Sam emerges and suggests just that, providing a state-sanctioned, red-white-and-blue alternative holiday known as 'Fairness Day.'”</blockquote>
<p>Viviani said the film will be rated PG, released theatrically, and along with making people laugh, will hopefully educate kids about the political system in a way that isn't done through proper schooling.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Common Core -- and things like that -- don’t really teach kids the basic details of economics." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295648471" handle="" hashes=""]“Common Core -- and things like that -- don’t really teach [kids] the basic details of economics. The way they learn about the economy is by doing it themselves,” Viviani told <p><a href="http://benswann.com/filmmakers-go-to-kickstarter-to-launch-animated-film-for-kids-about-government-spending/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BenSwann.com</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond delivering a compelling, comedic, action-packed story, Viviani said he would like people to take away the same elements found within classics like Frank Capra's <em>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington</em> or Charles Dicken's <em>A Christmas Carol</em>.</p>

<p>“Both of those are political allegories that don't so much preach to the audience, but 'show' rather than 'tell,'” said Viviani, who also provided Disney's <em>Legend of Sleepy Hollow</em> featurette as an example of what they are aiming for. “That story had a beautiful high-brow narrative for parents and fun action for kids.”</p>

<p>The first Uncle SAMta <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ9mv_9Sl2E" rel="noopener noreferrer">promo video</a> released back in July, and the five-minute clip alone is sure to elicit a few laughs and provide a better picture of what's in store for viewers. The quality of production on the promo copy alone -- which involved 15 different artists from Disney, WB, Dreamworks, and Sony -- is top-notch.</p>
