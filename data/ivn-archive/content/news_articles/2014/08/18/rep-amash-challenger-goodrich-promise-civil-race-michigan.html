<p>Following a turbulent primary, the general election for Michigan's 3rd Congressional District may be shaping up to be surprisingly civil in tone.</p>

<p>On August 5, U.S. Rep. <strong>Justin Amash</strong> (R) survived a tough <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/21/amash-face-primary-challenge-shutdown-vote/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary</a> against well-funded businessman <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/16/primary-challenger-big-endorsements-justin-amash-leads-polls/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Ellis</a>. Just as noteworthy as Amash's victory was his speech following Ellis' concession.</p>

<p>A libertarian-minded Republican, Amash pulled no punches, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Aa1FGFlItU" rel="noopener noreferrer">chastising</a> lobbyist and former Michigan congressman Pete Hoekstra in addition to Ellis:</p>
<blockquote>"I ran for office to stop people like you. To stop people who are more interested in themselves than what's best for their district. Everyday Americans . . . are taking their government back from the political class elites. . . . They're taking it back from the insiders who have contempt for the American people."</blockquote>
<p>Then on Friday, in contrast to his pointed speech, Amash <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/08/us_rep_justin_amash_challenger.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">met</a> with his November challenger, <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/04/goodrich_theater_owner_democra.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">theater owner</a> and Democrat <strong><a href="http://bobgoodrichdemocrat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Goodrich</a></strong>.</p>

<p>On Twitter, Amash <a href="https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/500307447131934721" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote lang="en">Great meeting this morning at <a href="https://twitter.com/KavaHouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KavaHouse</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/_BobGoodrich_" rel="noopener noreferrer">@_BobGoodrich_</a>. Looking forward to a constructive discussion of ideas. <a href="http://t.co/aUvIVfOoEX" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aUvIVfOoEX</a>

â€” Justin Amash (@justinamash) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinamash/statuses/500307447131934721" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Amash's choice of words may not be random following a vitriolic primary. In one of those primary ads, Ellis <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/210513-amash-opponent-calls-him-al-qaedas-best-friend-in-ad" rel="noopener noreferrer">charged</a> Amash, who is of Middle Eastern descent, as "al Qaeda's best friend in Congress."</p>

<p>Goodrich's office released a <a href="http://woodtv.com/2014/08/15/amash-goodrich-meet-talk-about-nov-campaign/" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> indicating his intention to run a clean, productive race:</p>
<blockquote>"'It's just politics' is not acceptable behavior; you never see a businessman personally attack another businessman, or lawyers in a courtroom personalize the debate; you never see a jeweler accuse another jeweler of being a criminal. My campaign will be about ideas, historical successes, and accessibility for all citizens of the 3rd congressional district."</blockquote>
<p>Also in contrast to Amash's race against Ellis, the incumbent has agreed to a series of <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/08/us_rep_justin_amash_challenger.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+grpress+%28The+Grand+Rapids+Press+Latest+News+|+MLive.com%29" rel="noopener noreferrer">public forums</a> with his challenger, though no formal debate is scheduled yet.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Rep. @justinamash has agreed to a series of public forums with Democrat @_BobGoodrich_." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295649074" handle="" hashes=""]On his campaign website, Goodrich <p><a href="http://bobgoodrichdemocrat.com/bobs-story" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> he is running on a platform of "economic fairness for all Americans," as well as "women's rights . . . and government protecting our economic health." Against the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2014/03/misleading-abortion-attack-in-michigan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-life</a> libertarian Amash, vigorous disagreements should be expected.</p>

<p>Michigan's 3rd Congressional District <a href="http://www.electionprojection.com/2014-elections/michigan-elections.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">leans Republican</a>, so Amash's toughest electoral challenge of the year is likely behind him. First elected in 2010 on the tea party wave, Amash <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/06/justin-amash-wins-michigans-3rd-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer">survived</a> in 2012 after redistricting left him in less favorable territory. He has now staved off an equitable primary opponent and has all the advantages of incumbency against a political newcomer who ran unopposed in his primary.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the primary and without any substantial polling available, the race is still technically in its early stages. Amash may not have much to worry about in a district he has successfully defended before, but he and opponent Bob Goodrich have set up an initial standard for a clean race focused on ideas.</p>
