<p>Slate's Dave Weigel recently <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/08/the_muted_response_to_new_iraq_strikes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that the GOP response to President Obama's <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/07/president-obama-authorizes-airstrikes-in-iraq/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_home&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision</a> to launch airstrikes in Iraq has been "muted." The <strong><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-04-17/guest-post-liberty-movement-rising" rel="noopener noreferrer">liberty movement</a></strong> in Congress, on the other hand, has already spoken up and has a record of past statements that offer a recommendation for dealing with the current crisis.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/161399/10th-anniversary-iraq-war-mistake.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">many </a>in the U.S. today say that the Iraq war was a <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/03/22/the-iraq-war-ten-years-later-a-one-time-supporters-lament-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mistake</a>, there is also a feeling that the current round of airstrikes is <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100282821/bombing-iraq-isnt-an-act-of-war-its-an-act-of-mercy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">necessary</a> to correct that initial mistake. Yet President Obama is making war for the second time in three years without going to Congress. His suggestion that the strikes could become a "<a href="http://news.antiwar.com/2014/08/09/obama-vows-long-term-war-in-iraq/" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term</a> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/obama-warns-long-term-project-iraq-n176741" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>" raises many questions.</p>

<p>Columnist Tim Carney captured the ambiguity of the operation, <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/in-iraq-obama-launches-another-drive-by-war/article/2551859?custom_click=rss" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Will we bomb until ISIS is eliminated? Or does ISIS simply need to be contained? Are we simply protecting Kurdistan, the semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq? What if American intervention becomes a rallying cry for other terrorist groups in the region? Will we bomb them, too?"</blockquote>
<p>With these questions in mind, Texas U.S. Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> (R), generally the most hawkish of anyone <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/01/ted-cruz-scores-ron-paul-a-win-in-texas-senate-primary/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">associated</a> with the liberty movement, did not explicitly say how he might vote. However, he did <a href="http://time.com/3096874/republicans-iraq-isis-obama-cruz-santorum-huckabee-jindal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"I believe initiating new military hostilities in a sustained basis in Iraq obligates the president to go back to Congress and to make the case and to seek congressional authorization."</blockquote>
<p>U.S. Rep. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/2013/01/20/kentucky-us-rep-thomas-massie-charts-his-own-path/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Massie</a></strong> (R-Ky.) gave perhaps the most defiant dissent to the president's recent actions in a radio <a href="http://www.whas11.com/community/blogs/political-blog/Yarmuth-supports-airstrikes-warns-against-ground-troops-270498331.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Article 1, Section 8 . . . gives Congress -- not the president -- the power to declare war. These air strikes require congressional authorization, and the American people deserve open debate by their elected officials."</blockquote>
<p>Massie concluded that, "because the president has not articulated a long-term strategy, I would vote against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq."</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Congress should vote on (airstrikes in Iraq) because that's what the Constitution says." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295648676" handle="@SenRandPaul" hashes=""]U.S. Senator <p><strong>Rand Paul</strong> (R-Ky.) has been one of the more <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/29/israel-rand-paul-bridge-conservative-libertarian-ideas/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">skeptical</a> members of Congress concerning foreign interventions. An admitted critic of the 2003 Iraq war, Paul notably declined to blame the Obama administration for the current violence in Iraq, but <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rand-paul-blame-dick-cheney-for-iraq-violence-not-president-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed</a> to an administration of his own party for instigating instability 11 years ago.</p>

<p>Paul has said he has not ruled out airstrikes, but <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2014/06/20/Rand-Paul-Urges-Congressional-Vote-Before-Air-Strikes-on-Iraq" rel="noopener noreferrer">believes</a> "Congress should vote on it because that's what the Constitution says." Along with his Republican colleague <strong>Mike Lee</strong> (R-UT), Paul also participated in a bipartisan effort to <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1070" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeal</a> the Authorization for Use of Force in Iraq in January.</p>

<p>Successful repeal would have presumably precluded President Obama from his latest actions.</p>

<p>The reintroduction of American military force to Iraq could take any of several turns that might eventually include <a href="https://time.com/3099240/perry-us-ground-troops-iraq-isis-gop/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ground</a> <a href="http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/09/iraq-mission-require-ground-troops/13843605/" rel="noopener noreferrer">troops</a>. The liberty movement, while still offering up its prescriptions for the current crisis, has provided one recommendation: let the American people decide through their elected representatives.</p>
