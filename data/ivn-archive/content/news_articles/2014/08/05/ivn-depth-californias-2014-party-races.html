<p>Polls show that most Americans believe the U.S. is a more divided nation, politically, than it was 4 years ago. Seventy-two percent of Americans support the inclusion of independent voters in primary elections. And, 50 percent of registered voters say their own member of Congress deserves re-election.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="In California, 25 races in November will be between candidates in the same party." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295647933" handle="" hashes=""]

<p>These statistics are the consequences of a long-term trend, which has fewer and fewer voters putting their confidence in the ability of either <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/04/25/majority-americans-say-major-parties-dont-represent/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">major political party</a> to adequately represent them. Terms like “safe seats,” “political bid,” and “party discipline” are the products of a partisan-based electoral system that has governed our representative form of democracy for generations — systems that were developed at a time when nearly every voter identified with one of the two major parties.</p>

<p>Today, however, almost <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/01/08/party-registration-drops-new-lows-indpendents-time-high/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">half of the electorate</a> self-identifies as a political independent. In New Jersey, for example, <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/29/nj-attorney-general-want-meaningful-vote-join-party/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">47 percent</a> of registered voters are unaffiliated. In California, the number is close to 22 percent. When only major party voters are allowed to vote in a primary election, only those voters are given an opportunity to meaningfully participate. The consequence is that representatives are primarily accountable to voters registered with their party.</p>

<p>California’s top-two primary has done away with the traditional party-oriented structure by placing all candidates on a single ballot, and allowing all voters to participate in the same manner, regardless of their party affiliation, or lack thereof. The top-two candidates advance, regardless of their party affiliation.</p>

<p>As a consequence, seasoned incumbents are being challenged even in districts that would otherwise be “safe” for “their party.” And in 25 of these races, heavily Democratic or Republican districts will see members of the same party face-off in November. Under the “old rules,” whoever won the majority party primary would have de facto already won their seat.</p>

<p>This means that, unlike previous years, these candidates have to appeal to voters outside their own party.</p>
