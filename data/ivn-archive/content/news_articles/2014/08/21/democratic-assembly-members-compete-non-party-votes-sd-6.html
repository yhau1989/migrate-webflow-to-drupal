<p>Senate District 6 represents the entire city of Sacramento, and since redistricting in 2011, includes parts of Yolo County. Almost 50 percent of its constituents are registered with the Democrat Party. Added with the district's voting record, it should be no surprise that the area is considered a Democratic stronghold.</p>

<p>Republican candidates James Axelgard and Jonathan Zachariou fell short in the district's nonpartisan, top-two primary in June. Since 2002, the district has had a vote disbursement average of 63 percent to 31 percent, Democrats to Republicans. In the 2014 primary, the first in the district under "Top-Two," the two Republicans only garnered 15.9 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>The top-two primary was approved by a majority of voters under Proposition 14 in 2010. Under the new system, all voters and candidates, regardless of party affiliation, participate on a single ballot. The top two vote-getters then advance to the general election. In a district that heavily favors one party over another, like Senate District 6, this can result in same-party general elections.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two Democrats, Assembly members <strong>Roger Dickinson</strong> and <strong>Richard Pan</strong>, emerged from the district's <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/04/calif-voters-biggest-winners-primary-election-day/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary</a>. Though they divided the Democratic vote, they took 40.3 percent and 31.1 percent of the vote, respectively. For the first time in the district's history, the votes of independents, Republicans, Greens, and Libertarians matter. Indeed, they may determine the outcome of the election if the two candidates continue to split the Democratic vote evenly.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="For the first time in the district's history, the votes of independents, Republicans, Greens, and Libertarians matter." author=""] In 1999, according to California’s secretary of state, 11.6 percent of registered voters in the district were registered No Party Preference. By 2014, that number almost doubled to just over 21 percent. If current trends continue, independent voters will soon make up a larger percentage of the district's electorate than Republicans, who currently make up 25.17 percent of voters.

<p>This shift in the political landscape is not isolated to a single district, as independent voters already make up the second largest voting bloc in some <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/14/dem-v-dem-race-mike-honda-faces-first-serious-threat-incumbency/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_home&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">electoral districts</a> in California. It is a trend that is happening all over the state and is <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/05/28/california-candidates-defending-individual-voter-rights-and-top-two-primary/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_home&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">changing the way</a> candidates view their constituents and state politics.</p>

<p>The red and blue maps depicted on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC during election time have become an outdated method of coverage -- coverage that should also look at elections in California, including the race between&nbsp;Dickinson and Pan, beyond partisan terms.</p>

<p>Both candidates are running on similar platforms, but they cannot rely on Democratic voters as they would have in the past. The field of candidates was narrowed from 6 to 2 and Democrats, Republicans, independents, and third-party voters will all have a chance to decide which of these two candidates will represent Senate District 6 in Sacramento.</p>

<p>When asked how his campaign has reached out to voters outside his party, Pan responded:</p>
<blockquote>“Since my election in 2010, I reached across party lines in the Assembly to bring people together and solve problems in the community. Our current outreach efforts include contacting constituents outside of the Democratic Party, including those with no party affiliation. With the support of nonpartisan voters, I can bring to the State Senate a perspective that combines people’s real-world concerns with science-based approaches to address the issues that we face together as Californians.”</blockquote>
