<p>On Thursday, during an interview with <em>NPR’s Weekend Edition Saturday</em>, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said that he believes our beloved federal government should<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/24/306524864/retired-justice-john-paul-stevens-marijuana-should-be-legal" rel="noopener noreferrer"> legalize marijuana.</a></p>

<p>The former high court host said he feels that it should be legalized due to the <a href="http://the420times.com/2014/01/bill-gates-voted-to-legalize-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer">changing mindset</a> that’s taking place on a national basis.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Stevens said in response to show host Scott Simon’s question as to whether possessing marijuana should be legal under federal law:</p>
<blockquote>“I really think that that’s another instance of public opinion [that's] changed. And recognize that the distinction between marijuana and alcoholic beverages is really not much of a distinction. Alcohol, the prohibition against selling and dispensing alcoholic beverages has I think been generally, there’s a general consensus that it was not worth the cost. And I think really in time that will be the general consensus with respect to this particular drug.”</blockquote>
<p>Appointed by President Gerald Ford, Stevens deems himself as a conservative, but he was also considered part of the court’s liberal wing.</p>

<p>The former Supreme Court ruler has been stirring up a little controversy as of late with a new book that was recently published, <em>Six Amendments,</em>&nbsp;in which he recommends six changes to the U.S. Constitution. A few of his ideas include abolishing the death penalty, enforcing limits on how much money corporate entities can “donate” to elections, and executing stricter gun control laws.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to a time when the powers that be can be honest and forthright regarding their position on important issues such as reforming our current drug policy without having to retire first.</p>
