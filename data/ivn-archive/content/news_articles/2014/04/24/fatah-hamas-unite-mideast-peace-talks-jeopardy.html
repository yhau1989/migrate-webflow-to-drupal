<p>On Wednesday, another complication was added to the current peace talks between Israel and Palestine when Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas’ political party, Fatah,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27128902" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed a unity accord</a>&nbsp;with Hamas (the party ruling the Gaza Strip and largely recognized as a terrorist organization), ending a 7 year divide within the Palestinian society.</p>

<p>Fatah and Hamas plan to form an interim unity government within 5 weeks, and they will hold parliamentary elections within 6 months.</p>

<p>Isreali Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his displeasure when learning about the agreement in a statement:</p>
<blockquote>“Instead of moving into peace with Israel, he’s [Abbas] moving into peace with Hamas… Does he want peace with Hamas or peace with Israel? You can have one but not the other. I hope he chooses peace; so far he hasn’t done so.”</blockquote>
<p>However, President Abbas disagrees that acquiring peace with Israel or Hamas should be mutually exclusive.</p>

He mentioned in a statement that there is "no incompatibility between reconciliation and the [peace] talks.” He maintains that Palestinian leadership remains committed to peace negotiations rooted in a two-state solution.

<p>Hamas isn't exactly a morally sound -- or ideal -- political organization. However, they have made progressive steps toward peace, such as agreeing to&nbsp;accept a <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/haniyeh-hamas-willing-to-accept-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders-1.256915" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palestinian state</a>&nbsp;based on the 1967 borders if Israel recognizes the national rights of Palestinians.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="#Fatah and #Hamas plan to form an interim unity government within 5 weeks." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295641721" handle="lpb347" hashes=""]In regards to Hamas' armed struggle, it's worth remembering that Fatah was a major part of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), a group that was also once labeled a terrorist organization. It wasn't until the PLO denounced terrorism and recognized Israel that the U.S. and Israel would negotiate with the organization.

<p>Whether or not one approves of Hamas’ role in Palestinian society is irrelevant because the fact is that they already exist. It would be a mistake to think that Hamas and Gaza could be ignored for the entirety of these negotiations without Israelis and Palestinians enduring consequences.</p>

<p>In Abbas' view, integrating Hamas into current talks doesn’t imply his support for violence against Israel. Rather, it helps mitigate a potentially violent division within Palestinian society.</p>

<p>But many Israelis, including Netanyahu's spokesman, Mark Regev, see the situation in a much different light.</p>

<p>"This is a move by President Abbas away from peace, away from reconciliation," Regev stated. "We will not talk to a government that has in it people who say my country should be destroyed."</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Hamas has extremely strong ties to charitable social programs throughout the Gaza Strip." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295641721" handle="" hashes=""]Hamas has extremely strong ties to charitable social programs throughout the Gaza Strip, they have dwindling support from <p><a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/08/24/Arab-Springs-derailment-has-Hamas-on-the-ropes/UPI-15771377354000/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous allies</a> like the Muslim Brotherhood, Syria, and Iran, and the PA faces <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/plo-hamas-agree-unity-pact-form-government" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential cuts</a> from U.S. and EU funding if Hamas is granted government positions.</p>

<p>In other words, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority are on thin ice.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Hamas will reflect on the PLO's denouncement of violence against Israel, subsequent rise to political power in the late 80s, and recognize their opportunity to do the same now.</p>

<p>Netanyahu claims that the PA can have peace with either Israel or Hamas, but not both. However, this dichotomy doesn't have to be true.&nbsp;Rather than assume this unification points to a radicalized Palestinian Authority, many hope it marks the integration of a moderate Hamas.</p>
