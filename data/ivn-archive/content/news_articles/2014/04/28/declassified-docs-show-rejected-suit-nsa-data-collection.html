<p>A phone service provider filed a lawsuit -- which was subsequently rejected -- against NSA data collection, according to a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/220428971/Fisa-Court-Challenge-Ruling" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/a-phone-company-fought-the-nsa-and-the-nsa-won-20140425" rel="noopener noreferrer">declassified</a> on Friday. The company's name is redacted in the documents, but the <em>Washington Post</em> article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/surveillance-court-rejected-verizon-challenge-to-nsa-calls-program/2014/04/25/78d430c2-ccc2-11e3-93eb-6c0037dde2ad_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that it was the popular mobile service provider Verizon.</p>

<p>The particular issue at stake was the NSA requiring the company to relinquish phone records as part of the government agency's metadata collection. The records collected <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/a-phone-company-fought-the-nsa-and-the-nsa-won-20140425" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a> phone numbers dialed, call times, and call durations, but not the content of calls.</p>

<p>The documents report that it was in January that the suit was filed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). It was rejected in March.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The rejected lawsuit marked the first known time a phone company formally challenged or questioned the constitutionality of the metadata collection." author=""]Verizon's lawsuit was <p><a href="https://recode.net/2014/04/26/verizon-challenged-the-nsas-phone-data-collection-program-and-lost/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed</a> after Federal District Court Judge Richard J. Leon <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/us/politics/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-data-program.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered</a> the government to stop collecting data on a pair of plaintiffs in a particular case. Leon's order has generally been <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2013/12/16/73561/" rel="noopener noreferrer">interpreted</a> as an indication that the data collection may eventually be ruled unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Issuing the March ruling was Federal District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer, who also sits on the FISC. She <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/us/phone-company-bid-to-keep-data-from-nsa-is-rejected.html?hpw&amp;rref=technology&amp;_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">justified</a> her ruling through a 1979 Supreme Court case, saying that Americans can have little expectation of privacy when dialing phone numbers. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/surveillance-court-rejected-verizon-challenge-to-nsa-calls-program/2014/04/25/78d430c2-ccc2-11e3-93eb-6c0037dde2ad_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">disputes</a> this interpretation of the case, <em>Smith v. Maryland</em>, which involved a single individual over a period of several days. The NSA, the ACLU points out, "collects hundreds of millions of Americans' phone records in bulk, indefinitely."</p>

<p>Collyer also <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304788404579524433747260454" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled</a> that Judge Leon's concerns about the duration of time the government holds information is "irrelevant in determining whether a Fourth Amendment search has occurred."</p>

<p>Collyer was a recent figure in a lawsuit filed by the family of Anwar al-Awlaki, the suspected American-born terrorist extra-judicially killed in 2011 by a drone in Yemen. She <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/04/08/bipartisan-team-wants-transparency-u-s-drone-policy/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">upheld</a> the government's request to dismiss the motion on the grounds that individuals in the government cannot be held legally liable.</p>

<p>The rejected lawsuit marked the first known time a phone company formally challenged or questioned the constitutionality of the metadata collection. Last year, it was reported that no company had actively resisted the NSA's program.</p>

<p>The papers also show that the company <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304788404579524433747260454" rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted</a> the court to "vacate, modify, or reaffirm" its past decisions, a sign that the company was primarily looking to see that it was abiding by the established law. Still, the court ultimately declined to even listen to the case.</p>

<p>There still remain other <a href="https://www.lptexas.org/latest-news-menu/1097-libertarian-candidate-for-congress-sues-nsa-for-privacy-violations" rel="noopener noreferrer">outstanding</a> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/12/sen-paul-announces-historic-class-action-suit-against-nsa-spying/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuits</a> against the NSA and Verizon and the others may still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
