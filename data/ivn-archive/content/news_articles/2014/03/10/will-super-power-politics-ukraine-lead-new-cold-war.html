<p>Putin’s dream of unifying ex-Soviet states to create a <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/eurasian-economic-union-with-russia-at-centre-of-putins-endgame/story-e6frgd0x-1226844074752#mm-premium" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurasian Economic Union</a> (Belarus and Kazakhstan have already joined) has been a primary driver for Russia’s intervention thus far. Putin <a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68112" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently</a> pushed for a revitalization of Russian identity by promoting legislation that would allow anyone fluent in Russian who lives, or family once lived, in the area of the Soviet Union to apply for Russian citizenship.</p>

<p>Crimea plays a central role in Putin’s ambition to create a Eurasian Economic Union given its access to warm water ports and strong Russian identity. The <a href="http://rbth.com/international/2014/02/27/will_crimea_break_away_from_ukraine_34625.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">population in Crimea</a> is 58 percent Russian, 24 percent Ukrainian, and 12 percent Crimean Tatar. However, 97 percent of the population uses Russian as their primary or only language.</p>

<p>Crimea is wedged between Russian and Ukrainian identity. Although it falls under Ukraine’s sovereignty, according to international law, Crimea has had periods of autonomous rule in the past, and it recently announced its desire to ally with Russia by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26465962" rel="noopener noreferrer">declaring a referendum</a> (to be voted on March 16) which would allow Crimea to join the Russian Federation under autonomous rule.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The population in Crimea is 58% Russian, 24% Ukrainian, and 12% Crimean Tatar." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638619" handle="" hashes=""]The <p><a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68112" rel="noopener noreferrer">de facto</a> Russian control over military in the region leads some experts to believe that Crimea may be on its way to becoming an <a href="http://rbth.com/international/2014/02/27/will_crimea_break_away_from_ukraine_34625.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">unrecognized state</a> protected by the Russians.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/06/cnr.05.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> recently stated that the "proposed referendum on the future of Crimea would violate the Ukrainian constitution and violate international law.”</p>

<p>The U.S. giving credence to international law is interesting given its general <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/05/17617277-un-says-us-violating-international-law-calls-for-closure-of-guantanamo?lite" rel="noopener noreferrer">lack</a> of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq" rel="noopener noreferrer">respect</a> for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/02/nato-gaddafi-libya-air-strikes" rel="noopener noreferrer">international law</a>. It’s more <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/power-delusions-u-dot-s-dot-russia-face-off-over-ukraine#p1" rel="noopener noreferrer">likely</a> that the U.S. is rehashing Cold War power politics and trying to prevent Putin from reorganizing a new Soviet Union under the guise of international law.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the U.S. and most of their European allies imposed <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/06/live-updates-crimea-moves-to-autonomy-as-eu-leaders-meet-in-brussels/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctions</a> on Russia, and Russia’s response will likely solidify whether this conflict will deflate or escalate. The U.S. and Russia’s opposing stances on Crimea and the future of the Ukrainian economy, combined with the failed negotiations that led up to these sanctions, paints a negative future for those hoping to resolve the situation quickly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/06/world/europe/ukraine-crimea-locals/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia</a> and the West are both claiming ownership over the rights and interests of Ukraine and Crimea, but this conflict has clearly escalated outside of Ukrainian hands. The upcoming political plays between Russia and the U.S. will decide whether the world’s largest powers will rise above the age of uncompromising power politics or if this will mark the beginning of a new Cold War era.</p>
