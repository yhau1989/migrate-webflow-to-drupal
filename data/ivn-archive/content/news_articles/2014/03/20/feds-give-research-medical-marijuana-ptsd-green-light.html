<p>A study that would explore the possible benefits of marijuana for those who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder got a huge green light from the federal government.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="After 22 years, feds give research group approval to use cannabis to test health care implications." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295639614" handle="" hashes=""]The research project, headed by Dr.&nbsp;Suzanne Sisley of the University of Arizona, already had approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

<p>But, like a lot of studies involving pot, it hit a bottleneck in trying to obtain cannabis from the only legitimate place it could — the&nbsp;National Institute on Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) sole marijuana farm in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Critics say NIDA has long been wary of attempts to prove that marijuana has medicinal benefits. But, in a move hailed as tacit approval for the study by the Obama administration itself, the PTSD research <a href="http://the420times.com/2013/05/ptsd-and-medical-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">received approval</a> to receive federal weed.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS):</p>
<blockquote>On March 14, 2014, in an historic shift in federal policy, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&nbsp;granted permission&nbsp;for MAPS to purchase research-grade marijuana from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) for our planned study of&nbsp;marijuana for symptoms of PTSD&nbsp;in U.S. veterans.</blockquote>
<p>The group says this is the first time in 22 years of trying that feds have granted access to this sole source of legit, United States-produced cannabis.</p>

<p>However, MAPS says the study still requires approval from the DEA. The research will also need cash from supporters, the group says. The organization previously described the research as a:</p>
<blockquote>...placebo-controlled, triple-blind, randomized crossover pilot study is the first of its kind, and will investigate the safety and efficacy of marijuana for PTSD in veterans using four marijuana strains each with a different level of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) along with a fifth strain containing equal amounts of THC (6%) and cannabidiol (CBD) (6%). PTSD symptoms will be compared across conditions during four weeks of self-administration to determine if strain potency or drug delivery method affects PTSD severity.</blockquote>
<p>Good luck.</p>
