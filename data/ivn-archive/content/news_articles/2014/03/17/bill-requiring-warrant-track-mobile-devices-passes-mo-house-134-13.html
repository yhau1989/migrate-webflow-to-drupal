<p>In Missouri, the state House of Representatives recently and overwhelmingly <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/state-and-regional/missouri/mo-house-passes-curb-on-electronic-tracking/article_18fb1003-a2bf-5f61-9e17-8c8d64937bba.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> a bill that would compel law enforcement officials to get a warrant before tracking a person's electronic mobile device(s).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills141/billpdf/perf/HB1388P.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two pages</a> long, Missouri House Bill 1388 amends Chapter 542 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri pertaining to "Proceedings to Preserve the Peace - Searches and Seizures." The bill is sponsored by Republican <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/member.aspx?district=064" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Cornejo</a> of St. Peters, who <a href="http://mdn.org/2014/STORIES/CELL130.HTM" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> upon introducing his bill in January, "The data you're able to collect off a cell phone is pretty powerful . . . law enforcement officials can now access a pretty clear picture of your entire life," without having to prove probable cause.</p>

<p>One critic of Cornejo's bill is fellow Republican State Rep. Bill White of Jopline, who <a href="http://mdn.org/2014/STORIES/CELL130.HTM" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"I appreciate what you're doing in terms of privacy, but I want to make sure we don't hamstring law enforcement in legitimate activities."</blockquote>
<p>The amendment outlines the conditions in which one's electronic devices may be tracked: "A government entity shall not obtain the location information of an electronic device without a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction," <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills141/billpdf/perf/HB1388P.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer">unless</a>:</p>
<blockquote>1. The device is reported stolen by the owner;

2. To respond to the user's call for emergency services;

3. With the informed affirmative consent of the owner or user of the electronic device; or

4. A possible life-threatening situation exists</blockquote>
<p>The bill goes on to say that any evidence obtained that violates the amendment will be inadmissible in "civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding."</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Missouri bill to require warrants for tracking mobile devices receives strong bipartisan support." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295639221" handle="" hashes=""] The <p><a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_House_of_Representatives" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican-led</a> Missouri House of Representatives <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/state-and-regional/missouri/mo-house-passes-curb-on-electronic-tracking/article_18fb1003-a2bf-5f61-9e17-8c8d64937bba.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> HB 1388 134-13, receiving strong support from both parties. The bill now moves to the Missouri <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Senate" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate</a> where Republicans also hold a majority, 24-9. If it passes, then it moves to the desk of Democratic Governor Jay Nixon.</p>

<p>Nixon has not indicated what he will do with the bill, which still faces the Senate, but the second-term governor already has the distinction of being the Missouri chief executive with the most veto <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/09/13/veto-session-makes-governor-most-overridden-in-almost-two-centuries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">overrides</a> in nearly two hundred years. While Republicans tallied up ten veto overrides during a single session in 2013, the bigger issues of a GOP tax cut and the state's interposition on federal gun regulations <a href="http://www.pitch.com/FastPitch/archives/2013/09/12/3799456-missouri-legislature-overrides-several-jay-nixon-vetoes-but-not-the-ones-gop-leaders-really-wanted" rel="noopener noreferrer">fell short</a> of an override.</p>

<p>In addition to requiring government agencies to get a search warrant before tracking an electronic device, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/26/missouri-pushes-for-state-sovereignty/4915629/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missouri</a> has been at the forefront of the so-called state sovereignty <a href="http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2009/02/09/state-sovereignty-movement-quietly-growing/?doing_wp_cron=1395009858.7185120582580566406250#.UyZMYIWTK8A" rel="noopener noreferrer">movement</a>. Other Missouri legislation designed to curb federal government power has included a variety of bills nullifying certain federal gun laws as well as same-sex marriage, which Missouri voters rejected in 2004.</p>
