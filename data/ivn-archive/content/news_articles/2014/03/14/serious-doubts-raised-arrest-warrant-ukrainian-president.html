[social_blockquote quote="Yanukovych’s innocence challenges every decision made in Ukraine" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638662" handle="" hashes=""]It has been internationally reported that near a&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/ukraine-dead-protesters-police" rel="noopener noreferrer">hundred Ukrainian protesters were killed</a>&nbsp;in February of this year, mostly by sniper fire.</p>

<p>At the time, protesters and international news agencies blamed Ukrainian police, under the direction of Ukrainian President Viktor&nbsp;Yanukovych for the mass murders.</p>

<p>Once the coup government took power, they issued a&nbsp;<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">warrant for Yanukovych’s arrest</a>&nbsp;for the mass murder of protesters. Reported by international news and taken by international governments as legitimate, his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/28/switzerland-austria-and-liechtenstein-freeze-assets-and-bank-accounts-of-/" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets&nbsp;were seized</a>.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEgJ0oo3OA8#t=114" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked phone call</a>, Estonian FM Paet questions the evidence against Yanukovych.</p>
<blockquote>"There is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition.”

&nbsp;

“It already discredits from the very beginning this new coalition."</blockquote>
<p>On March 7, 2014, the coup government admits&nbsp;<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/russia-ukraine-feud-over-sniper-carnage" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yanukovych is no longer a suspect</a>.</p>
<blockquote>"Ukrainian authorities are investigating the Feb. 18-20 bloodbath, and they have shifted their focus from ousted President Viktor Yanukovych’s government."</blockquote>
<p>(Read:&nbsp;Yanukovych is Innocent… as in… innocent until proven guilty)</p>

<p>Why should anyone care?</p>

<p>Yanukovych&nbsp;is innocent.</p>

<p>These mass sniper killings were a crime aimed at creating chaos and terror. According to the Associated Press:</p>
<blockquote>"Snipers firing powerful rifles from rooftops and windows shot scores of people in the heart of Kiev. Some victims were opposition protesters, but many were civilian bystanders clearly not involved in the clashes. Among the dead were medics, as well as police officers. A majority of the more than 100 people who died in the violence were shot by snipers."</blockquote>
<p>Yanukovych’s proven innocence of these sniper killings challenges the justification of every decision made by stakeholders, inside Ukraine and internationally, that was based on the conclusion that&nbsp;Yanukovych was guilty of murdering his people.</p>

<p>More importantly, since&nbsp;Yanukovych is no longer considered a suspect in these crimes, why hasn’t the warrant for his arrest been removed? Further, why hasn’t the asset seizure been lifted?</p>

<p>As a result, Russia is calling for an<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jRTyxKCcmd15X89MyTTH0v9jPTSQ?docId=3e5a280b-2b57-402f-b5bc-5ed24be66b7b" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;international investigation</a>, rather than one conducted by the coup government alone.&nbsp;Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated:</p>
<blockquote>"The latest information about the so-called snipers case can no longer be covered up.

&nbsp;

We have proposed that the OSCE takes up an objective investigation of this and we will ensure there is justice.

&nbsp;

There have been too many lies, and this lie has been used too long to push European public opinion in the wrong direction, contrary to the objective facts."</blockquote>
<p>If it turns out protest extremists were responsible for these mass murders, then some of the leaders of the current coup government may be guilty of terrorism against the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p>Until a credible, international investigation has been concluded, Ukrainian men, women, and children will continue to suffer for these vicious crimes.</p>
