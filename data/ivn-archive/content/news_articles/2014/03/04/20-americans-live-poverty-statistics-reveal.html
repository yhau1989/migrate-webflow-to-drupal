[advertisement title="" type="outset"]A lot of conversation has occurred about the minimum wage -- or livable wage movement -- popularized by a recent victory in Seatac, Washington, which spread across the state and has now gained the attention of President Obama.

<p>Across the country, employees are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/fast-food-workers-strike-minimum-wage" rel="noopener noreferrer">striking</a>, <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2012/11/23/protesters-picket-at-walmart-stores-across-the-country-and-here-in-richmond/" rel="noopener noreferrer">picketing</a>, and staging <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fast-food-workers-plan-a-new-wave-of-walkouts-across-the-nation/2013/12/03/b64809e4-5b87-11e3-a49b-90a0e156254b_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">walkouts</a>, protesting low wages and poor working conditions. Walmart, in particular, provides associates a directory to help them locate their <a href="http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/why-walmart-loves-welfare" rel="noopener noreferrer">local medicaid office</a>. Further, Jon Lehman, a former 17-year veteran Walmart manager, disclosed to PBS that he was instructed by Walmart Corporate how to direct his employees to apply for charity, community assistance, and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript247_full.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-provided welfare</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/13poverty.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal poverty guidelines</a>, provided by the&nbsp;U.S. DHHS, Office for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, are used by programs to determine eligibility for financial assistance. For a single person living in the continental United States (Excluding Alaska and Hawaii), the poverty level is $11,490 a year. This amount represents approximately 7.3 months of gross income working full-time at $9 per hour. A month of employment -- for purposes of this article -- being defined as 173 hours of work.</p>

<p>After tax deductions, and before receiving a tax return, the net income (or take home pay) is actually somewhere between 8 and 9 months of work, based on a single individual claiming zero or one on their withholding statement.</p>

<p>For a family of four, the poverty line is $23,550.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="For a single person living in the continental US, the poverty level is $11,490/year. " hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638260" handle="Bobb1elewi1s" hashes=""]It would be useful to have some sort of realistic measurement of necessary costs associated with maintaining a household at a reasonable level, rather than the poverty level alone. Fortunately, the IRS has adopted <p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Collection-Financial-Standards" rel="noopener noreferrer">collection and financial standards</a> which define what it considers to be necessary living expenses.</p>

<p>For 2013, in King County, Washington, the IRS states that <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Washington—Local-Standards:-Housing-and-Utilities" rel="noopener noreferrer">necessary housing and utility costs</a> for a single person are capped at $2,106 per month with <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/National-Standards-Food-Clothing-and-Other-Items" rel="noopener noreferrer">food, clothing, and other necessary expenses</a> being capped at $583 per month. In addition, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/National-Standards-Out-of-Pocket-Health-Care" rel="noopener noreferrer">out-of-pocket health care</a> is capped at $60 per month for a person under age 65.</p>

<p>It’s math time again.</p>

<p>To be able to be able to pay just the IRS defined necessary living expenses in King County, Washington, this single person would need to earn $2,749.00 a month ($2106+$583+$60=$2,749) minimum. This amounts to $15.89 per hour. After considering tax deductions on gross income, the necessary hourly wage is higher.</p>

<p>These expenses do not include car payments or costs associated with keeping necessary career skills up to date, such as college or technical education.</p>

<p>These numbers, to me, represent a reasonable livable wage for a single person.</p>

<p>The Alliance for a Just Society recently published a report called the <a href="http://jobgap2013.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/wa_2013-job-gap_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">15th Annual Job Gap Study</a>. The study’s findings included the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A single person needed to earn $16.04 per hour to pay for necessary living expenses.</li>
	<li>There are 7 job seekers for every open job that pays a livable wage being defined at $15 per hour or higher.</li>
	<li>[social_link quote="In 2012, 39.45% of all jobs in the U.S. paid below the $15 per hour livable wage standard." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638260" handle="" hashes=""]</li>
</ul>
<p>Not earning a livable wage is unsustainable.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Between 16-20% of Americans now live in poverty." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638260" handle="Bobb1elewi1s" hashes=""]If the 39 percent of employers above continue to not pay a livable wage to their employees, they are going to contribute to a potential social services disaster. By some statistics, between 16 to 20 percent of Americans now live in poverty.

<p>However, I believe if employees start earning a livable wage, it will strengthen the economy -- locally and nationally -- by virtue of these additional funds being used to consume goods and services. This will create increased revenues for both the public and private sector.</p>

<p>Employers are starting to wake up. Costco figured this out some time ago. They pay a livable wage and are not only profitable, but remain competitive. Henry Ford, the automaker, figured this out a long time ago: he paid his employees enough so they could afford to purchase his cars.</p>
