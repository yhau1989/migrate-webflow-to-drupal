<p>With International Women’s Day this past weekend, across the world there were displays of support for women. In Montevideo, Uruguay, the government <a href="http://www.subrayado.com.uy/Site/noticia/31491/el-correo-presento-sello-en-homenaje-a-luisa-cuesta" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated</a> a stamp to Luisa Cuesta, who has fought for truth and justice in the country. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, restaurants gave female patrons <a href="http://www.revistaohlala.com/1667866-dia-de-la-mujer-sali-con-tus-amigas-y-aprovecha-los-descuentos" rel="noopener noreferrer">discounts</a> on their meals. And in the U.S., there were various celebrations, including Hillary Clinton’s statement <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/03/07/hillary-clinton-says-equality-for-women-is-the-great-unfinished-business-of-the-21st-century/" rel="noopener noreferrer">before</a> the United Nations where she asserted that equality for women is “the great unfinished business of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.”</p>

[social_blockquote quote="In Rwanda, women comprise almost 60% of their Congress, while in the U.S. it is only 18%." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638770" handle="dsharnak" hashes=""]While the holiday was celebrated around the world, the U.S. is a striking example where women’s equality, particularly in Congress, is still suffering. In Rwanda, women <p><a href="http://wilsoncenter.tumblr.com/post/53372435597/what-do-rwanda-afghanistan-and-iraq-beat-america" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprise</a> almost 60 percent of their congress, while in the U.S. it is only 18 percent.</p>

<p>However, across the country, the level of representation varies. Ranking at the bottom are Iowa and Mississippi, two states that have never elected a woman as governor or to Congress. However, Vermont, and Delaware have also never sent a women to Congress, but have had female governors.</p>

<p>This year, Iowa has <a href="http://www.omaha.com/article/20140303/NEWS/140309685/1707" rel="noopener noreferrer">six</a> women on the primary ballot and hopes to shift their female-less record.</p>

<p>While California has the greatest number of congressional seats, they also <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30261.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">have</a> the best record for electing women. The state has elected a total of 37 women to Congress. The next 4 states to round out the top 5 are New York, Illinois, Florida, and Ohio, in that order.</p>

<p><em><strong>(The full ranking can be found <a href="#femalereps" rel="noopener noreferrer">below</a>.)</strong></em></p>

[social_link quote="To date, 298 women have either been elected or appointed to the U.S. Congress" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638770" handle="" hashes=""] , starting with Jeannette Rankin in Montana for the 1917-1919 term. Montana has yet to elect another female representative.

<p>The women have split along party lines at 194 Democrats and 104 Republicans, while most of them -- 254 of the 298 -- served in the House of Representatives.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The U.S. ranks 77th in the world by percentage of legislative seats held by women." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638770" handle="dsharnak" hashes=""]The U.S. <p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/events/2013/03/07/quotas-women-government/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranks</a> 77<sup>th</sup> in the world by percentage of legislative seats held by women.</p>

<p>Possible reasons for this discrepancy vary. A recent report by American University <a href="http://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/2012-Men-Rule-Report-web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that the “fundamental reason for women’s under-representation is that they do not run for office. There is a substantial gap in political ambition; men tend to have it and women don’t.”</p>

<p>Some commentators also ascribe the gap to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2010/11/the-exchange-rebecca-traister.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexist media coverage</a>.</p>

<p>Various political organizations across the country are dedicated to training women to run for office and decrease the gender gap such as <a href="http://www.emergeamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emerge</a>, <a href="http://emilyslist.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily’s List</a>, and <a href="http://electwomen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elect Women</a>, among others.</p>

<p>So far, their efforts have had some effect as the current Congress currently has the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/us/first-day-of-113th-congress-brings-more-women-to-capitol.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest</a> female representation in U.S. history. Iowa , launching its own efforts such as <a href="http://50-50in2020.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">50/50 in 2020</a>, hopes to add to that number in 2014 and end their dearth of female representatives to date.</p>
