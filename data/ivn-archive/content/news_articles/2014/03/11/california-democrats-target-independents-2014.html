[social_blockquote quote="In 51 out of 58 CA counties, the partisan groups are losing the battle." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295638756" handle="@PaulMitche11" hashes=""]The once predominantly blue map of California is changing shades, with new registrants in California overwhelmingly deciding not to align with a political party. In fact, since the 2012 general election, 47% of new registrants are not affiliated with the Republican or Democratic Party, making nonpartisan voters the fastest growing group in California.

<p>"In 51 out of 58 counties, the partisan groups are losing the battle," Paul Mitchell emphasized at the Voter Trends Panel discussion at the California Democratic State Convention in Los Angeles.</p>
<h4><em><strong>What does this mean for campaigning in the state?</strong></em></h4>
<p>"We've got to stop just targeting Democrats," Mitchell, president of Redistricting Partners and Vice President of Political Data Inc., advised a group of eager Democratic delegates, volunteers, and community organizers.</p>

<p>Instead, he focused his attention on discussing a new categorization of California voters, a group he identified as "DemPlus." This "Plus," as explained on the Political Data Inc. blog, "signifies that the voter is either a member of that partisanship, or acts like it.&nbsp; This uses data such as partisan donations and history of pulling a partisan ballot."</p>

<p>If a voter has donated to a Democratic candidate in a recent election, then he or she will vote for a Democrat in future elections, he argues.</p>

<p>Categorizing voters who choose not to be categorized by a particular political party, however, ignores the changing political attitudes of California voters.</p>

<p>Since 1997, the number of voters identifying as No Party Preference is up almost <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/10/democrats-optomistic-on-california-political-landscape-in-2014/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 percent</a>. Nationally, voters have repeatedly expressed their discontent with Congress, with approval ratings hitting all-time lows in 2013.</p>

<p>Just <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/167024/record-low-say-own-representative-deserves-election.aspx?utm_source=add_this&amp;utm_medium=addthis.com&amp;utm_campaign=sharing#.UuJ9tRAJWuA.twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer">17 percent</a> say they would re-elect their representative to Congress, yet party bosses continue to endorse and fund incumbents across the state of California.</p>

<p>Voters are increasingly registering as No Party Preference because they feel like the two major political parties no longer represent them.</p>
<h4><b>Targeting this group of voters along-side registered Democrats with the same Democratic Get Out the Vote information does not ensure they will vote for a Democrat on the ballot.</b></h4>
<p>Why? Because these voters do not make decisions based on the (D) or (R) designation next to a candidate's name on the ballot. They are not party loyalists and it is <a href="http://www.thirdway.org/publications/504" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistically proven</a> they not vote along party lines.</p>

<p>As California's electorate continues to shift, campaigns should shift their strategies to better appeal to the nonpartisan voters in the state. These voters have made a conscious decision <em>not</em> to be placed in the same group as registered Democratic or Republican voters. Campaigns should listen.</p>
