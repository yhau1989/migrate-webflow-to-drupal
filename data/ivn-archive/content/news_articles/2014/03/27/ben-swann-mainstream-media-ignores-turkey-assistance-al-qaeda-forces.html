<p>Did you know Turkey recently shot down a Syrian fighter jet for allegedly violating Turkey's airspace? No? Neither did most people. It is a story that hasn't gotten much coverage here at home. Maybe it is simply because cable news networks -- colloquially known as the mainstream media -- don't think it is major news (read: ratings driving news). However, according to independent investigative journalist <a href="http://benswann.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Swann</a>, it may be bigger than many people realize.</p>

<p>While prime-time viewership for cable news is on the <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/26/cable-news-loses-11-prime-time-audience-2013/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">decline</a>, millions of people still tune in to the mainstream media to stay updated on current events because even though most of what is discussed on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC is either sensationalized talking points or knee jerk, "throwing darts with a blind fold on" speculation, many people don't have the time or resources to expand their daily sources for news.</p>

<p>So, why is this story important and what did the mainstream media miss? It doesn't seem too unusual that a sovereign nation would respond in the way Turkey did if a foreign jet entered into its airspace without authorization. The issue, according to Swann, is not so black and white because the key is where the plane was shot down.</p>

<p>The incident, which occurred on Sunday, happened near the northern border town Kesab, which is located right on the Turkey-Syria border. It is an important crossing point between the two countries and militia forces associated with al-Qaeda and other similar extremist groups have battled Syrian troops for control of it since Friday.</p>

<p>Put in a certain context, it may be a little more than just a coincidence that Turkey shot down a Syrian fighter jet in the same area. Kesab is the last border crossing point Syria still has any resemblance of control over and Syrian officials have accused Turkey of assisting extremist forces to make it easier for al-Qaeda to enter Syria.</p>
