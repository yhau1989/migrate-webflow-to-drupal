<p>For decades, the American prison system has grown in size and shape.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/massincarceration_problems.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the ACLU</a>, the U.S. represents 5 percent of the world's population, but holds claim to 25 percent of the world's prison population.1 out of 99 adults are living behind bars, and 1 out of 15 African-Americans are imprisoned. Further, 1 out of 13 African-Americans cannot legally vote because of laws which deny ex-felons the right to vote.</p>

<p>The obvious ethnic disparities in the prison population highlights the injustice found within the U.S. system, and how little we have looked to address the socioeconomic disparities and racially-biased laws which lead to the mass incarceration of minorities.</p>

<p>Statistics on the ethnic disparities within the system make a strong point. However, it's also worth investigating the beneficiaries of the U.S. prison system to understand why there are more African-Americans in prison or on probation than there were slaves in 1850.</p>

<p>U.S. taxpayers pay $69 billion every year to maintain prisons. Rather than constructing ways to reform the justice system, the government decided to outsource prisons to private companies.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

[social_blockquote quote="For-profit prisons help explain the&nbsp;700%&nbsp;increase in prison population since 1970." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295640171" handle="@lpb347" hashes=""]

<p>One of the largest for-profit private prison companies, Corrections Corporations of America (CCA), said in a 2010 <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/03/14/meet-the-private-prison-lobby/" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that “any changes [in the laws] with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.”</p>

<p>An ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/banking-bondage-private-prisons-and-mass-incarceration" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> found that the top two private prison companies received around $3 billion in revenue, and that nearly half of the detained immigrants in the U.S. are in private prisons.</p>

<p>The morality and legitimacy of private prisons comes into serious question as they lobby to manipulate the criminal justice system into a system of profiteering.</p>

<p>The already established ethnic inequalities within the U.S. need to be addressed and fixed. Unfortunately, the incorporation of private companies into the justice system has since furthered a system of repression of immigrants and minorities.</p>
