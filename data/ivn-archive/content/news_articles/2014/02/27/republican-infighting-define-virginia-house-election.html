[advertisement title="" type="outset"]With Republican U.S. Representative Frank Wolf (R-10) retiring, the battle over who will take up his seat in Congress for Virginia's northern 10th Congressional District has shown signs that it may divide mainstream and tea party conservatives.

<p>Ahead of their April 26 firehouse primary, the already-crowded Republican field features 9 contenders, who were required to formally file last week.</p>

<p>Of these, analysts say Del. Barbara Comstock emerges as the Republican establishment favorite, with the Virginia state delegate leading other candidates with choice endorsements and capturing media attention just across the Beltway.</p>

<p>Writing for the New Republic, a right-leaning publication, Mona Charen <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/363441/primer-conservative-winner-mona-charen" rel="noopener noreferrer">dubbed</a> Comstock a “conservative winner” from which other conservative candidates could learn as women’s issues remain on the radar for the 2014 midterm election.</p>

<p>“If conservatives want to win elections and not just preen about their ideological purity, they should study Comstock,” she wrote, going on to call the state delegate a “conservative… any right-winger could desire – pro-free enterprise, pro-life, and pro-second amendment.”</p>

<p>The New Republic fanfare helped raise Comstock’s profile, but may have done little to sway the 10th district’s tea party base, which -- like its national constituency -- remains bitterly opposed to Obama administration initiatives and skeptical of the more mainstream elements in the Republican Party.</p>

<p>One Washington Post story <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/del-barbara-comstock-under-fire-from-right-and-left-in-race-to-succeed-rep-wolf/2014/02/18/9d3c0338-94da-11e3-83b9-1f024193bb84_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted</a> several attendees from a Winchester Tea Party meeting with Comstock in February as calling the state delegate a “moderate” who “claimed to be a conservative.”</p>

<p>The divide is one that Democrats will likely use to bill the election as one more referendum on the rift between establishment Republicans and their grassroots base.</p>

<p>Their own field is smaller for the same congressional district that switched to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, but already boasts an early edge in fundraising prowess.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2014&amp;id=VA10&amp;spec=N" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSecrets.org</a>, Democrat John Foust, a Fairfax county supervisor, reported raising $217,487 in December last year, with more than $200,000 in cash on hand. His rival, attorney Richard Bolger, another Democratic challenger, emerged with $105,945 from the last quarter.</p>

<p>That could put both of the Democrats on track to raise as much by November as the retiring congressman, a seventeen-term incumbent who brought in more than $1 million to fend off challenges in 2012.</p>

<p>Even so, the congressional district could still favor a Republican candidate in 2014. Redistricting from the 2010 census stood to add more conservative-leaning districts to VA-10, and Wolf captured nearly <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Virginia's_10th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014" rel="noopener noreferrer">60 percent</a> of the general election vote two years ago.</p>

<p>Both parties will officially nominate their candidates in April, with Democrats set to choose theirs at a convention. The filing deadline for Democratic candidates is March 11.</p>
