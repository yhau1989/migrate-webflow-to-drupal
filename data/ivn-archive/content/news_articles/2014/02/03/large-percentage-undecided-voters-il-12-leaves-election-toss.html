[advertisement title="" type="outset"]In Illinois, Democrats hold 12 out of 18 U.S. congressional districts. In the 12th district, one <p><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/hotline-on-call/i-the-hotline-i-s-house-race-rankings-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-20140106" rel="noopener noreferrer">chosen</a> by <em>National Journal</em> as likely to flip, Republicans are hoping to make the switch happen.</p>

<p>The 12th district <a href="http://precinctmaps.com/?page_id=2109" rel="noopener noreferrer">stretches</a> from East St. Louis in the west -- with a chunk removed in the middle -- to the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers in the south. The district leans Democrat, is largely agricultural, but might be leaving its incumbent vulnerable.</p>

<p>The incumbent is Democrat <a href="http://enyart.house.gov/about/full-biography" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Enyart</a>, a Belleville lawyer and former Adjutant General of the Illinois National Guard. A first-time candidate in 2012, Enyart won over 50% of the vote despite a Green Party candidate receiving over five percent.</p>

<p>After going with an occasionally under-performing <a href="http://www.rplumber.com/about/about-us.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">lumber</a> business scion, 30-year-old <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/campaign-2012/candidates/jason-plummer-61669/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Plummer</a>, in 2012, Republicans are counting on State Representative and Republican Mike Bost of Murphysboro.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/29/illinois-state-rep-mike-bost-to-enter-us-house-race-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bost</a>, a former firefighter and veteran of the U.S. Marines, is perhaps best known for a pair of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Mike+Bost&amp;sm=3" rel="noopener noreferrer">tirades</a> on the floor of the General Assembly. One of them <a href="http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/20/richard-sherman-rant/" rel="noopener noreferrer">earned</a> him the runner-up spot on CNN's list of "Celebrity Flip-Outs."</p>

[social_blockquote quote="In 2012, Bill Enyart won IL-12 with just over 50% of the vote, meaning the seat is vulnerable." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295636139" handle="" hashes=""]Hoping to cultivate an image as someone fed-up, rather than as a potential hot-head, Bost embraces the attention his rants have brought him, <p><a href="http://www.bnd.com/2014/01/22/3017548/so-illinois-gop-congressional.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, "I thought I was going to be No. 1" on the list.</p>

<p>Antics aside, Bost is a more seasoned politician than Plummer, winning his first election to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1994. Bost <a href="http://thesouthern.com/news/local/murphysboro-state-legislator-says-it-s-time/article_2b79f6a6-f679-11e2-9f92-0019bb2963f4.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> he is seeking the seat to fight for jobs, against over-regulation, and a solution for immigration.</p>

<p>In his first term, Enyart has not caused much controversy and has <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/search/result?q=Enyart&amp;search_congress[113]=113&amp;search_bills=1&amp;search_people=1&amp;search_committees=1&amp;search_issues=1&amp;search_comments=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> with his party almost 90 percent of the time. One of his bills, which is designed to improve job training skills -- the <a href="http://enyart.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/congressman-enyart-promotes-new-jobs-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">JOBS Act</a> -- has <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1436" rel="noopener noreferrer">attracted</a> only one cosponsor. However, a memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) last November <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/189083-nrcc-chairmans-memo-obamacare-will-drive-2014-house-elections" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed</a> that the incumbent had only a 25 percent approval rating in his district.</p>

<p>In an otherwise economically-depressed region, the biggest <a href="http://www.scott.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=259" rel="noopener noreferrer">employer</a> in the district is Scott Air Force Base in Shiloh. Each candidate has made the base a part of the campaign. Enyart <a href="http://thesouthern.com/news/mike-bost-will-seek-the-th-district-congressional-seat/article_7048ad06-f8cf-11e2-9fb8-0019bb2963f4.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on Bost's announcement:</p>
<blockquote>"The people of Southern Illinois sent me to Congress to fight for jobs, protect Medicare and Social Security, and ensure the future of Scott Air Force Base."</blockquote>
<p>Bost alluded to military spending, and by implication Scott, in his <a href="http://thesouthern.com/news/local/murphysboro-state-legislator-says-it-s-time/article_2b79f6a6-f679-11e2-9f92-0019bb2963f4.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> last summer:</p>
<blockquote>"I was around when (former president) Jimmy Carter cut the military. That's why we failed to save the hostages in Iran. . . . We were using equipment at that time we had left over from Vietnam."</blockquote>
<p>National politics, such as the ineffective introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), will likely play a part in the election. If Bost is thought to have a reasonable chance to unseat Enyart, money from national groups may pour into the race. Although a supporter of the health care plan, Enyart <a href="http://votesmart.org/bill/17168/45611/110744/authority-for-mandate-delay-act#.UuoDxLSTK8A" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> in 2013 for a one year delay in the implementation of the ACA.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Rep. Enyart has voted with his party almost 90% of the time." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295636139" handle="CarlWicklander" hashes=""]Early polling has not shown much. A May 2013 NRSC poll, released before Bost officially announced, <p><a href="http://www.battlegroundpolling.com/?p=1181" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed</a> the Republican leading Enyart 33-27 -- leaving over 40 percent undecided. A potential wildcard in the race is <a href="http://thesouthern.com/news/bradshaw-to-seek-th-congressional-seat/article_d1d10808-4c25-11e3-a386-001a4bcf887a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Bradshaw</a>, the Green Party candidate, who took a full 5 percent of the vote in 2012.</p>

<p>One factor that may play into Enyart's favor is that his base is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_East" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro East</a> area, the most populous region of the district, while Bost, who is from the much less populated <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http://ilhousedems.com/redistricting/2011-maps/Senate_Bill_1177_Amendment_2/ab9Plan0520.kmz&amp;aq=&amp;sll=39.797399,-89.664939&amp;sspn=0.014294,0.018132&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=7" rel="noopener noreferrer">south</a>, has to <a href="http://www.duquoin.com/article/20130729/NEWS/130729466/1001/NEWS?template=printart" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduce himself</a> to the larger electorate. However, as John Jackson of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute <a href="http://www.wsiltv.com/news/local/Enyart-Announces-Re-Election-Campaign-233533911.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out</a>, 2014 may be a better year than others because, "The party that controls the White House almost always loses seats in the House in the off-year elections."</p>

<p>Republican Mike Bost may need that trend to hold up to pull off the victory. In a district that only voted for President Obama's re-election by a margin of 1.5 percentage points, Bost may have a chance.</p>
