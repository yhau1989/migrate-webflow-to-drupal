[advertisement title="" type="outset"]As the 2014 midterm elections approach, parties and candidates are organizing, and potential swing districts are already in campaign mode.

<p>One such <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/IL/13" rel="noopener noreferrer">district</a>, the Illinois 13th, <a href="http://precinctmaps.com/?page_id=2112" rel="noopener noreferrer">stretches</a> from Collinsville in the west and south up through central Illinois and includes Springfield, as well as Bloomington and Champaign-Urbana.</p>

<p>The incumbent is Republican U.S. Representative Rodney Davis, a 44-year-old from Taylorville. The 2014 election marks Davis' first time defending his seat.</p>

<p>After years of serving as a congressional aide and a couple of previous failed bids for lower offices, he was selected at the 2012 Illinois Republican Convention to be the party's nominee for the race in the 13th district. He was chosen when the previous incumbent, Tim Johnson, retired after that year's primary.</p>

<p>Davis' road to re-election faces two stops: the March 18 primary against former Miss America winner Erika Harold and the presumptive Democratic candidate, former judge Ann Callis, in the general election.</p>

<p>Harold <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/06/10/in-illinois-district-13-erika-harold-strikes-positive-tone-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> her campaign last summer and provoked immediate backlash from her own party. In one notorious incident, a county GOP chief, who later resigned over his comments, <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Blog/2013/06/21/GOP-official-resigns-after-calling-Erika-Harold-street-walker/6321371819397/" rel="noopener noreferrer">referred</a> to Harold as a "street walker" working for the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>In a more restrained assessment, another Republican county chairperson <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/primary-fight-for-congress-shakes-up-gop-in-illinois/article_271ce073-ef64-5c0f-9b67-13e8b1d54181.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> the issue was not that Harold was running, but only that she had challenged an uncontroversial incumbent:</p>
<blockquote>"She could have selected any other office (with a Democratic incumbent) and she would have had everyone behind her. . . . We always prefer that we don't have (in-party) candidates run against our incumbents unless they've done a bad job. And Rodney Davis has by no means done a bad job."</blockquote>
<p>Despite some fundraising troubles, and holding together a campaign staff, she has acquired endorsements from former presidential candidate <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/illinois/government-and-politics/elections/herman-cain-to-campaign-for-former-miss-america/article_65269156-8239-11e3-8a7d-001a4bcf887a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Herman Cain</a> and Family-PAC chairman <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/02/caprio-officially-backs-harold-over-davis-in-the-13th-congressional-district.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Caprio</a>. Davis has safely secured the support of the party establishment.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Illinois' 8.6% unemployment rate is higher than the national avg. of almost 7%." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295636897" handle="" hashes=""]The Democrats have already begun investing in the effort to flip the seat into their column. So far, Callis has <p><a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/news/national/government-and-politics/elections/callis-war-chest-tops-for-congressional-race/article_2976b946-7da3-11e3-8ce8-001a4bcf887a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised</a> over $500,000. A true swing district, Callis has been <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/kevin-mcdermott/dem-congressional-candidate-callis-lukewarm-on-obama-quinn/article_bdeb20cd-1f0f-564e-9c38-18f89a64e4a1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">cautious</a> about whether she would accept support from Governor Pat Quinn and President Barack Obama -- leaders in her party. In 2012, Mitt Romney <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-11/vulnerable-republicans-brace-for-hard-post-shutdown-races.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">won</a> the district with 48.9 percent to Obama's 48.6 percent.</p>

<p>In her statement announcing her candidacy, Callis <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-07/callis-announces-run-13th-district.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> she is "frustrated" Washington is not "delivering for the middle class." Illinois' <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">unemployment</a> rate of 8.6 percent is still higher than the national average of almost 7 percent.</p>

<p>Davis is considered one of 2014's more vulnerable incumbents. <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/hotline-on-call/i-the-hotline-i-s-house-race-rankings-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-20140106" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Journal</a> and <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/roll_calls_10_most_vulnerable_house_members_revealed-228867-1.html?pos=hmp?pos=lpolmr" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roll Call</a> have both identified the 13th district as one that could flip this year.</p>

<p>Davis <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/house/il/illinois_13th_district_davis_vs_gill-3307.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">won</a> in 2012 by only about one thousand votes out of more than 294,000 votes cast. An <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/john-hartman-independent-for-congress-illinois-s-13th-congressional-district" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent</a> candidate also received over 7 percent. The three-way race meant Davis won the election on less than 47 percent of the vote and will likely need to spend 2014 proving that he has a mandate and deserves another term.</p>
