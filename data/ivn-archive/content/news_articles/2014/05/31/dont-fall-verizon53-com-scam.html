<p>Someone I know got a call on her cellphone from a person who claimed to be from Verizon. The person claimed to be a representative of Verizon.</p>

<p>The caller asked her&nbsp;to "claim a $53 credit" from Verizon Wireless by logging into http://verizon53.com. When a person goes to the website, it appears to be an official Verizon website.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="This site has all the makings of a scam and mimics a popular one shut down in late 2013: vzw53.com." author=""]When someone logs into the site, the website asks the user to give up private information, including their Verizon account number, their phone number, their pin, and the last 4 digits of their social security number.

<p>This site has all the makings of a scam and mimics a popular one&nbsp;shut down in late 2013: vzw53.com.</p>

<p>The parties involved in the scam are in violation of international, state, and federal laws.</p>

<p>We searched the registration information for the website. The website is registered in Panama. Other details are blocked by private registration protection provided by a private registration company, http://Enom.com.</p>

<p>Potential legal remedies that may be available to victims of the scam are currently under review. If you had your information compromised by this scam, email&nbsp;contact@ivn.us&nbsp;for the latest information.</p>
