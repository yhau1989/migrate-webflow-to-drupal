<p>Last month, in a bold attempt to fix out-of-control campaign financing, corruption activist Lawrence Lessig <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/04/09/lawrence-lessig-launch-mayday-campaign-end-corruption-dc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> an experiment to raise enough money by 2016 to install&nbsp;a majority in Congress&nbsp;that is committed to comprehensive reform. On May 1, that experiment <a href="https://mayone.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">went live</a>, raising over $200,000 in less than 24 hours. That is almost a quarter of the project's first goal of $1 million, putting it&nbsp;on track to meet the&nbsp;target in less than a week's time.</p>

<p>What is so remarkable is that the site&nbsp;was built almost entirely by volunteers and zero dollars were&nbsp;spent promoting it. This&nbsp;means that the word is spreading entirely through social media, lending the Super PAC more credibility as a true grassroots movement. To maintain that credibility, Lessig also promises that no dollars will go toward overhead or consulting fees and that instead, all funds will go toward winning elections.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Our democracy is held hostage by the funders of campaigns." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295642183" handle="Lessig" hashes=""]In 2014, the Super PAC will seek to raise a total of $12 million for targeting 5 U.S. House of Representatives seats in an attempt to learn what works and what does not. If successful, the effort will be ramped up to provide a full on assault in 2016 to win the other&nbsp;<p><span>213 House and 60 Senate seats required to ensure that comprehensive reform is passed.</span></p>

<p>Once each target is reached, Lessig promises&nbsp;to have the amount matched by wealthy donors in order to amplify the dollars contributed by ordinary citizens. When asked if he could reveal who those donors were in a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24ibwn/iama_lawrence_lessig_law_professor_activist/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit IamA</a>, Lessig responded, "<span>Not until they've done it. All will be transparent.</span>"</p>

<p>"Yes, we want to spend big money to end the influence of big money. Ironic, I get it, but embrace the irony," Lessig says in the video introduction.</p>

<p>In attempt to mitigate further criticism,&nbsp;Lessig argues that a Super PAC based on the contributions of millions of Americans will be more effective than one that is run by a handful of billionaires.</p>

<p>"Our democracy is held hostage by the funders of campaigns," explains Lessig, "we are going to pay the ransom, and get it back."</p>
