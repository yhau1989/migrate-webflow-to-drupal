<p>As a non-presidential election year, voter turnout in 2014 is not likely to be very high. Congressional approval remains <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166838/congress-job-approval-starts-2014.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">below</a> 15 percent. North Carolina voter turnout is expected to be <a href="http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2014/05/06/low-turnout-expected/" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than</a>&nbsp;20&nbsp;percent. If recent <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/13/voter-turnout-drops-during-2012-primary-season/" rel="noopener noreferrer">trends</a> continue, the average primary turnout this election will hover around the&nbsp;<a href="http://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/report/national-primary-turnout-hits-new-record-low" rel="noopener noreferrer">record low</a> of 17.3 percent in 2012.</p>

<p>In light of these dim numbers, a group of independent voters is organizing what they call a "Voting Rights are Primary" campaign. They will be picketing and distributing information&nbsp;outside of polling locations&nbsp;in states across the nation that have closed primary system. In a closed primary, voters are required to register with a party in order to participate, despite having to fund these primaries with their tax dollars.</p>

<p>Jacqueline Salit, president of IndependentVoting.org, a co-founding member of the <a href="http://endpartisanship.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EndPartisanship</a> coalition, says that one explanation for the lack of participation stems from election laws that prevent non-affiliated voters -- about 43 percent of the voting population -- from voting in primary elections.</p>
<blockquote>“The midterm elections are not just about who goes to Washington. They’re about who sends them there" said Salit in a statement. "We need an open process where every voter has the right to participate in a meaningful way.”</blockquote>
<p>The "Voting Rights are Primary" campaign&nbsp;is part of a larger effort to inform and activate the fastest growing segment of the electorate: independent voters.</p>
