<p>Foreclosures and bankruptcy are obvious glaring points that you want to avoid. If they do happen, though, they will show up on a credit report. Many wonder how long these penalties show up on a report.</p>

<p>There are different circumstances surrounding both of them. Let’s break it down to find out how long these will show up on a credit report.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[heading title="Bankruptcy" subtitle=""]

[social_blockquote quote="It can take 7-10 years for bankruptcy to be removed from a credit report." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295642089" handle="" hashes=""]While bankruptcy can help avoid deeper debts, it makes it difficult to establish new credit. This is due mainly in part to the length of time it shows up on a credit report.

<p>It can take 7-10 years for it to be removed, depending on the filing. For Chapter 13 bankruptcies, there is a 7-year waiting period. This is a bit shorter than a Chapter 7, which lasts for 10.</p>

<p>The reason for that is because Chapter 13 bankruptcies require payments to be made toward the debt. It’s important to consider all of the other possibilities before declaring bankruptcy.</p>

[heading title="Foreclosure" subtitle=""]

<p>Once a foreclosure has been performed by a lender, it is sent to all of the major credit bureaus. It is lumped into the same category in a public record as bankruptcy. It remains on a credit report for up to 7 years.</p>

<p>Although the exact credit score hit depends on a lot of different factors, foreclosures are considered to have the biggest negative impact. It will be very difficult to secure any other lines of credit while a foreclosure is present on a credit report. However, after a couple of years and some careful rebuilding, there can be hope.</p>

[heading title="What is the foreclosure process?" subtitle=""]

[social_blockquote quote="2-3 months after non-payments on a mortgage, it will be considered as having a default status." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295642089" handle="" hashes=""]Between 2-3 months after non-payments on a mortgage bill, the mortgage will be considered as having a default status. The resident is then forced to evacuate the home in a given time span.

<p>This can be one of the most devastating things for anyone to go through. Not only does the home get taken away, but the credit score reflects negatively in a big way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 [heading title="Are loans still possible?" subtitle=""]<p><b></b></p>

<p>It likely won’t be anytime within the first two years, but it is possible to secure credit with a bankruptcy or foreclosure on a credit report. However, you will likely notice that the interest rates will be much higher in this circumstance.</p>

<p>A lot of loans will also depend on the economy at the time. If there are strong performances in terms of revenue from lenders, it becomes more likely. However, if lenders are only granting loans to customers with high credit scores, it becomes harder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[heading title="What if the time frame has passed and it is still in the report?" subtitle=""]

<p>It is illegal for mortgage lenders to list a foreclosure after the 7 years have passed. If it is still on there after that time, you can directly ask for it to be taken off by the credit bureaus. The request has to be in writing for it to be valid. Make sure to check your credit report regularly to make sure there are no errors involved.</p>

<p>If you have been foreclosed on or declared bankruptcy, it is best to be patient. It takes time for the credit report to be healed, but there are always options in which to rebuild your credit.</p>
