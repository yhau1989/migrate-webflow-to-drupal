<p>Legislation that would legalize marijuana for medical dedications in New York cleared its <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/medical-marijuana-legalization-bill-passed-state-senate-article-1.1799935" rel="noopener noreferrer">first obstacle</a> in the state Senate on Tuesday by passing the Health Committee in a 9-8 vote. A sole Republican, Sen. William Larkin of Orange County, joined eight Democrats to approve the bill.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Bill to legalize medical marijuana in NY passed its first committee in 9-8 vote." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295643117" handle="" hashes=""]The bill’s champion, independent Democrat Diane Savino, claims that if said legislation is permitted to come to the Senate floor for a vote, that she has rustled up enough support from both Democrats and Republicans to effectively pass her Compassionate Care Act.

<p>In order for Savino’s baby to reach the Senate chambers for a vote, it had to first traverse the 17-member Health Committee, which is chaired by the less-than-supportive-of-marijuana-legalization Sen. Kemp Hannon.</p>

<p>The legislation’s sponsors declare the bill's approval in the committee as a historic step for this type of bill. The Compassionate Care Act now advances to the Senate’s Finance Committee.</p>

<p>It’s been reported that Governor Cuomo is willing to consider<a href="http://the420times.com/2014/01/new-york-governor-to-announce-plans-to-legalize-medical-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> any bill</a> passed by the state’s Legislature.</p>
