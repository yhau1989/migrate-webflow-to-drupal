<p>On Tuesday, June 3, San Diego voters will weigh in on Propositions B and C -- a set of community plan updates for Barrio Logan already passed by the San Diego City Council&nbsp;last year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2014/06/03/ca/sd/prop/B/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prop B</a>&nbsp;would create a buffer between residential and industrial land use, separating neighborhoods and schools from the the community's shipyards.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2014/06/03/ca/sd/prop/C/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prop C</a>&nbsp;would amend the Ordinances to allow for the implementation of the Barrio Logan Community Plan,&nbsp;so votes for or against the propositions&nbsp;are typically aligned.</p>

[heading title="Pros" subtitle="Yes Vote"]

<p><em>A "Yes Vote" would implement the approved&nbsp;Barrio Logan Community Plan</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Improve health and air quality for children in Barrio Logan, who are <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/03/barrio-logan-plan-props-b-c-childrens-health/" rel="noopener noreferrer">three times</a> as likely to visit the ER&nbsp;from asthma-related symptoms</li>
	<li>Creates a buffer zone between heavy industry and chemical-use facilities and neighborhoods</li>
	<li>Protects existing businesses and home owners by including a Grandfather clause</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/03/barrio-logan-plan-props-b-c-childrens-health/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creates 5,000 jobs</a> due to the increase in industrial and commercial acreage</li>
</ul>

[heading title="Cons" subtitle="No Vote"]

<p><em>A "No Vote" Would strike down the approved Barrio Logan Community Plan</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Increases overall damages from greenhouse gasses because of proposed neighborhood's&nbsp;proximity to the I-5 freeway and expected population growth</li>
	<li>Threatens expansion of&nbsp;San Diego's Shipyard&nbsp;industry&nbsp;in Barrio Logan</li>
	<li>Increases costs for&nbsp;the shipyard industry in Barrio Logan by potentially&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/may/06/san-diego-voters-weigh-barrio-logan-zoning-proposi/" rel="noopener noreferrer">restricting</a>&nbsp;hours of operation for shipbuilders and ship&nbsp;maintenance facilities</li>
</ul>

<p><em>While the Barrio Logan Community Plan passed a City Council vote, opponents&nbsp;waged a well-funded campaign to put the issue to a city-wide vote.</em></p>

[/outset][heading title="Battle Between Community &amp;&nbsp;Economic Interest" subtitle=""]

<p>In this&nbsp;conflict&nbsp;between neighborhood well-being and economic interest, those in favor Propositions B and C are concerned that the&nbsp;<a href="http://voiceofsandiego.org/2012/12/27/barrio-logan-grapples-with-its-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer">dangerous mix</a> of land use threatens the health of all community members, especially children.</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp;California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development,&nbsp;visits to&nbsp;the ER&nbsp;due to&nbsp;asthma-related health issues in Barrio Logan are nearly&nbsp;<a href="http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/12/10/fact-check-asthma-in-barrio-logan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">three times the county average</a>.</p>

<p>Councilmember David Alvarez, who&nbsp;has experienced the effects of pollution first hand, openly supports the proposals.</p>
<blockquote><strong>“As a resident who grew up with asthma from polluted neighborhoods and who has family and friends working in the shipyards, I urge voters to support B and C to achieve our goals of protecting our children’s health while allowing our economy to grow.”&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>
[social_blockquote quote="The Barrio Logan Community Plan&nbsp;would be the&nbsp;first community plan update for Barrio Logan since 1978." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295642492" handle="" hashes=""]Opponents of the Barrio Logan Community Plan, however, are concerned that these buffer zones could mark the beginning of the end for the shipping industry in the area.

<p><span>Chris Wahl, spokesman for Shipyards industry executives,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/sep/17/battle-barrio-logan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledges</a> the need to separate land use, "but it can’t be at the expense of the shipyards and their future,” he argues.</p>

<p>Ballot language goes so far as to call the plan&nbsp;"a dangerous first step toward elimination of San Diego's shipyards,"&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/may/06/san-diego-voters-weigh-barrio-logan-zoning-proposi/" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPBS reports</a>, to which proponents have disputed.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to encroach on industry cause those jobs are good jobs and we want to keep them," <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/sep/17/battle-barrio-logan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alvarez points out</a>, citing the inclusion of a Grandfather clause aimed to allow&nbsp;businesses and homeowners to keep their property, although it prevents them from expanding.</p>

<p>If passed, <strong>Proposition B</strong> and <strong>Proposition C</strong>&nbsp;will be the first community plan update for Barrio Logan since 1978.</p>

<p>The primary election will be on June 3.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yesonbc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes on Props B, C</a></p>
