[advertisement title="" type="outset"]For any organization to be effective and efficient, to successfully do what those funding its existence expect it to do in return for their investment, takes a strong leader. This person must be able to guide the organization, earning the trust and respect of both supporters and detractors, and foster decisions and actions that further the betterment of the organization, its investors, and its customers. Without this, the organization fails.

<p>Since 1981, the first year of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, there have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses" rel="noopener noreferrer">17 congressional sessions</a>. Except for the first six years of Bush II and first two years of President Obama, presidents have been faced with a split Congress or a Congress completely controlled by the opposing party. In spite of this, all were able to either advance their policies or agree to policies put forth by the opposition that both the president and members of Congress believed were best for the country -- all except President Obama and the 112<sup>th</sup> and 113<sup>th</sup> Congress.</p>

<p>The House and Senate consider legislation either by bill or joint resolution. Joint resolutions, for the most part, are less contentious and usually deal with naming buildings, approving commemorative coins, or naming a day in honor of some event. Many times, they are passed on voice vote. Bills are usually passed by roll call vote, but roll calls are also used for quorum calls and other administrative actions. So how can one really get a handle on how well Congress is doing and how the president’s leadership impacts the legislative process?</p>

<p>The best indicator I believe is the number of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php?&amp;n=PublicLaws&amp;c=97" rel="noopener noreferrer">bills signed by the president</a> into public law. Remember, going back to 1981, there have been very few instances where Congress and the White House were controlled by the same party.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan (97<sup>th</sup> – 100<sup>th</sup> Congress) 1607 bills signed; Average 402 per session</p>

<p>George H.W. Bush (101<sup>st</sup> – 102<sup>nd</sup> Congress) 835 bills signed; Average 418 per session</p>

<p>Bill Clinton (103<sup>rd</sup> – 106<sup>th</sup> Congress) 1566 bills signed; Average 392 per session</p>

<p>George W. Bush (107<sup>th</sup> – 110<sup>th</sup> Congress) 1720 bills signed; Average 430 per session *</p>

<p>Total 5728 bills signed; Average 409 bills per session</p>

<p>*6 years Republican control of Congress and White House</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Barack Obama (111<sup>th</sup> – 114<sup>th</sup> Congress) has signed 710 bills, an average of 284 per session or 31% less than the average of the four presidents who preceded him. This in spite of the fact that during the 111<sup>th</sup> Congress, the Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress, briefly with a veto-proof majority.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Barack Obama has signed 710 bills, averaging 284 per session. Notably less than his predecessors" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295636075" handle="" hashes=""]The reason for this difference, at least to me, is clear: LEADERSHIP.

<p>It takes more than a good speech or a rare one or two hour conversation over lunch or dinner. It’s fine to delegate but in doing so, there has to be a willingness to follow-up and if necessary, <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/28188/sequester-cuts-loom-but-it-doesn-t-take-rocket-science-to-stop-them" rel="noopener noreferrer">roll up your sleeves and get directly involved</a>. Above all, threats of unilateral action -- a “my way or the highway” approach -- will never work.</p>

<p>This president appears not to comprehend this. His style seems to be hands-off; his directive is all that is needed. Meetings with advisories seem at a minimum. And, his <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-2014-state-of-the-union-address-full-text/" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat</a> of using executive orders within the first couple of minutes of this year’s State of the Union address only reinforces the perception of poor leadership. The numbers I listed above validate this perception.</p>
