[/outset]Voters across America will be tuning in tonight as President Obama delivers his sixth State of the Union address.

<p>Since his last address, Edward Snowden revealed the National Security Agency's mass surveillance program, the Healthcare.gov website launched and crashed on October 1, the government shut down for 17 days, and the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, giving same-sex couples equal protection under federal law.</p>

<p>The events of 2013 warrant an explanation from our country's leader, and Obama will surely be prepared to discuss <i>some</i> of the key issues facing our country. But what about the issues important to <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>We asked our community of independent-minded voters what issues they want to see Obama discuss in tonight's State of the Union. Here are the top 5 responses.</p>

[heading title="1) NSA" subtitle="Because Obama's Proposed Reforms Fall Flat."]

<p><em>"The NSA spying and exactly HOW he intends to regulate the NSA."&nbsp;- IVN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVN" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>&nbsp;Respondent.</em></p>

<p>Despite his proposed reforms to the NSA's mass collection practices, President Obama has fallen short when it comes to justifying the program. Recent polling shows that a majority of Americans now oppose the NSA's data collection. In <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/01/21/usa-todaypew-53-oppose-nsa-data-collection/" rel="noopener noreferrer">our poll</a> of independent-minded voters, 90% of respondents said they oppose the controversial practices.</p>

[heading title="2) Green Energy" subtitle="Because Two-Thirds of Americans Want To See More Renewable Energy."]

<p><em>"The importance of protecting the environment." - IVN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVN" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>&nbsp;Respondent.
</em></p>

<p>When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, he promised 5 million green jobs if elected president. Granted, he gave himself 10 years to accomplish this goal, but reports show that green jobs have been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/13/us-usa-campaign-green-idUSBRE83C08D20120413" rel="noopener noreferrer">slow to sprout</a>, leaving some independent-minded voters questioning his commitment to green energy.</p>

[heading title="3) Jobs, Jobs, Jobs" subtitle="Because 6.7% of Americans are Still Unemployed."]

<p><em>"Getting jobs back in the U.S.A. now."&nbsp;- IVN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVN" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>&nbsp;Respondent.</em></p>

<p>While the unemployment rate is at its lowest rate in over five years, <em>all</em> Americans are feeling the pain of a slow economic recovery. Millions have even <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/01/22/job-market-still-looks-grim-despite-lower-unemployment-rate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">given up</a> looking for work altogether. By an overwhelming majority, independent-minded voters are demanding answers from President Obama.</p>

[heading title="4) The War on Drugs" subtitle="Because Support for Marijuana Legalization is At an All-Time High."]

<p><em>"How he intends to place marijuana in schedule II and remove all barriers from states who choose to legalize."&nbsp;- IVN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVN" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>&nbsp;Respondent.</em></p>

<p>Despite being legal in both Colorado and Washington state, marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug.</p>

<p><em>"A <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/04/25/why-is-marijuana-a-schedule-i-drug/" rel="noopener noreferrer">schedule I drug </a>is a dangerous substance that has no recognized medical use and that has a high potential for abuse. In addition to marijuana, heroin, LSD and ecstasy&nbsp;are schedule I substances."</em></p>

<p>President Obama recently stated in an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-marijuana-not-more-dangerous-than-alcohol/" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“I don’t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.”</blockquote>
<p>So why, as many of our readers ask, does marijuana remain a Schedule I drug?</p>

[heading title="5) Mental Health" subtitle="Because No One Else is Talking About It."]

<p><em>"The current approach to gun violence and gun policy in America isn’t working and the problem is only exacerbated by the talking heads who ignore asking real questions and having a serious discussion. Instead, they turn to overused talking points that keep America trapped in the same debate which will inevitably resurface again in the future, but will not go anywhere." - Shawn M. Griffiths, IVN Editor-in-Chief&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>With gun-related violence becoming a common topic of discussion, many conversations are reduced to partisan talking points about gun control and lack substance about underlying issues related to instances of violence -- like mental health care.</p>
