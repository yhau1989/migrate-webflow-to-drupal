<p>[pullout_blockquote quote="Social media isn't something that you do, instead you have to be social. " author="Peter Thompson"] Whether you support or oppose his controversial acts, Edward Snowden’s revelations of the <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/12/18/edward-snowden-truth-lies-and-consequences" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSA surveillance program</a> resurfaces the issue of government intrusion, and reminds us to be extra cautious when disclosing tightlipped information across different social media platforms.</p>
<p>You could be a dedicated housewife who secretly enjoys the excitement of weightlifting, a masculine energetic athletic who appreciates the art of sewing, or a Republican who believes in equal marriage. Regardless, you and your life, ranging from excitements to embarrassments, belong to you. Privacy is a personal choice. The information you choose to share should be your choice too.</p>
<p>On that note, as a Social Media Intern for IVN News – a once hyped social media butterfly and a victim of social media identity theft, I feel the urge to provide you with these five steps to help protect online privacy while interacting on different social media platforms.</p>

<h3>[heading title="1. Be Thorough" subtitle="Always Log-out"]</h3>
<p>The ease of having your passwords saved and leaving your account logged on is undeniable. However, if you consider the information linked to your social profiles worthy of privacy, the price for such tedious caution could be worth it.</p>

<h3>[heading title="2. Be On The Know" subtitle="“Friends Only”"]</h3>
<p><span>This might sound obvious, but take the extra time to get to know the privacy protection systems of your various social networks. In the </span><a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/mike-johansson/1824731/9-ways-maintain-some-privacy-social-media-web" rel="noopener noreferrer">words of Mike Johansson</a>,&nbsp;b<span>e the “Friends Only” kind of Facebook users. Only allow your friends to access your information.</span></p>
<p><em>(Note: Remember that you can’t make your entire Facebook Cover Photo Album private)</em></p>

<h3>[heading title="3. Be An FBI Agent"&nbsp;subtitle="“Encrypt Everything”"]</h3>
<p>[social_blockquote quote="You can never be too overprotective online with personal information." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295635249" handle="@simplemike7" hashes="#onlineprivacy "]&nbsp;Imagine you are an FBI agent tasked with guarding confidential data. You should encrypt all of your data-storage devices. This means using complex password and changing them often -&nbsp;<em>Not your birthday please!</em>&nbsp;Since you never know when your laptop or mobile devices might get lost or stolen, you can never be too overprotective online with personal information.</p>

<h3>[heading title="4. Be A Celebrity" subtitle="Think Twice About Add/Follow"]</h3>
<p>Facebook reports <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Facebook+Reports+87+Percent+of+Active+User+Accounts++are+Fake/article25326.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">8.7%</a> of its total profiles are fake. This means you could seriously be jeopardizing your private life just by accepting new “friends”. Imagine what a stalker/ stranger could do with the knowledge of your daily schedule, which company you are working for, and <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/02/20/social-media-crime-are-we-putting-ourselves-in-danger/" rel="noopener noreferrer">your current location</a>.</p>

<h3>[heading title="5. Be Careful…" subtitle="On what you click"]</h3>
<p>There is a high chance that any ad or promotion you see online is trying to steal your information. Be extremely wary of clicking on suspicious online advertising, gift card offers and even more cautious when entering your credit card information.</p>
