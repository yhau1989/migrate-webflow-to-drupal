<p>This past summer, a <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-august-2013/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> survey revealed that 44 percent of the participants did not realize "Obamacare" was still law, and about one-third said they had not heard anything about the insurance exchanges that are one of its central elements.</p>
