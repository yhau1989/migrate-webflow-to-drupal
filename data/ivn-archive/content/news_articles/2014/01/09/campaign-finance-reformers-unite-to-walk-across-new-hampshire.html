[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Fifteen years ago, at the age of 88,&nbsp;Doris "Granny D" Haddock began a 3,200 mile journey across the United States to advocate for campaign finance reform.&nbsp;On January 11, 2014, activists have united&nbsp;to continue her journey by walking across New Hampshire from Dixville Notch to Nashua. Their goal is to make sure every future candidate is asked just one question: <p><strong>How are you going to end corruption in Washington?</strong></p>

<p>The walk will end in Nashua, NH on January 24 -- Granny D's birthday. Along the way, well-known reformers will join the cause, including Governor Buddy Roemer, Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig, Cenk Uygur, and many others.</p>

<p>In a video produced for the event, Professor Lawrence Lessig notes that: "Right now, the most important factor in getting elected or getting re-elected&nbsp;is the amount of money that candidates raise,&nbsp;and sometimes raising money is <strong>the</strong> determining factor. Which means that in&nbsp;order to get re-elected, politicians don't have to keep voters happy; increasingly, they have to keep their funders happy first."</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Politicians don't have to keep voters happy; they have to keep their funders happy first." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295634410" handle="Lessig" hashes=""]New Hampshire is in a unique position to restore integrity, transparency, and responsibility to a broken and corrupt political system. The <p><a href="http://www.nhrebellion.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NH Rebellion</a> is a movement to leverage that opportunity because: New Hampshire holds the first presidential primary, the voters of New Hampshire have a history being fiercely independent, and New Hampshire is one of the only states that has a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nh.gov/constitution/billofrights.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">right of the people&nbsp;to revolution</a> within its Constitution.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.nhrebellion.org/press_release" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement from NH Rebellion</a>, Governor Buddy Roemer commented:</p>

<p>"New Hampshire is where I kicked off my campaign for president because I knew the New Hampshire voter cared about the issues of corruption and campaign finance reform. For the continuation of our Republic, we must make the issue of corruption the number one issue during the next presidential election, and it starts in New Hampshire."</p>

<p>"Restoring free and fair elections in America is the number one issue because it affects all other issues. Until we reform the way we elect people to Congress, our federal government will continue to be dysfunctional and incapable of solving the vital challenges we face as a country," stated Cenk Uygur, host of&nbsp;<em>The Young Turks</em>. "It is our generation's greatest responsibility to create a separation of wealth and state by removing private money from public elections."</p>
