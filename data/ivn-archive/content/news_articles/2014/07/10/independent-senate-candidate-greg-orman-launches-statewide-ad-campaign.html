<p>Entrepreneur <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/30/interview-with-kansas-independent-u-s-senate-candidate-greg-orman/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Greg Orman</strong></a>, an independent candidate running for U.S. Senate in Kansas, on Thursday launched a statewide broadcast, cable, and radio ad campaign in every media market in the state.</p>

<p>Orman released two television ads: "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEnTDCop-XA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stuck</a>" and "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6erxUAC1Ncw" rel="noopener noreferrer">Businessman</a>."</p>

<p>"Stuck" is a 30-second commercial depicting red and blue teams in a never-ending tug-of-war match to win over America. The ad focuses on the fact that the partisan struggle for control in Washington is preventing any progress from being made.</p>
<p>"Most Kansans just want government to live within itâ€™s means and stop telling the rest of us how to live our lives," Orman says in the video.</p>
<p>In "Businessman," Orman talks about his experience as a businessman, entrepreneur, job creator, and common-sense problem solver and how that is exactly what America needs right now in Washington.</p>
<p>Both videos have a common theme that has provided the cornerstone for Orman's campaign: Washington is broken. He is currently in the process of garnering 5,000 signatures needed from registered Kansas voters to qualify for the general election ballot.</p>
