<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/30/interview-with-kansas-independent-u-s-senate-candidate-greg-orman/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Orman</a></strong>, the independent candidate for U.S. Senate in Kansas, hit a major milestone on Wednesday by reaching the $600,000 mark in individual campaign contributions. This total does not include any PAC money (his campaign is not accepting any PAC money) or personal contributions from Mr. Orman.</p>

<p>This is an important milestone because it is showing the growing vitality and viability of independent campaigns in Kansas and nationwide.</p>

<p><span>“This is a remarkable fundraising effort for an independent candidate in such a short period of time. Greg’s message of fixing the mess in Washington through common-sense problem solving is clearly resonating with voters," Orman's campaign manager said.

<p>He is also approaching the signature goal to qualify for the November ballot.</p>

<p><em>More information about the campaign can be found on the <a href="http://www.ormanforsenate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Orman for U.S. Senate</a> website, including a full biography, the issues Mr. Orman finds important, along with multimedia and press releases.</em></p>
