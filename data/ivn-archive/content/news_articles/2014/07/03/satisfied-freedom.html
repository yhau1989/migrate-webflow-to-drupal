<p>Leading up to the Fourth of July, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/172019/americans-less-satisfied-freedom.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup reports</a> that Americans are less satisfied with their freedom to choose what they do with their lives than they were 7 years ago.&nbsp;In 2006, 91 percent of Americans were satisfied with their freedom. That number dropped 12 percentage points to 79 percent in 2013.</p>

<p>How does the U.S. measure up?</p>
<p>The U.S. ranks thirty-sixth among all 120 participating countries. With the significant decline in public opinion between 2006 and 2013, America no longer ranks in the top quartile worldwide for countries with the&nbsp;highest&nbsp;levels of satisfaction with freedom.</p>
<p>[social_blockquote quote="America ranks 36th among 120 countries when it comes to satisfaction with freedom." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295645966" handle="" hashes=""]Additionally, only 10 countries had declines as large or larger than the U.S.&nbsp;As a country that prides itself in the principles of freedom, we can do better.</p>
<p>In the last 7 years, we’ve been exposed to the extent of <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/01/21/usa-todaypew-53-oppose-nsa-data-collection/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mass surveillance</a>&nbsp;on American citizens -- both corporate and governmental.&nbsp;We have seen how the electoral process has been <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/26/why-political-parties-control-elections-and-how-to-end-partisanship/" rel="noopener noreferrer">hijacked</a>&nbsp;by the two major parties, disenfranchising nonpartisan voters from participating in our democracy. We have witnessed the shrinking of the middle class, with <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/04/20-americans-live-poverty-statistics-reveal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 percent of Americans</a> now living in poverty.</p>
<p>Gallup speculates that the decline in freedom is linked to our perception of corruption in the national government:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>"</span>Americans not only feel that the U.S. government is performing poorly, as demonstrated by record-low&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/171710/public-faith-congress-falls-again-hits-historic-low.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">congressional approval ratings</a>, but they also report that the U.S. government itself as one of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166844/government-itself-cited-top-problem.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest problem facing the country today</a>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;in all three branches of government&nbsp;has reached&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/171992/americans-losing-confidence-branches-gov.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">record lows</a>, an indication that we do not trust the government to protect our freedoms.</p>
<p>Take a moment this July 4 to reflect on what you are celebrating. Fourth of July is a celebration of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and our freedom from Great Britain’s rule. It is a celebration of the founding of our country, the land of the free. It is a celebration of the <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/02/why-we-should-celebrate-independence-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">progress</a> we have made as a representative democracy.</p>
<p>This Fourth of July, are you satisfied with your freedom?</p>
