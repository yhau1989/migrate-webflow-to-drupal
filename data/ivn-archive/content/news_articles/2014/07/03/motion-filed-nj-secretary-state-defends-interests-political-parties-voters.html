<p>(Newark, NJ) — In May, New Jersey Secretary of State Kim Guadagno <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/05/12/nj-attorney-general-2-6-million-nj-voters-right-vote-primary/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a motion</a> to dismiss a <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/05/lawsuit-filed-nj-federal-court-challenges-constitutionality-partisan-primary-elections/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> filed on behalf of the 47% of New Jersey voters who choose not to join a political party. The secretary of state argued that voters have no fundamental right to participate in primary elections despite the fact that their tax dollars fund them.</p>

<p>Independents in New Jersey are required to join a political party in order to vote in the primary.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Plaintiffs filed their response:</p>

<p>The two main issues in the case include: (1) whether the fundamental right to vote includes the right to vote in a primary election, and (2) whether Plaintiffs' claim brought under the state of New Jersey’s constitutional prohibition against the use of public funds for a private purpose is barred by state sovereign immunity:</p>
<h4><strong>Plaintiffs, on the fundamental right:</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>"Plaintiffs have merely asked the State to ensure that the publicly funded primary election system not function as a private enterprise that deprives Plaintiffs of their ability to cast a meaningful vote, and in doing so, confers on those private political parties a gratuitous advantage." – Page 22</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>On state sovereign immunity:</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>"Affording Defendant the veil of state sovereignty would de facto immunize private interests from constitutional scrutiny whenever the State, or an actor of the State, is so influenced by those private interests that they become one and the same." – Page 31</em></blockquote>
<h3><strong>ABOUT THE PLAINTIFFS:</strong></h3>
