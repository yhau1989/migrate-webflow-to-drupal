<p>In 2011,&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;columnist Paul Krugman&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/opinion/krugman-the-post-truth-campaign.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">lamented</a>&nbsp;that the proliferation of half-true statements and fallacious accusations during the 2012 presidential campaign had inaugurated&nbsp;an era of "post-truth politics."</p>

<p>This era is particularly enabled by the features of our contemporary media-saturated political environment: the&nbsp;distrust of the mainstream media, the rise of alternative and slanted news&nbsp;outlets, and a 24-hour news cycle that emits data and soundbites at&nbsp;a&nbsp;velocity&nbsp;and volume&nbsp;that can overwhelm even the most omnivorous&nbsp;and scrupulous&nbsp;consumer.</p>

<p>But the very technology that enables the proliferation of misinformation should, theoretically, be able to combat it.&nbsp;Enter the fact-checking phenomenon.</p>

[heading title="Three Fact Check Sources" subtitle=""]
<p>The first major political fact-checker to arrive on the scene was<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;FactCheck.org</a>, which was launched in 2003 by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center. FactCheck.org’s dozen-member staff regularly updates its blog evaluating the claims of politicians, pundits, and advertisements by checking them against authoritative reports, studies, and other documented facts.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The truth is made by people with their own biases, limitations, and subjective standards." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295645380" handle="" hashes=""]In 2007, the Tampa Bay Times&nbsp;started its own fact-checking project:&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolitiFact</a>. Its staff harvests the statements of politicians, lobbyists, journalists, and&nbsp;pundits and assigns them a rating on the "Truth-O-Meter," ranging from "True," then through several degrees of veracity -- all the way to "False" and "Pants on Fire."</p>

<p>Finally,&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;made its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fact Checker</a>&nbsp;permanent in 2011 after a temporary existence during the 2008 presidential election. Its operator, Glenn Kessler, doles out 0 to 4 Pinocchios to statements based on the degree of a claim's&nbsp;factuality, completeness, and&nbsp;intended effect.</p>

<p>While these fact-checking outfits nobly strive to maintain a floor of objectivity in their work,&nbsp;it is important to remember that old Enlightenment figure Giambattista Vico's&nbsp;verum factum&nbsp;principle: the truth is made -- made by people with their own biases, limitations, and subjective standards.</p>

<p>So, how reliable are fact check sources?&nbsp;Let's start with an illustrative and comparative example.</p>

[heading title="Evaluating the President's Insurance Promise" subtitle=""]
<p>PolitiFact's Angie Holan awarded President Obama's claim, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it" as 2013's&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/wp-admin/If%20you%20like%20your%20health%20care%20plan,%20you%20can%20keep%20it'" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lie of the Year</a>.&nbsp;However, in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer">2008</a>,&nbsp;Angie Holan rated that same&nbsp;claim as "True." As&nbsp;Forbes'&nbsp;Avik Roy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/12/27/in-2008-politifacts-2013-lie-of-the-year-that-you-could-keep-your-health-plan-under-obamacare-it-rated-true/" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out</a>&nbsp;in his chronicling of PolitiFact's evolution on the veracity of this claim, Holan initially only cited sources that confirmed her conclusion and neglected more critical -- and clairvoyant -- voices.</p>

<p>Though one may forgive this&nbsp;error somewhat&nbsp;given that Congress did not pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) until March 2010, even thereafter, PolitiFact&nbsp;and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Washington Post's Fact Checker were slow -- if not reluctant -- to reach their later, more accurate conclusions.</p>

<p>For instance,&nbsp;The Washington Post's&nbsp;Kessler makes no mention of Obama's&nbsp;untruth in a lengthy&nbsp;examination of&nbsp;<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2011/01/health_care_myths.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">facts and myths</a>&nbsp;about the ACA in 2011, and not until October 2013&nbsp;does he assign it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/30/obamas-pledge-that-no-one-will-take-away-your-health-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 Pinocchios</a>.</p>

<p>As for PolitiFact: even in&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/wp-admin/His%20health%20care%20law%20does%20take%20pains%20to%20allow%20Americans%20to%20keep%20their%20health%20plan%20if%20they%20want%20to%20remain%20on%20it.%20But%20Obama%20suggests%20that%20keeping%20the%20insurance%20you%20like%20is%20guaranteed.%20%20In%20reality,%20Americans%20are%20not%20simply%20able%20to%20keep%20their%20insurance%20through%20thick%20and%20thin." rel="noopener noreferrer">late 2012</a>, after an exhaustive summary of analyses from various government reports and assessments from think tanks,&nbsp;Louis Jacobson -- in an article edited by Angie Holan -- arrives at&nbsp;the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>…Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed.

In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. [...]&nbsp;We rate Obama’s claim Half True.</blockquote>
<p>A year later, PolitiFact "evolved" and&nbsp;gave this exact same claim a&nbsp;"Pants on Fire" rating even though it was already long&nbsp;understood that some&nbsp;plans -- even those that had been "grandfathered" in at the time of the ACA's passage -- were going to be cancelled because they did not comply with rules and regulations that the law imposes on insurers.</p>

<p>FactCheck.org, on the other hand (writing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/03/obamas-glowing-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer">weeks</a>&nbsp;before the bill was even passed), was correct&nbsp;in determining that while most people could&nbsp;keep their plans and doctors, the president&nbsp;"can’t make that promise to everyone."</p>

[heading title="Subjectivity, Bias, and Other Flaws" subtitle=""]
<p>FactCheck.org's reliability&nbsp;is due in part to its somewhat inconvenient yet also wise refusal to assign simple ratings along a continuous spectrum: it does not summarily declare statements "True" or "False," but instead provides detailed analysis explaining their incorrectness or incompleteness and lets the reader reach&nbsp;his or her own conclusion.</p>

<p>Critics from all sides have pointed out the bias and editorial nature of some of PolitiFact's and Kessler’s purportedly objective verdicts.</p>

<p>For instance, PolitiFact chose the claim <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Republicans voted to end Medicare"</a> as 2011's Lie of the Year and had given the assertion that Republicans wanted to "end Medicare as we know it" a "Pants on Fire" rating. Liberals pointed to features of Paul Ryan's budget plan that would have drastically altered Medicare&nbsp;as evidence that there was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/12/20/paul_ryan_conquers_politifact.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">some truth</a>&nbsp;to the claim and thus it deserved a more sympathetic rating.</p>

<p>Conservatives have pointed to the abuse of the "Pants on Fire" label&nbsp;as a way to embarrass&nbsp;Republicans, a rating which began as a joke and is only to be reserved for claims that are both inaccurate and ridiculous, such as Joe Biden's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politifactbias.com/2013/02/research-update-politifact-in-2012.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>&nbsp;that President George W. Bush was "brain-dead."</p>

<p>According to one time-bound&nbsp;<a href="http://www.humanevents.com/2012/08/30/politifact-bias-does-the-gop-tell-nine-times-more-lies-than-left-really/" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a>, PolitiFact rated 119 Republican and conservative claims as "Pants on Fire" compared to 13 from Democrats and liberals.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The most appealing feature of some fact checking websites&nbsp;-- the simplified&nbsp;determination of a statement's truthfulness -- may also be their greatest weakness." author="Andrew Gripp, IVN contributor"]The Washington Post's&nbsp;Kessler likewise blends objectivity and opinion, in part due to his&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">admission</a>&nbsp;that, "We are interested only in verifiable facts, though on occasion we may examine the roots of political rhetoric."</p>

<p>For instance, in 2012, he researched&nbsp;the accusation made&nbsp;in a pro-Romney ad that Obama had not visited Israel since becoming president. Though entirely true, Kessler gave the claim <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/obama-knocked-for-not-visiting-israel/2012/08/03/9420de6e-dce3-11e1-8e43-4a3c4375504a_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Pinocchios</a>&nbsp;because he disagreed with the insinuation&nbsp;that President Obama had been uniquely unfriendly to Israel compared to his predecessors.</p>

<p>Thus, the most appealing feature of some fact checking websites -- the simplified&nbsp;determination of a statement's truthfulness -- may also be their greatest weakness. Such ratings, whether on a "Truth-O-Meter" or the "Pinocchio scale," needlessly inject&nbsp;subjectivity into what are otherwise objective analyses.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Kessler's one-man fact-checking operation is prone to missing&nbsp;contradictory information. For instance, when Herman Cain claimed that terrorists had crossed the Mexican border during a Republican debate, Kessler mistakenly called that a canard, having&nbsp;overlooked ample and reliable <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/11/05/the-ten-worst-fact-checks-of-the-2012-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence</a> that terrorists have indeed&nbsp;come to the U.S. through Mexico.</p>

<p>Relatedly, fact checkers are not immune to confirmation&nbsp;bias; that is, citing&nbsp;sources that support&nbsp;their favored&nbsp;conclusion. Holan's positive evaluation of the president's insurance promise in 2008 is one example. Also, critics can point to other examples of fact checkers relying on establishment&nbsp;or self-proclaimed expert opinion&nbsp;to&nbsp;defend the <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/rusty-weiss/2009/06/21/washington-post-can-t-locate-experts-critical-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer">conventional wisdom</a> or to falsify <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/05/politifact_and_the_scam_of_neutral_expertise/" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial statements</a>.</p>

[heading title="Conclusion" subtitle=""]
<p>In 1920, the great American writer Walter Lippmann&nbsp;asserted,&nbsp;“There can be no liberty for a community which lacks the means by which to detect lies," which brings us to the real importance of fact check sources.</p>

<p>Their strength lies in the&nbsp;creation&nbsp;of databases, many of them easily searchable,&nbsp;of statements and promises made by influential&nbsp;and powerful&nbsp;people. Such readily available resources are&nbsp;a prerequisite for journalistic and political accountability.&nbsp;By compiling so many statements and bringing outside and authoritative sources to bear on them, fact check sources -- despite their imperfections -- can aid us in preventing the threatening entrenchment&nbsp;of a "post-truth" political environment.</p>
