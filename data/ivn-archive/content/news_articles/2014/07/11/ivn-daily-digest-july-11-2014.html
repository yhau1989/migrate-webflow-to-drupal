<h3>1. Letter to <a href="http://www.aspentimes.com/news/snowmass/12149327-113/colorado-voters-associate-constitution" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Aspen Times</a> says many Colorado voters are denied their constitutionally-protected rights of non-association and equal access to elections under the state's partisan primary system.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The U.S. Constitution and the Colorado Constitution both guarantee “freedom of association” — the freedom to associate with whom we please, which necessarily includes the freedom not to associate — to decline to associate with certain people or organizations. The U.S. Constitution and the Colorado Constitution also provide for such rights as “due process” and “equal protection,” which guarantee the right of people to participate equally in the political process."</em></p>

I will focus on bringing people together not partisan bickering and division.&nbsp;I will work to unite Republicans, Democrats, and Independents who are committed to putting the interests of the country ahead of partisan self-interests,” Jenkins said.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, Nebraska Secretary of State John Gale certified Jenkins for the ballot. The state required Jenkins to turn in at least 4,000 valid signatures from registered voters in the state with at least 750 signatures from each of Nebraska's 3 congressional districts.
