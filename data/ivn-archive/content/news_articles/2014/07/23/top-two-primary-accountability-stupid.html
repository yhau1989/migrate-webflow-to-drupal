<p>In 2010, California became the second state to adopt a nonpartisan, “Top-Two” primary, where all candidates and voters participate on the same ballot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a common misconception about the purpose of the Top-Two primary that infects nearly every commentator, political scientist, and other so-called election expert: that Top-Two is intended to produce moderation.</p>

<p>Rarely do these folks ever consider that the purpose behind Top-Two might be more fundamental and less focused on a particular outcome: that representatives should be accountable to people instead of parties.</p>

<p>It is almost universally accepted and recognized that partisanship has infected our political discourse and reduced our electoral system to a game of <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/26/why-political-parties-control-elections-and-how-to-end-partisanship/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrats v. Republicans</a>. Pollsters and consultants work together to divide the electorate between superficial red and blue teams and take it as an axiom that everyone who doesn’t wear a particular jersey has one hiding in their closet.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Representatives should be accountable to people instead of parties." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295647298" handle="" hashes=""]As a consequence, the same folks that pontificate over our political permutations see the Top-Two primary through the glasses of this same partisan perspective. Therefore, their mode of measuring the merits of Top-Two matriculates toward assessing its moderating effect; where its “success” depends on bridging a gap between two “sides” of the electoral game played by Democrats and Republicans.

<p>But what if representatives are supposed to represent people, and not parties?</p>

<p>What if a candidate didn’t have to first be rubber-stamped by a private political organization before they had the privilege of running in our public elections?</p>

<p>What if a bill could just be practical, and not merely Republican, Democrat, or “somewhere in the middle”?</p>

<p>What if some voters are “left” of the Democrats on some issues, and “right” of the Republicans on others?</p>

<p>What if the right to vote derived from the right of every individual to participate equally, regardless of their ideology, race, gender, favorite pizza toppings, or willingness to join a political party?</p>

<p>And what if the Top-Two primary was about making sure representatives are accountable to their entire district, and not just their party, or the so-called “moderate middle”?</p>
