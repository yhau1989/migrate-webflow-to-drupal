<p>California’s Republican Party is counting on Orange County Supervisor <a href="http://www.janet2014.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet Nguyen</a> to help break a potential two-thirds Democratic super-majority in the state legislature this November. She’s running against Democrat <a href="http://www.solorioforsenate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose Solorio</a> (AD-69) to represent the 34th Senate District as a result of the June 3 nonpartisan, top-two open primary.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Prop 14 empowers voters to have more choices at the ballot box and encourages candidates to campaign to everyone" hyperlink="http://ow.ly/z1y3W" handle="JoseSolorio " hashes=""]The nonpartisan primary, also known as Proposition 14, was passed by a majority of voters in 2010. All voters and candidates, regardless of party affiliation, participate on a single ballot and the top two vote getters move on to the general election.

<p>Nguyen received 52 percent of the <a href="http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/state-senate/district/34/" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary</a> vote, while Solorio came in second with 33 percent. Republican Long Pham placed third with 14 percent.</p>

<p>2014 will be the first state Senate election in the recently redrawn district. It now includes parts of Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Westminster, and surrounding areas.</p>

<p>As it is the first state Senate election, it was also the first time district voters chose candidates under California’s top-two primary. That being said, Nguyen's strong showing in the primary may be counteracted by the district's slight Democratic bend -- 53 percent of SD-34 voters voted to re-elect President Obama in 2012, according to <a href="http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/districts/SD34/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Around the Capitol</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about the new system, Solorio said he sees California's nonpartisan primary as an opportunity to reach out to all voters in the district:</p>
<blockquote>"I think it’s still a little too early to tell what the lasting benefits of the measure will be, but I still believe that it appropriately empowers voters to have more choices at the ballot box and encourages candidates to campaign to everyone. I think it’s a healthy reform for our elections process in California and am always eager to hear what others think about this new primary system."</blockquote>
<p>Supervisor Nguyen sees the new system as an opportunity for Republicans to attract non-affiliated voters, stating:</p>
<blockquote>"We are still assessing the impact of Proposition 14 on voter participation, but I believe that any political party that ignores the growing ranks of independent voters is doomed."</blockquote>
<p>Spending on the election is expected to reach seven figures before the final ballot is cast. The race has also drawn the <a href="http://www.cagop.org/janet-nguyen-senate-district-34/" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention</a> of the California GOP.</p>

<p>While the strategy that leads to the California state Senate is not yet known, the contest to represent California's 34th Senate District will be hard-fought. Voter registration in the 34th district is closely split between the Republican and Democratic parties, 35.3 percent and 38.3 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>Consequently, the path to the California state Senate will be decided -- at least in part -- by the region's <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/15day-primary-2014/senate.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">80,000</a> independent voters.</p>
