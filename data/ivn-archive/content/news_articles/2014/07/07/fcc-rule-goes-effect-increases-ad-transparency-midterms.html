<p>On July 1, 2014, part of a 2012 Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;rule became active that will make it easier for voters to know who is paying for political TV advertisements.</p>

<p>In April 2012, the FCC decided in a 2-1 vote to&nbsp;require the four biggest broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox -- to make public their contracts with purchasers of ad time. Since August 2012, the FCC has run a <a href="https://stations.fcc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that allows viewers to search these purchases by&nbsp;network and to <a href="https://stations.fcc.gov/station-profile/kyw-tv/political-files/browse-%3E2014-%3Efederal-%3Eus_house-%3Epa_cd-13-%3Ebrendan_boyle" rel="noopener noreferrer">view contract information</a>, including who purchased the spot, its cost, and how often it will run.</p>

<p>Initially, the rule applied only to affiliates of the "Big Four" in the 50 largest media markets, which aired approximately 60 percent of the nation's total ads.</p>

<p>In 2012, advertisers spent $3.1 billion to run political ads&nbsp;on local TV stations.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="In 2012, advertisers spent $3.1 billion to run political ads on local TV stations." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295646056" handle="" hashes=""]As of&nbsp;July 1, 2014, however,&nbsp;every&nbsp;station -- large and small&nbsp; -- from the nation's&nbsp;210 media markets must now disclose its&nbsp;ad files, expanding the number of affiliates that must comply from roughly 230 in 2012 to over 2,000 now.

<p>These recent disclosures reveal that advertising activity for the 2014 midterm elections is already well underway across the country -- especially by Super PACs and other <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?chrt=V&amp;type=S" rel="noopener noreferrer">outside groups</a> -- in states and media markets where such ad files&nbsp;were previously more difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>In Louisiana, for instance,&nbsp;a conservative 501(c)(4) group named Generation Opportunity&nbsp;has&nbsp;already spent more than $50,000 to purchase 183 ads in the Lake Charles, Lafayette, and New Orleans markets. Generation Opportunity has raised millions of dollars -- the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/05/genopp-too-another-group-almost-wholly-funded-by-koch-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bulk of its funding</a> -- from groups related to the Koch brothers and ran <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgsxDX3UG3Y" rel="noopener noreferrer">advertisements</a> in 2013 featuring&nbsp;a large and creepy Uncle Sam that were meant to discourage young adults&nbsp;from enrolling in&nbsp;the health care exchanges.</p>

<p>Also, Senate Majority PAC has spent over $35,000 to purchase 107 spots&nbsp;in the state to help incumbent Mary Landrieu (D-LA) defend her seat.</p>

<p>The new disclosure rules show that&nbsp;outside groups have also <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/07/02/grab-your-ear-plugs-political-advertisers-have-time-reserved-all-the-way-through-nov-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">already scheduled</a> ad spots in other states with highly contested congressional&nbsp;seats.</p>

<p>The availability of these ad files makes it easier to enforce existing campaign finance regulations, which have been greatly altered in recent elections since the&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em> case in 2010.</p>

<p>The 2010 decision&nbsp;led to the formation of Super PACs, which are independent groups that&nbsp;can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money&nbsp;to influence elections so long as they do not directly coordinate with candidates. However, these groups must disclose their donors and their <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/rules.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">spending</a>, such as what they spent on issue ads or&nbsp;"electioneering communications."</p>

<p>Other organizations&nbsp;that may purchase TV ads are tax-exempt 501(c) groups, the most politically active of which are 501(c)(4)s.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Politically active organizations often maintain 2 distinct operations: one Super PAC and one 501(c) entity." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295646056" handle="" hashes=""]Organizations in this class are registered with the IRS as "social welfare" groups and may not&nbsp;make political activism their primary focus.&nbsp;These 501(c)(4) groups may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money so long as their political expenditures do not account for more than half&nbsp;of their total spending, and&nbsp;they&nbsp;are not required to disclose their donors.

<p>Many politically active organizations&nbsp;often&nbsp;maintain two distinct operations -- one Super PAC and one 501(c) entity -- in order to maximize their spending capabilities while&nbsp;withholding&nbsp;information about the sources of their fundraising.</p>

<p>One such group is Karl Rove's Crossroads organization, which is represented by <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/crossroads-tax-return-shows-big-donors-but-doesnt-name-them" rel="noopener noreferrer">two related</a> entities: Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)(4), and American Crossroads, a Super PAC.</p>

<p>The shell game works&nbsp;like this: a group may raise millions of dollars through its&nbsp;non-profit, tax-exempt organization and then transfer that money to its related Super PAC -- some of which share the same address&nbsp;or PO Box. When the Super PAC opens its books, rather than revealing the names and amounts of individual contributors, one sees the bloc contribution from the non-disclosing 501(c) entity, effectively&nbsp;withholding the names of donors from view.</p>

<p>As one lawyer from the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/08/super-pacs-funneling-money-through/" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><span>“The Supreme Court in&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em></span><span>&nbsp;unleashed a flood of special interest money in politics, but promised voters that there would be disclosure…In 2012, we have the flood of money, but we don’t have the disclosure.”</span></blockquote>
<p>The FCC rule&nbsp;mandating that broadcasters disclose&nbsp;their sources of revenue from political advertisers online is expected to increase&nbsp;accountability.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="TV viewers now have a simpler way to identify which groups are purchasing ads in their home towns and how much they are spending." author=""]The 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform required broadcasters to keep track of&nbsp;any ad considered a "political matter of national importance." If an ad met this standard, the broadcaster had to indicate&nbsp;the name of the candidate being featured, the office being contested, or the issue being discussed.

<p>However, when the Sunlight Foundation, a democracy watchdog group, took a random sample of 200 ad files, <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/12/18/political-advertisers-and-tv-stations-ignore-disclosure-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">it found</a> that many filers failed to properly disclose the name of the candidate or election. Now that&nbsp;citizens can view these files easily and report omissions, there will be a greater incentive for full compliance.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;mandate is also expected to encourage transparency.</p>

<p>Before the FCC's 2012 rule, citizens who wanted to know about a station's ad revenue had to visit the station in person and request to see their paper documents. Volunteers shared their findings through searchable online databases&nbsp;such as <a href="http://politicaladsleuth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Political Ad Sleuth.</a></p>

<p>TV viewers&nbsp;now have a simpler way to identify which groups are purchasing ads in their home towns and how much they are spending -- a major boon to citizens&nbsp;in the post-<em>Citizens United</em>&nbsp;environment.</p>
