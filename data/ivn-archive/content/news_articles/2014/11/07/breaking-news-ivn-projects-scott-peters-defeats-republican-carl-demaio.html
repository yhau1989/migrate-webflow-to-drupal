<p><em>UPDATE November 7, 2014 at 6:00pm: As IVN predicted, the latest count shows Scott Peter's lead widening dramatically to almost 4,500 votes. As of Friday evening, Peters now has 51.2% of the vote (<span>92,410 votes) to Demaio's 48.8% (87,919 votes).</span></em></p>

<p>IVN is projecting that first-term incumbent<strong>&nbsp;</strong>U.S. Representative<strong> Scott Peters</strong> will keep his seat in the race against&nbsp;Republican challenger <strong>Carl DeMaio</strong>&nbsp;in California's 52 Congressional District<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>With an additional&nbsp;30,000 ballots&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;by&nbsp;San Diego County as of 5 p.m. on November 6, Peters moved into the lead by 861 votes. That is an increase of 7,158 votes, while DeMaio&nbsp;only gained an additional 5,545 votes.</p>

<p>Thus, in&nbsp;the latest round of returns, Peters won 56.3 percent of the vote and DeMaio&nbsp;trailed with 43.6 percent.</p>

<p>The majority of these new&nbsp;ballots are vote-by-mail ballots being returned&nbsp;to the precincts on Election Day. Historically, the results of these ballots mirror the results of the ballots cast&nbsp;on Election Day.&nbsp;Peters won the day-of vote by a sufficient margin,&nbsp;so if he took the same percentage of mail ballots, he would win by more than a couple thousand votes. These results&nbsp;are consistent&nbsp;with that pattern. It is unlikely that any additional&nbsp;ballots will depart from that pattern sufficiently enough to change the projection&nbsp;of the vote count.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible that the county&nbsp;counted ballots from a geography that inordinately favors&nbsp;Peters, but that is unlikely. And there is a small possibility that a large percentage of the remaining ballots are from the Republican-heavy Coronado. But even so, the dramatic 13-point margin for Peters in the late returns that have been counted to date indicates that the trend will not reverse substantially enough in DeMaio's favor.</p>

<p>The race for Congressional District 52 made national headlines for being one of the most negative and most expensive races this election cycle. DeMaio&nbsp;would have also been the first openly gay Republican elected to the House.</p>
