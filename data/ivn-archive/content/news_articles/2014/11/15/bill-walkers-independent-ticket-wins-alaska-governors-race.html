<p>Alaska's 2014 gubernatorial race was neck and neck as polls closed on Tuesday, November 4. I<span>ncumbent Republican&nbsp;Governor <strong>Sean Parnell</strong> <a href="http://elect.alaska.net/data/results.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailed</a>&nbsp;independent <strong>Bill Walker</strong> 46.42 percent to 47.83 percent, with 100 percent of precincts reporting.</span></p>

<p>At the end of election night, nearly 38,000 early, absentee, and late ballots still had to be counted. After nearly two weeks of no one calling the&nbsp;race one way or another, on Saturday, November 15, CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/15/politics/walker-ousts-parnell-in-close-alaska-governors-race/index.html?hpt=hp_t2" rel="noopener noreferrer">projected Walker the winner</a> with 48 percent of the vote.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Bill Walker garnered enough support from 270K independent Alaskans to edge the incumbent." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295653556" handle="" hashes=""]Walker, a former Republican who ran as an independent, <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/10/23/who-is-alaska-independent-candidate-bill-walker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">teamed up</a> with Democrat <strong>Byron Mallott&nbsp;</strong>to create the 'Alaska First Unity' ticket in September -- Walker for governor and Mallot for lieutenant&nbsp;governor. The move turned&nbsp;Parnell's re-election campaign from 'a sure thing' to one of the closest gubernatorial races in the country.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/statistics/vi_vrs_stats_party_2014.11.03.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">majority</a> of Alaskans are not affiliated with any political party. Over 270,000 Alaskans are registered&nbsp;as either 'undeclared' or 'nonpartisan.'&nbsp;Walker&nbsp;managed to win just enough of this key demographic to defeat the incumbent.</p>

<p>Tangential to the governor's race may have been&nbsp;Ballot Measure 2, a proposal that would legalize marijuana in the state.&nbsp;The measure passed on Election Day with 52 percent in favor to 48 percent opposed.</p>

<p>With margins as slim as they were for the Alaska First&nbsp;Unity ticket, support for marijuana legalization among independents may have brought out enough voters to give Walker and Mallott&nbsp;a much needed bump in a year of anemic Democratic turnout -- even&nbsp;though the Walker/Mallott ticket actually <a href="http://www.thedutchharborfisherman.com/article/1411alaska_candidates_discuss_pebble_pot_and" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed legalization</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Independents' growing support for legalization has mostly driven the jump in Americans' overall support. Sixty-two percent of independents now favor legalization, up 12 points from November 2012."</blockquote>
<p>In an election marked by uncanny coalitions and low turnout, it may well have been Alaska's independent voters who delivered the governorship for Walker.</p>
