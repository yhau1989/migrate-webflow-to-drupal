<p>In Colorado, Governor John Hickenlooper (D) <a href="http://www.politico.com/2014-election/results/map/governor/colorado/#.VFr0QYfUUeM" rel="noopener noreferrer">held</a> on to his seat for another 4-year term. With 55 of 64 counties <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/53335/148103/Web01/en/summary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> so far, he defeated Republican challenger Bob Beauprez 48.87 percent to 46.49 percent. The race was neck and&nbsp;neck heading into Election Day as the election heated up over social issues like gun control and the death penalty.</p>

<p>As the numbers came in, counting went on into the early morning hours after the polls closed. The <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2014/ci_26870461/hickenlooper-declares-victory-beauprez-refuses-concede-colorado" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denver Post</a> called the election in favor of Hickenlooper at 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 5.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The third-party candidates made a big statement in their ability to decide the outcome of the race." author=""]Hickenlooper gave an acceptance speech Wednesday morning, coming into the room <p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2014/ci_26870461/hickenlooper-declares-victory-beauprez-refuses-concede-colorado" rel="noopener noreferrer">chanting</a>, "Four more years! Four more years!" Hickenlooper opened his statement with, "Voters of Colorado have spoken."</p>

<p>Yet Beauprez <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2014/ci_26870461/hickenlooper-declares-victory-beauprez-refuses-concede-colorado" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused</a> to concede the race.</p>

<p>However, at 3:45 p.m. on Wednesday, Beauprez finally did&nbsp;<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2014/ci_26870461/hickenlooper-declares-victory-beauprez-refuses-concede-colorado" rel="noopener noreferrer">concede</a>. In a letter to supporters, Beauprez said, <span><span>"there just aren't enough options to get us across the finish line," according to the Denver Post<em>.</em>
</span></span></p>

<p>With such a close race, a margin of about 2 percentage points, the <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/53335/148103/Web01/en/summary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party</a> candidates definitely threw their weight into the election for Colorado's next governor. Independent candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/10/14/independent-mike-dunafon-high-hopes-colorado-gov-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Dunafon</a> won <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/53335/148103/Web01/en/summary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.15 percent</a> of the total vote (22,455 votes).&nbsp; Libertarian candidate Matthew Hess pulled out <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/53335/148103/Web01/en/summary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.90 percent</a> of the vote (36,970 votes).</p>

<p>In a night with many Republican victories, Hickenlooper maintained his seat and reinforced the <a href="http://www.politico.com/2014-election/results/map/governor/colorado/#.VFr0QYfUUeM" rel="noopener noreferrer">trend </a>toward a blue-leaning urban population and red rural population. As Colorado continues to diversify, it is likely to be&nbsp;a battleground state for many elections to come.</p>

<p>The third-party candidates made a big statement in their ability to decide the outcome of the race. Had voters jumped ship from the Libertarian candidate or independent Dunafon, Beauprez likely would have seen an increase in votes. However, Hess and Dunafon clearly appealed to a bloc of voters who&nbsp;are dissatisfied with the two major-party candidates.</p>
