<p>Vice President <strong>Joe Biden</strong>'s comments on Election Day that independent <strong>Greg Orman</strong> was "with us" could have had a profound impact on the election. Before his comments, Democrats had remained mostly silent on speculating which party Orman would caucus with while&nbsp;Republican attack ads claimed Orman was a closet Democrat and would caucus with Democrats in the Senate.</p>

<p>In one, last-minute sentence,&nbsp;Biden threw a political bone that was devoured by the media, Internet news outlets, and the Roberts campaign. But just how planned was it?</p>
<h3>The Historical Role of the Vice&nbsp;Presidency</h3>
<p>In modern politics, vice presidents often fill the role of the attack dog -- keeping the president above the messy squabbling. This role is most prevalent&nbsp;in the media and presidential debates.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="In modern politics, vice presidents often fill the role of the attack dog." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295653448" handle="" hashes=""]The president usually sticks to a positive message relating to his platform and agenda while the vice president fends off attacks and even goes on the attack to protect the administration's agenda.

<p>Joe Biden has filled this role well.</p>

<p>Biden portrays himself as a folksy, salt-of-the-earth type of guy. He swears occasionally in public, and while usually this is a no-no for politicians, it just "works" for him and adds to his credibility as a simple politician with a direct message.</p>

<p>But this politician is far from simple and has a whole arsenal of top advisers who help him with strategy&nbsp;and planning his next moves. Democratic political science geniuses like Jared Bernstein, Jake Sullivan, and Jeff Prescott help keep Joe Biden focused while navigating the land mines of politics.</p>
<h3>Joe Biden Promotes Joe Biden's Agenda</h3>
<p>Political opponents may call Biden the president's "attack dog," but the vice president&nbsp;has also been known to promote his own agenda, even at the expense of his own party or the president's agenda. While the media often dismisses these remarks as "goofs,"&nbsp;they are likely more calculated than people are led to believe.</p>

<p>In 2012, Biden completely caught the White House off guard by forcing <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76103.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> to take a stand on gay marriage during his campaign&nbsp;against Mitt Romney. Obama had previously&nbsp;remained silent on gay marriage, yet was forced to make it a major civil rights issue in a presidential election year.</p>

<p>Obama's heavy reliance on Biden's foreign policy experience was also highlighted in 2012 when Obama's campaign considered <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/28/biden-agenda" rel="noopener noreferrer">replacing Biden</a> in order to bolster the president's credibility. Internal polling showed that it wouldn't help their campaign, but it reveals a rift in the White House that Biden had outlived his usefulness.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The next two years will be defined by Biden's attempts to consolidate support as a credible candidate for the presidency." author=""]Joe Biden's eyes are currently on 2016. Very rarely does a sitting two-term vice president choose not to run for the White House. The next two years will be defined by Biden's attempts to consolidate support as a credible candidate for the presidency.

<p>A Republican Congress is probably one of Biden's best tools. Democratic control of the Senate would have shifted too much blame and attention on his own party, but a Republican Congress will serve only as a target for Democratic strategists and advertisers.</p>

<p>Biden bucked every single major poll the last week of the election, emphatically declaring&nbsp;the Democrats would retain the Senate. I don't think this was a moment of delusion from Biden, but a deliberate&nbsp;strategy. After all, reports indicate the White House was already preparing for a Congress fully controlled by Republicans before Election Day.</p>

<p>As the president of a&nbsp;Senate controlled by Republicans, he stands as a symbol of the last defense against the conservative agenda. Leading a Democratically-controlled Senate only makes him a part of the problem -- a symbol of gridlock and the do-nothing agenda of Harry Reid.</p>

<p>Democrats almost completely ignored Greg Orman's campaign until Biden's last-minute comments. I think Joe Biden intentionally threw Orman under the proverbial bus to increase his own chances at the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. Joe Biden is either a crafty, back-biting politician or a bumbling fool -- and I'm not buying the bumbling fool role.</p>
