<p>Kentucky U.S. Senator <strong>Rand Paul</strong> appeared on <em>Face the Nation</em> with&nbsp;<span>Bob Schieffer on&nbsp;</span>Sunday. Paul, who has been campaigning across the nation for conservative candidates ahead of Election Day, backed up some sharp criticism for the direction of his own political party.</p>

<p>Schieffer asked, "You said and this is your quote, the Republican brand sucks. That's a pretty unusual rallying cry in an election year."</p>

<p>Paul's response emphasized the need for Republicans to reach out to the African-American community in more ways than one.</p>
<blockquote>"We have a wall, or a barrier, between us and African-American voters. So I spent the last year trying to break down some of that wall and say look, maybe what the Democrats have been doing for you -- or maybe you're being taken for granted -- maybe it's not working..."</blockquote>
<p>To Schiffer's question, "What can you offer African-American voters?" Paul highlighted his bipartisan effort to reinfranchise individuals with past nonviolent felony convictions and steer the rest of his party away from restrictive voter ID policies.</p>

<p>He added, "By being for all these things it reinforces a stereotype that we need to break down."</p>

<p>On the topic of what Republicans and Democrats could work together on, Paul laid out a few reforms for the 114th Congress:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Criminal Justice reform</li>
	<li>Reduced sentences for nonviolent drug offenses</li>
	<li>Reinfranchising individuals with nonviolent felony convictions</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out the 10 minute interview, Paul contrasted his diplomatic style against Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's:</p>
<blockquote>"We live in a world where we have so much cacophony of voices on TV sometimes yelling back and forth. And I think there's a resurgence of people who want a little more civility in discourse."</blockquote>
