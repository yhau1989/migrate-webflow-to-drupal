<p>The latest public opinion polls out of Georgia show that Governor Nathan Deal has opened up a bit of lead on his opponent, Democrat Jason Carter -- by as much as 6 points, according to a <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/new-polls-show-gop-lead-senate-gubernatorial-races/nhyXY/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WSB-TV/Landmark poll</a>. The same poll shows Republican David Perdue leading by 4 points over Democrat Michelle Nunn in the U.S. Senate race.</p>

<p>While this poll seems to indicate that Republicans have an advantage going into Election Day, early voting numbers may tell a different story. These races are still going to be very close.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Early voting in Georgia is up 20% from&nbsp;2010." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295653268" handle="TheShawnG" hashes=""]Several reports indicate that voter turnout nationwide may be down from a typical midterm election year because of a lack of competitive races and general dissatisfaction&nbsp;with the government and the political process. However, in Georgia, voter turnout may actually be higher than expected because of these major statewide races.

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/early-voting-in-georgia-up-more-than-20-percent-ov/nhydJ/#__federated=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlantic Journal-Constitution</a>, early voting in Georgia is up 20 percent from what it was in 2010 -- the last midterm election. There were a total of 939,136 ballots cast during the early voting period, which ended on Friday. Approximately 90 percent of the ballots were cast in person.</p>

<p>What this means for which candidates actually have the advantage going into Election Day is not entirely clear. However, on Monday, the Atlanta Daily World <a href="http://atlantadailyworld.com/2014/11/03/black-voters-turn-out-in-greater-numbers-early-in-georgia-election-than-2010/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that 31.2 percent of early votes cast were from African-American voters, a voting demographic that tends to support Democratic candidate. This is a higher percentage of the total early vote than in 2012, when blacks&nbsp;cast 29.2 percent of all early ballots.</p>

<p>A total of 36.9 percent of votes cast were from non-white voters and nearly 55 percent of early voters were female.</p>

<p>With this boost in voter enthusiasm, there is no clear prediction that can be made with statewide races in Georgia, but they are going to be extremely competitive.&nbsp;Republicans may not be as safe as people think in Georgia, which would prove the latest public opinion polls wrong.</p>
