<p>On November 4,<sup>, </sup>2014, during the general election, millions of California voters exercised their right to vote and have chosen the direction they want for the state. Like much of the United States, Californiaâ€™s political landscape is changing as independent voter registration continues to increase and candidates must now become more appealing to broader voter&nbsp;demographics.</p>

<p>California is one of two states using a nonpartisan, top-two open primary system, which puts all candidates, regardless of political affiliation, on a single ballot for all voters to consider.</p>

<p>Five races were labeled as <a href="http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/close-contests/" rel="noopener noreferrer">close-contests</a>&nbsp;by the secretary of state's office during the election.&nbsp;The race for&nbsp;governor, on the other hand, was one-sided throughout the night, ending with a midnight concession speech given by Neel Kashkari.</p>

<p>Six propositions appeared on the ballot as well, three of which were <a href="ivn.us/2014/11/05/california-proposition-results-water-bond-rainy-day-fund-and-reduced-sentences-pass/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved</a> by voters.</p>
