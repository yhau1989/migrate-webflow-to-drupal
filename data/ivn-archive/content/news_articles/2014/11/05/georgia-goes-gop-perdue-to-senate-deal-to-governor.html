<p>Georgian voters have&nbsp;re-elected Republican Nathan Deal to be their governor. He won 53 percent of the vote (with 98% of precincts&nbsp;reporting in), defeating Democrat Jason Carter, who only received 44 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Voters also elected Republican David Perdue to the U.S. Senate, who won 54 percent of the vote (with 96% of precincts reporting), defeating Democrat Michelle Nunn. Perdue will replace retiring Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss and will be entering a GOP-majority</p>

<p>Georgia will also be sending 14 representatives, 10&nbsp;Republicans and 4&nbsp;Democrats, to the House. Of the fourteen incumbents, <a href="http://www.politico.com/2014-election/results/georgia/#.VFmwoPTF_89" rel="noopener noreferrer">only seven ran opposed</a>. Of those seven races, only one was competitive --&nbsp;Republican Rick Allen defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep.&nbsp;John Barrow with 54 percent of the vote.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Of Georgia's 14 congressional seats, 7 were actually contested, and 1 was competitive." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295653328" handle="" hashes=""]In the Senate race, neither Nunn nor Perdue polled above 50 percent in the lead up to Election Day. Libertarian candidate Amanda Swafford, who regularly polled at around 3 to 4 points, ultimately won only 2 percent of the vote.

<p>Talk of a possible runoff election in January dominated headlines up to Election Day, but a runoff is no longer necessary since Perdue secured over 50 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Additionally, Georgia experienced higher than normal early&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2014/11/04/early-voting-georgia-may-prove-public-opinion-polls-wrong/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_home&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter turnout</a>, distinguishing it from most other states where the average voter is either apathetic or apoplectic with Congress and both parties.</p>

<p>That is not to say Georgians are not frustrated, either; the state suffers an 8 percent unemployment rate. Frustration and national attention on the Senate race drew more Georgians to the polls than usual.</p>

<p>Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said during&nbsp;an interview at Nunn's headquarters before the election results were released that exit polls were showing that 32 percent of the electorate was African-American. This was supposed to be to Nunn's advantage, but to no avail.</p>
<p>For a moment, Georgia, traditionally a conservative Republican bastion, looked like a battleground, but GOP candidates ended up doing better than public opinion polls suggested. Now, any hopes the Democratic Party has to flip the state will have to wait until 2016.</p>
