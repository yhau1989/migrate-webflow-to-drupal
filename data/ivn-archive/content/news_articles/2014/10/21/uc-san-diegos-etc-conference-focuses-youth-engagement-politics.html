<p>Leaders from the public, private, nonprofit, and university sectors gathered at the Great Hall at UC-San Diego on&nbsp;Thursday, October 16, for a conference on the state of politics in America today. The ETC Conference - <a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/conference_on_ethics_transparency_and_civility_at_uc_san_diego_to_be_held_o" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethics, Transparency, and Civility Conference</a> - focused on ways to increase&nbsp;youth engagement in political discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“UC-San Diego is gathering together extraordinary&nbsp;minds—including community leaders, elected officials, faculty and students—to spark an important dialogue about engaging our society members, especially students, in political discourse and decisions,” said Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div>With just&nbsp;<span>25 percent of college students&nbsp;paying&nbsp;“very” or “fairly close” attention to news about the 2014 elections, the ETC Conference aimed&nbsp;to examine&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;in a series of three panel discussions on ethics, transparency, and civility. &nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Panelists included U.S. Representative&nbsp;Susan Davis (D-Calif), Assemblymember and Republican Minority Leader Kristen Olson, dean and professor of law&nbsp;Stephen C.

[social_blockquote quote="Only 25% of college students &nbsp;pay attention to news about the 2014 election." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295652413" handle="" hashes=""]The second panel of the ETC Conference was on the&nbsp;issue of transparency --&nbsp;an issue that has risen in popularity since the revelations of the NSA surveillance programs and scandals within the California capitol.

<p>To shape the discussion, Professor Forman presented the panel with three aspects of transparency: accountability, or otherwise holding those who shape the political dialogue responsible for their actions, accessibility, meaning how voters engage with the government and their elected official, and agency, the process whereby information translates into action.</p>

<p>Panelists included Don Wilcox –&nbsp;former legislative chief-of-staff, Sam Schuchat – executive officer for the&nbsp;<a href="http://scc.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Coastal Conservancy</a>, Assemblymember Brian Jones –&nbsp;District 71, Darrel Steinberg –&nbsp;former president pro tem of the California State&nbsp;Senate, representing Senate District 6, Assemblymember Brian&nbsp;<span>Maienschein</span>&nbsp;– District 77, and Kyle Heiskala — UCSD student and former executive director for&nbsp;<a href="http://sovac.ucsd.edu/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOVAC</a>.</p>

<p>The last panel focused on themes of integrity and responsibility, calling on panelists to address the state of civility&nbsp;on our nation's civic affairs today and the costs incivility has on society.</p>
<p>Panelists included Robby Boparai, UCSD Associated Student President, San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria, Chad Peace, legal counsel for the Independent Voter Project, National Conflict Resolution Center Director Steven Dinkin, Senator State Marty Block, Assemblymember Marie Waldron, and Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez.</p>
<p>Panelists sparred on some issues discussed, but agreed that media sensationalism is partially to blame for the perception of incivility in politics.</p>
