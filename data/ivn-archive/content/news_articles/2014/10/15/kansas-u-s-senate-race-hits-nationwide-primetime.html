<p>Kansas used to be a solid red state. National politicians rarely make campaign&nbsp;stops and there&nbsp;is generally&nbsp;no national news coverage of Kansas races.</p>

<p>Not anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Greg Orman</strong>, the independent candidate for U.S. Senate will face off in a debate with incumbent Senator <strong>Pat Roberts</strong> (R) tonight at 7 p.m. CDT / 5 p.m. PDT on C-SPAN.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Greg Orman's anti-incumbent message seems to be holding up in the #KSSen race." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295652057" handle="" hashes=""]This is the final&nbsp;debate between the two candidates in an election with many wild and unexpected turns&nbsp;-- from an unexpectedly viable independent candidate in&nbsp;what was once the&nbsp;reddest state in the U.S. to lawsuits surrounding the Democratic candidate's withdrawal.

<p>Orman has been running on an anti-incumbent platform -- that Washington is broken and filled with partisan, career lawmakers. Roberts has employed a strategy of associating Orman with Harry Reid and President Obama, declaring him to be a liberal Democrat hiding behind an "independent" campaign.</p>

<p>Orman's message seems to be holding up&nbsp;with voters. He maintains a<a href="http://www.politico.com/p/polls/person/latest/greg-orman#.VD6HtfldVAs" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 3-point lead</a>&nbsp;in the most recent polls.</p>

<p>Orman recently capitalized on information that Roberts has missed over two-thirds of the agriculture committee meetings during his lengthy time on the Agricultural Committee -- a mistake that is clearly damaging for a state that&nbsp;depends on agriculture as the base of its economy. Even worse, Roberts missed the recent Ebola hearings on risks to the United States.</p>

<p>All of this supports Orman's platform that career politicians do not have the best interest for the state at heart.</p>
