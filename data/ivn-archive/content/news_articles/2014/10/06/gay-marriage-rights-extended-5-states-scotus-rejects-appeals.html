<p>The Associated Press reports that the Supreme Court on Monday&nbsp;rejected to hear the appeals of 5 states&nbsp;in an effort to keep their bans on same-sex marriage. Marriage rights will immediately be extended to gay and lesbian couples in <strong>Indiana</strong>, <strong>Oklahoma</strong>, <strong>Utah</strong>, <strong>Virginia</strong>, and <strong>Wisconsin</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to ending the delay on marriages in these states, according to the AP report, same-sex couples in 6 other states may be allowed to get married soon as well after federal courts struck down marriage bans in several states earlier this year. This would make same-sex marriage legal in 30 states, plus Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>However, the issue of same-sex marriage remains unresolved. While the justices of the high court&nbsp;refused to hear these appeals, they have not ruled on what federal legal protections same-sex couples have under the U.S. constitution to&nbsp;marriage, leaving the matter unresolved in the United States.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court did not comment on why it rejected the appeals.</p>
