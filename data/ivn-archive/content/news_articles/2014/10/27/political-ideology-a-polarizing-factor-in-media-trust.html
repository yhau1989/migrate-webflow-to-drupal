<p>"Political Polarization &amp; Media Habits" is the the latest report in an ongoing <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research</a> project tracking partisan trends among Americans. The report found:</p>
<blockquote>"When it comes to getting news about politics and government, liberals and conservatives inhabit different worlds. There is little overlap in the news sources they turn to and trust."</blockquote>
<p>The project, funded by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hewlett.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hewlett Foundation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macfound.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacArthur Foundation</a>, consisted&nbsp;of responses&nbsp;from 10,013 adults divided into 5 categories -- consistently liberal or conservative, mostly liberal or conservative, and mixed (acting as the middle ground) -- in order to understand how political ideology influences the medium an individual chooses when getting their news and how they interact on social media sites.</p>
<h2><strong>Political Affiliation A Factor in Media Trust</strong></h2>
<p>Trust in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/table/trust/" rel="noopener noreferrer">media sources</a> by those surveyed, called panelists, indicates that&nbsp;the largest schism is&nbsp;fueled by ideological differences. Fox News and NPR were the most polarized sources in terms of trust between consistent conservatives and liberals.</p>

<p>Consistent conservatives overwhelmingly trust Fox News (88%) while only 6 percent of consistent liberals reported trusting the network. NPR is&nbsp;the most trusted news source for consistent liberals, according to the survey, at 72 percent. About 3 percent of consistent conservatives said they trust NPR.</p>

<p>Panelists with 'mixed' political views are&nbsp;broadly skeptical of both news sources and reported trusting CNN the most (61%). While conservatives are more likely to agree on a main source for news, respondents with mixed political views and liberal views are more divided on what sources they prefer.</p>

<h2>Partisanship on Social Media</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.journalism.org/2013/10/24/the-role-of-news-on-facebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and other social media sites were not only identified as sources of political news but information provided by panelists gave additional insight as to&nbsp;how and with whom they share political ideas. Partisan groupthink --&nbsp;a psychological phenomenon associated with insulated cohesive group decisions --&nbsp;carries over in terms of whom panelists associate with on social media.</p>

<p>Of those surveyed, 48 percent treat Facebook as a source of political news compared to other social media sites like Twitter, YouTube, Google+, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>According to Pew, conservatives are more likely to follow posts on political parties, candidates, and officials than liberals who&nbsp;focus more on issue-based groups. On average, more than 32 percent of&nbsp;consistent conservatives and&nbsp;liberals view posts consistent&nbsp;with their&nbsp;political outlook&nbsp;and&nbsp;pay more&nbsp;attention to political posts than&nbsp;other ideological groups.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="10% of Pew panelists said&nbsp;they've dropped a friend on social media over political differences." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295652585" handle="" hashes=""]Discussions&nbsp;by both polar&nbsp;groups tend to be within their own political affiliation or party. Half of consistent conservatives talk primarily with like-minded conservatives --&nbsp;43 percent of the panelists within this group discuss politics with only Republicans.

<p>Many consistent liberals also primarily engage with other liberals (31%) and with Democrats (39%). Panelists with mixed political views said they were more likely to talk politics with conservatives and Republicans than liberals and Democrats.</p>

<p>Negative aspects&nbsp;attributed to the polarization of the country&nbsp;can be showcased by social trends. Of all panelists, 25 percent&nbsp;have responded negatively to social media content and 10 percent have dropped a friend on social media because of political differences. Thirty-two percent of consistent conservatives and 44 percent of consistent liberals have blocked, unfriended, or stopped following someone because of content.</p>

<p>An old adage on consumption reads, "you are what you eat," but in an era of increased partisanship and hyper-socialization, individual consumption can be best described as, "you are what you watch."</p>
