<p>On November 4, Georgians will decide a number of statewide and local offices -- not the least of which include the state's next senator and governor.</p>

<p>Both top-ballot races are hotly contested and polls show tight margins heading into Election Day. Incumbent Republican Governor Nathan Deal and his challenger, Democrat Jason Carter, are <a href="ivn.us/2014/10/07/independents-decide-carter-vs-deal-georgia-gubernatorial-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">neck and neck</a>. The Libertarian candidate for governor, <a href="ivn.us/2014/10/13/libertarian-candidate-andrew-hunt-shape-ga-gubernatorial-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Hunt</a>, consistently holds 6 percent in the polls. If he reaches 20 percent on Election Day, the Libertarian Party would be a recognized party in Georgia and privy to all the perks the Republican and Democratic parties currently enjoy.</p>

<p>The race for retired U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss' seat is close as well. Republican David Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn are in a dead heat as both campaigns have gone negative.</p>

<p>Not to be out-shined, Georgia's other statewide races have been building steam. The self-proclaimed '<a href="ivn.us/2014/10/25/georgia-five-momentum-seeps-into-georgia-gov-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia Five</a>' may make history as the first slate of African-American women to reach their respective statewide offices.</p>

<p>If you live in Georgia, use the above tool to find your <strong>polling location</strong>. All Georgians must have valid identification in order to vote. Accepted forms of ID, according to the Georgia Secretary of state,&nbsp;<a href="http://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/georgia_voter_identification_requirements2" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span><span>Any valid state or federal government-issued photo ID, including a FREE Voter ID Card issued by your county registrar's office or the Georgia Department of Driver Services (DDS)
</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>A Georgia Driver's License, even if expired</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Valid employee photo ID from any branch, department, agency, or entity of the U.S. Government, Georgia, or any county, municipality, board, authority or other entity of this state</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Valid U.S. passport ID</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Valid U.S. military photo ID</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Valid tribal photo ID</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have a valid ID you can receive one at the county registrar's office or Department of Driver Services' office for free.</p>
