<p>Assembly District 7 saw a 24.2 percent<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly_election,_2012" rel="noopener noreferrer"> turnout</a> in June’s top-two primary, a drop from the 28.6 percent turnout it had in the 2010 primary. A plurality of the voting population in the&nbsp;district, in which the state capital is located, are Democrats (43.4%), which is part of the reason why voters&nbsp;will choose between two Democratic city&nbsp;council members, Kevin McCarty and Steve Cohn, in November.</p>

<p>Cohn, who is leaving the Sacramento City Council after serving for 20&nbsp;years, is making a case to voters that&nbsp;there is more to him than just a party label.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="There are many issues that cross party lines, and it is important to let voters know where I stand on those issues." author="Steve Cohn"]“Unlike my opponent, Mr. McCarty, I don’t advertise being a Democrat on my lawn signs because I’m trying to appeal to independents and Republicans, as well as Democrats,” he said.

<p>His opponent, who is also on the Sacramento City Council and was once the Assembly budget consultant for&nbsp;Assemblymember Denise Moreno Ducheny, believes the race is about more than just&nbsp;reaching the 56.6&nbsp;percent of voters who are not registered with the&nbsp;Democrat Party.</p>

<p>“There are many issues that cross party lines, and it is important to let voters know where I stand on those issues,” McCarty said.</p>

<p>Both candidates share similar political resumes and agree on many issues. However, a major local issue that has distinguished these two candidates is where they stand on Sacramento’s <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/city-arena/article2602965.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">new arena</a> for the Sacramento Kings.</p>

<p>When asked about the issue,&nbsp;Cohn said, “I think my support for the new downtown arena is very beneficial to the campaign, and beneficial to the Sacramento region."</p>

<p>"This is a project that is about more than sports and&nbsp;is bringing 11,000 temporary construction jobs and 4,100 new permanent jobs to our region, and is revitalizing Downtown Sacramento,” he added.</p>

<p>Weighing the cost rather than the jobs, McCarty said:</p>
<blockquote>“The arena is a great example of an issue that resonates with constituents from different political parties, like independents. These voters are concerned with the fiscal impacts of the arena and believe as I do, that a $700 million subsidy is a risk that our city should not be taking.” -&nbsp;Kevin McCarty</blockquote>
<p>In a final appeal to voters outside the Democratic Party, Cohn said, “I am a moderate who has spent his career bringing people together, from different backgrounds, places, and ideologies, to tackle the toughest issues that we are facing. In contrast, my opponent is a very liberal and partisan Democrat, which is why he got the Democratic Party endorsement.”</p>

<p>McCarty simply replied, “Please don’t forget to vote on November 4!”</p>

<p>This&nbsp;Sacramento district will choose between Cohn’s emphasis on city projects and investments or McCarty’s approach to&nbsp;resources and public/private partnerships. The question is whether or not they will be able to get the 43.4 percent of registered Democrats and the 56.6 percent of voters&nbsp;who are not registered with the party to turn out and vote in this same-party race.</p>
