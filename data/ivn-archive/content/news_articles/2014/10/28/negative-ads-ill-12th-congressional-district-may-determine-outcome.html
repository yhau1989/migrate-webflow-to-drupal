<p>Illinois' 12th Congressional District has been one of the more closely <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/02/03/large-percentage-undecided-voters-il-12-leaves-election-toss/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">watched</a> races in the 2014 midterm elections. While each race is different, the contest between Democratic U.S. Rep.&nbsp;<strong>Bill Enyart</strong> and Republican challenger <strong>Mike Bost</strong> may be decided by the&nbsp;claims made in&nbsp;each candidate's&nbsp;ads&nbsp;about his opponent.&nbsp;However, the&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of each respective candidate may leave voters with a picture that is less than whole.</p>

<p>"Meltdown Mike," as Bost has become known, exploded in anger over last-minute changes to the state's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhbRcDZiJJc" rel="noopener noreferrer">pension</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4YNzSIk6d4" rel="noopener noreferrer">concealed carry</a> bills, two of the more contentious issues in the state in recent years. Democrats have seized on the flare-ups, which became YouTube sensations, but they have not depressed Bost's supporters.</p>

<p>According to a Politico <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=0DD78709-AC1D-404C-BBC0-A3B6CA9855E9" rel="noopener noreferrer">profile</a> of Bost, the candidate's reputation for losing his temper is not necessarily hurting him, with at least one potential voter saying it was "about time someone got mad." In what appears to be a tight race, these ads, however accurate, will likely have&nbsp;a major impact on the outcome.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The frequency at which someone votes with their party does&nbsp;not necessarily&nbsp;say much about the candidate." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295652727" handle="CarlWicklander" hashes=""]In one of Enyart's ads, he <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KjiGAJoBw" rel="noopener noreferrer">stresses</a>, "You don't lead by being loud," an unveiled reference to Bost's viral outbursts. In the same ad, Enyart, a former adjutant general of the Illinois National Guard, <a href="http://enyart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/enyart-sponsors-legislation-to-end-va-disability-backlog" rel="noopener noreferrer">touts</a> his sponsorship of a bill to reduce backlog at the Veterans Administration (VA).</p>

<p>The Veterans Backlog Reduction Act has 34 <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1739" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosponsors</a> to date and was referred to committee in April 2013. Later in the year, Enyart <a href="http://enyart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-enyart-va-claims-backlog-finally-shrinking" rel="noopener noreferrer">praised</a> the progress the VA made in reducing backlog. However, Bost <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/07/illinois-congressman-chooses-cheeseburgers-over-va-reform.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">capitalized</a> on the issue over the summer when VA scandals emerged and Enyart had seemingly taken a low profile.</p>

<p>An ad on Bost's behalf from the National Republican Congressional Committee, with the Democrat's image juxtaposed with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBVNyhd_z0" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that Enyart votes with his party nearly 90 percent of the time.</p>

<p>According to OpenCongress.org, the figure, 88 percent, is <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/412535_William_Enyart" rel="noopener noreferrer">correct</a>, although voting with one's party does <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/24/independent-republican-walter-jones-faces-tough-primary-challenge-n-c/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">not necessarily</a> say very <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/04/john-mccain/obama-and-bush-found-common-ground/" rel="noopener noreferrer">much</a>. For contrast, John J. Duncan, Jr., a Republican from Tennessee, who was known for frequently aligning with Ron Paul, <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/400116_Jimmy_Duncan" rel="noopener noreferrer">votes</a> with his party approximately 86 percent of the time.</p>

<p>Also,&nbsp;the Americans for Democratic Action gave Enyart a score of <a href="http://www.adaction.org/media/2013%20ADA%20Voting%20Record.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">55 percent</a> in its annual ratings. The score is higher than those of Republicans, but hardly remarkable for a Democrat and well behind Pelosi's score of 85 percent.</p>

<p>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ads on Enyart's behalf argue that Bost's election would make him "part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhKO0ALOQ5I" rel="noopener noreferrer">problem</a>" and "would make Washington <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAahCIL3EcI" rel="noopener noreferrer">worse</a>," based on Bost's 20&nbsp;years in the state legislature. However, Bost, a Republican, has been in the minority for almost his entire tenure and the ad only reinforces that there is already dysfunction in Washington and that his anger was directed at the way business was conducted in Springfield.</p>

<p>An early October <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/house/il/illinois_12th_district_bost_vs_enyart-5014.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> conducted by We Ask America showed Bost with a slim lead in a district that has not supported Republicans in nearly three decades. Unemployment and health care loom as major issues in Illinois' 12th Congressional District, but how voters&nbsp;react&nbsp;to these ads, and the performance of Green Party candidate Paula Bradshaw, may very well decide this close race.</p>
