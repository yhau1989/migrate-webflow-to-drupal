<p>After three years of <a href="http://ca.gov/drought/" rel="noopener noreferrer">drought</a>, Proposition 1 will authorize $7.12 billion and reallocate $425 million of unused bonds to support water quality, storage, treatment, and supply through the development of a better supply infrastructure. The sale of general obligation (GO) <a href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/jtf/JTF_BondFinancingJTF.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">bonds</a> will fund the proposition’s projects only after a majority vote since each bond requires “full faith and credit” and an increase in taxes in order to repay.</p>

<p>The drought, according to the <a href="http://ca.water.usgs.gov/data/drought/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, is a symptom of reduced snow-pack that normally feeds runoffs which in turn becomes useable groundwater -- the implications of which affects crop yields, livestock, and potentially consumers, according to the <a href="http://ers.usda.gov/topics/in-the-news/california-drought-2014-farm-and-food-impacts.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>

<p>Proposition 1 will allow for the implementation and testing of pipelines, canals, and storage centers to support these needs. Ratified by the Assembly and the State Senate on August 13, 2014,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/pdf/ab-1471-chapter-188.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">AB1471</a>&nbsp;-- or Proposition 1 -- was brokered by Governor Brown as part of his <a href="http://resources.ca.gov/california_water_action_plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water Action Plan</a>.</p>

<p>Within the&nbsp;California's state legislature,&nbsp;<a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVersionsCompareClient.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">votes</a>&nbsp;in favor of&nbsp;the proposition were nearly unanimous across party lines with the&nbsp;only opposition from two&nbsp;assemblymen, Wesley Chesboro (D-Eureka) and Tim Donnelly (R-Hesperia). Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) highlighted the bipartisan nature of the bill in a comment to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/nation/california/2014/08/15/california-state-water-bond/14096953/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desert Sun.</a></p>
<blockquote>"The pitch now is you've got a united front. You got Northern, Central, South. You got Republicans, you got Democrats. You've got the Senate leadership, the Assembly leadership- both, you know, Republican and Democrat- and you got the governor."</blockquote>
<p>Individuals such as Sean Parker (co-founder of Napster) and organizations like the California Farm Bureau Federation have contributed <a href="http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/Campaign/Measures/Detail.aspx?id=1369617&amp;session=2013%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">funding</a> over $150,000 on average&nbsp;for the support of Proposition 1 -- totaling $6.6 million. The opposition’s contributors, such as the Jack Klein Partnership, have raised considerably less money with most donations averaging under $5,000&nbsp;and totaling $71,000, as reported by Ballotpedia.</p>

<p>Across many&nbsp;major Californian metropolitan areas approval remains only slight, with San Francisco and the Inland Empire at the highest -- 64 percent and 62 percent, respectively. Other areas, such as the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego,&nbsp;hover&nbsp;between <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140924140121/http:/ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_914MBS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">51 percent to 55 percent</a>&nbsp;approval.</p>
<h3><strong>PPIC Poll: Would you vote yes or no on Proposition 1?</strong></h3>
[bar_graph] [bar title="Democrats - Yes" percent="68" color="progress-bar-info" id="b1"] [bar title="Republicans - Yes" percent="44" color="progress-bar-danger" id="b2"] [bar title="No Party Preference - Yes" percent="59" color="progress-bar-success" id="b3"] [/bar_graph]

[social_blockquote quote="California's Prop. 1 has the support of 58 percent of likely voters." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295652167" handle="" hashes=""]Currently, the ballot measure has the support of 58 percent of likely voters with 29 percent against and 14 percent undecided, as reported by the <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140924140121/http:/ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_914MBS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Policy Institute of California</a>.*</p>

<p>During the PPIC’s survey, participants were asked whether or not the sale of bonds would affect voter opinion. Sixty-seven percent affirmed a yes vote regardless of an added bond measure to the ballot.</p>

<p>Financially, the sale of $7.1 billion in GO bonds will cost taxpayers $360 million a year for the next 40 years. The&nbsp;<a href="https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/files/biblio/Economic_Impact_of_the_2014_California_Water_Drought_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">drought</a> has cost the state millions&nbsp;in lost revenue with lost farm revenues ($810), livestock&nbsp;and dairy loses&nbsp;($203),&nbsp;and&nbsp;increased pumping fees ($454).&nbsp;The sale of bonds will reduce the cost of water-related projects for local governments, determined by the <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2014/prop-1-110414.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legislative Analyst's Office</a>.</p>

<p>Yes or no Californians will determine how California’s most vital resource, water, is handled. The burden that remains on voters’ shoulders is whether or not the expenditure now is worth the price later.</p>
