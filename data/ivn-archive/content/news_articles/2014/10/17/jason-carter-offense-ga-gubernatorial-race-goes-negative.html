<p>With less than 20 days until the election, the&nbsp;gubernatorial race in Georgia is heating up, with frontrunners <strong>Jason Carter</strong> (D) and <strong>Nathan Deal</strong> (R) both turning negative in a new wave of campaign ads.</p>
<p>Most recently to hit the airwaves is&nbsp;an attack from Georgia State Senator Jason Carter, who has up until now relied on positive ads and contrast pieces to appeal to voters. In his attack, Carter criticizes Deal for&nbsp;making $3 million while in office while the Georgian&nbsp;middle class suffers.&nbsp;He references the controversial sale of Deal's salvage yard business to a company that could owe the government as much as $74 million in back taxes.</p>

<p><span>“Nathan Deal. Putting money in his pockets, not ours,” the ad closes.</span></p>
<p>The negative ad comes shortly after a line of attacks from both Nathan Deal and the&nbsp;Republican Governors Association, aligning Carter with Obama on the issue of health care.</p>
<p>Carter has repeatedly <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/10/10/jason-carter-criticizes-obamacare-independents-listening/" rel="noopener noreferrer">distanced himself from Obamacare</a>, going so far as to even call it a mess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Anybody who looks at the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare or whatever you want to call it, has to recognize that it’s a mess,”&nbsp;- Jason Carter&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jimmy-carters-grandson-dodges-washington-path-georgia-governors/story?id=20894587" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite Carter's refusal to fully endorse Obamacare, the&nbsp;Republican Governors Association poured&nbsp;$500,000 in the original attack ad, which can be viewed here:</p>

<p>Carter's drastic shift from&nbsp;defense to offense this late in the election signals the increasingly hostile&nbsp;environment in Georgia. In what was previously a dead heat,&nbsp;Democrat&nbsp;Jason Carter is now&nbsp;two percentage points behind&nbsp;Republican Nathan Deal, with Libertarian candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/10/13/libertarian-candidate-andrew-hunt-shape-ga-gubernatorial-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Hunt</a>&nbsp;averaging&nbsp;around 5 percent in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/ga/georgia_governor_deal_vs_carter-3461.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent polls</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;race will ultimately come down to who can appeal to the 40 percent of Georgians who no longer affiliate with the two major political parties.</p>
