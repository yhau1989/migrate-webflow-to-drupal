<p>In an age where over <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/25/just-35-of-435-elections-competitive-after-201-years-of-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">90 percent</a> of elections are determined in the primary, it's a rare occurrence for candidates to focus on voters who are not affiliated with a political party during the general election.</p>

<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Republican and Democratic party registration across the country has <a href="ivn.us/2014/10/01/republicans-democrats-losing-battleground-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer">plummeted</a>, and turnout is likely to dip 10-20 percent compared to presidential election years, according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research.</a>&nbsp;With both of those factors in play,&nbsp;<strong>independent voters are primed to have a big impact this year.</strong></p>

<p>Below are the top five races from around the country where independent-minded voters will determine the outcome:</p>

[outset type="full"]
<h2>1. Kansas - Senate</h2>
[/outset]

<p>The Senate race in Kansas has become a national lightning rod. Press coverage of the race skyrocketed when the Democratic candidate, Chad Taylor, dropped out of the race, leaving <strong>independent candidate Greg Orman</strong>&nbsp;with a slight lead over incumbent&nbsp;<strong>Republican</strong> <strong>Senator Pat Roberts</strong>.</p>

<p>A legal <a href="ivn.us/2014/09/19/kan-supreme-court-says-democrat-chad-taylor-will-removed-senate-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">firestorm</a> ensued when Kansas' Republican secretary of state, Kris Kobach, initially opted not to recognize Taylor's withdrawal --&nbsp;a decision that was seen as <a href="ivn.us/2014/09/24/just-thought-madness-kansas-senate-race-gets-weirder/" rel="noopener noreferrer">politically motivated</a>. The Kansas Supreme Court overturned the decision and Taylor won't appear on the November ballot.</p>

<p><a href="ivn.us/2014/09/03/independent-greg-orman-becomes-us-senate-front-runner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polls</a> show Orman with an edge over Roberts by&nbsp;as much&nbsp;as 10 points. Likewise, Roberts' popularity has been waning in recent years. His approval rating stands at approximately 27 percent.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>If his campaign is successful, Greg Orman would become the third Independent in the U.S. Senate. The last time more than two non-major party candidates held the Senate floor together was in 1940.</p>

<h2>2. Georgia - Governor</h2>
[/outset]
<p>In a state that is historically conservative, a growing demographic shift in the electorate and peculiar election circumstances have sewn the seeds for a highly <a href="ivn.us/2014/10/07/independents-decide-carter-vs-deal-georgia-gubernatorial-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">competitive</a> November election between incumbent Republican <strong>Nathan Deal</strong> and Democratic State Senator&nbsp;<strong>Jason Carter</strong>.</p>

<p>Carter, who has bucked the Democratic Party's traditional line on issues like gun control and the Affordable Care Act, is in a dead heat with Governor Deal --&nbsp;each border on 43 and 45 percent in polls. The Peach State's closed party primary system advanced Libertarian Andrew Hunt to November as well.</p>

<p>Hunt has consistently polled near 6&nbsp;percent and has drawn the support of Deal's primary election opponent, former Dalton mayor David Pennington.</p>

<h2>3. California - Congressional District 52</h2>
[/outset]

<p>Congressional <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ca-52/" rel="noopener noreferrer">District 52</a>, located in San Diego, is shaping up as one of the most competitive in the country. Incumbent <strong>U.S. Representative Scott Peters</strong> defeated his Republican challenger and former U.S. Rep.&nbsp;Brian Billbray by less than two percent.</p>

<p>California's nonpartisan, top-two primary, held in June, resulted with Peters in first place at 42 percent and <strong>Republican Carl DeMaio</strong> in second with 35 percent.</p>

<p>DeMaio, a former city council member and 2012 candidate for San Diego mayor, paints himself as a 'Big Tent' conservative. He has emphasized socially tolerant policies and if elected, would be the first openly gay Republican congressman.</p>

<p>In a September interview for IVN, DeMaio <a href="ivn.us/2014/09/30/scott-peters-and-carl-demaio-vie-for-independents-cross-party-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “This is a seat that reflects the&nbsp;future of America and that is that we are fiscally responsible and socially accepting.”</p>

<p>“I think I’m a candidate that fits this district,” he added.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>Peters has campaigned on his record of working across the aisle with Republicans like U.S.&nbsp;Reps.&nbsp;Darrel Issa and Duncan Hunter. Both campaigns have traded jabs in recent weeks and as Election Day draws closer, competition for the district's independent voters (about 112,000 voters -- or 30% of the electorate -- according to the secretary of state) will continue to heat up.</p>

<h2>4. Colorado - Governor</h2>
[/outset]

<p>Colorado's gubernatorial race features a handful of candidates, all vying for the state's top office. Governor <strong>John Hickenlooper (D)</strong> and <strong>U.S. Representative Bob Beuprez (R)</strong> are neck-and-neck in the polls --&nbsp;often within 5 percent of one another.</p>

<p>However, three other candidates will appear on the November ballot: Libertarian Mathew Hess, Green Party candidate Harry Hempy, and&nbsp;Glendale Mayor&nbsp;Mike Dunafon and Paul Florino are running with no party affiliation as Independents.</p>

<p>When it comes to independent politicians, Mike Dunafon is in a league of his own. He’s the only gubernatorial candidate in the country with a campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wttpC_KvnB0" rel="noopener noreferrer">rap video</a>, which features Wyclef Jean, and maintains a larger social media following than all of his opponents combined.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>While the non-major party candidates haven't built much traction in the polls, they are leaving their mark on the race. The front-runners' attitudes on Colorado's recent legalization of marijuana has the potential to turn off voters who would have otherwise turned out in November.</p>

<p>Chances are the election will be decided within a tight margin and candidates like the pro-legalization Dunafon could make or break who becomes the next governor.</p>

<h2>5. Oregon - Measure 90</h2>
[/outset]

<p>Two measures to open up Oregon's closed primary elections were put forward earlier this year. In July, only one advanced to appear on the November ballot -- <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/16/initiative-adopt-top-two-open-primary-oregon-qualifies-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measure 90</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Measure 90</strong> would change the Beaver State's closed partisan primary system into a nonpartisan, top-two open primary. It would be similar to the primary systems in neighboring California and Washington state with a few key differences:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Party endorsements will appear on the ballot next to their endorsed candidate</li>
	<li>Requires more information be provided to voters on the ballot</li>
	<li>Oregon's current use of fusion voting, which allows multiple parties to nominate one candidate, will remain unchanged</li>
</ul>
<p>If Measure 90 passes, Oregon's 650,000 independent voters will&nbsp;have a&nbsp;chance to participate in the primary election for the first time without sacrificing their First Amendment right to non-association.</p>
