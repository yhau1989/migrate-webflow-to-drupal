<p>In the June 3 nonpartisan, top-two open primary, Californians chose&nbsp;Democrat Alex Padilla (30.2%) and Republican Pete Peterson (29.7%) to advance to the general election in the race for secretary of state. From a glance, both candidates look similar with platforms based on increasing voter participation (only 25.17% during the primary) and increasing transparency in the electoral&nbsp;process.</p>

<p>But, this highly competitive statewide race is attracting widespread attention.</p>

<p>Padilla has a slight edge less than a month ahead of Election Day. A September 9 <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2483.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field poll</a> shows him&nbsp;in the lead with 43 percent compared to Peterson’s 36 percent, with 21 percent undecided.</p>

<p>The race for&nbsp;California&nbsp;secretary of state features&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;who&nbsp;must not only remain active in pursuing increased voter participation through new technologies, but overcome growing voter apathy -- due, in part, to paralyzing partisanship at the national level. Voters cannot afford to ignore any race in the 2014 election, let alone an office that is responsible for influencing potential voter participation, registration, and business growth within California.</p>

<p>Both&nbsp;candidates have expressed publicly a need for the secretary of state to remain <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JktQlPGJ5qs%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">party-neutral</a> in carrying out the duties of the office. Peterson emphasized this point in an interview for IVN:</p>
<blockquote>"<em>I believe the secretary of state’s office should be run in a nonpartisan way, and I have an 8-year professional record in conducting nonpartisan public policy making processes."</em></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, each candidate plans to implement new technologies to the voter registration process. While Peterson has met with community leaders&nbsp;to develop&nbsp;solutions for low voter turnouts, Padilla has voted to enhance civic education in order to boost participation.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest contrast lies in their histories.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="With 21% still undecided,&nbsp;a recent&nbsp;poll shows Padilla leading in the Calif. SOS race with 43%." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295650880" handle="" hashes=""]<p><a href="http://www.padilla4sofs.com/voter_participation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Padilla</a> is a veteran public servant with credentials as a California state senator from District 20. He took office in 2010 and before that was a member of the Los Angeles City Council&nbsp;from 1999 to 2006.</p>

<p>As a senator, Padilla&nbsp;promoted <a href="http://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2014-04-02-senator-alex-padilla-issues-statement-regarding-us-supreme-court-decision-mccutcheon" rel="noopener noreferrer">reforms</a>&nbsp;such as SB 1101, a 100-day campaign contribution blackout, SB1102, a 24-hour disclosure of campaign contributions, and SB 1104, which requires public access to campaign communications to strengthen the<a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/%5C/index.php?id=51" rel="noopener noreferrer"> California Political Reform Act.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.petesos.com/bio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peterson</a> was the executive director of Common Sense California and later the Davenport Institute for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership. He has worked with multiple California civic leaders to promote public participation with programs&nbsp;such as&nbsp;"Public Engagement: The Vital Leadership Skill in Difficult Times."</p>

<p>Though he's inexperienced when it comes to public office, his private-sector credentials have been geared toward civic engagement. He has even called the secretary of state position a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JktQlPGJ5qs" rel="noopener noreferrer">"dream job"</a> and promises measurable and efficient actions if elected to office.</p>
<h3><strong>Thursday Night&nbsp;Debate</strong></h3>
<p>A debate on Thursday, October 9,&nbsp;promises an in-depth look at the candidates for this highly contested position. The debate will take place at UC-Berkley and will be moderated by John Myers with a statewide live stream starting at 6:30 p.m. PDT.</p>

<p>Expected topics will most likely cover the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/admin/about-the-agency.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">responsibilities</a> of the secretary of state tied to recent voter turnout or how each candidate plans on&nbsp;implementing new technologies. Both candidates will use this opportunity to differentiate themselves from their opponent and align non-affiliated voters to their campaign.</p>

<p>For some voters, the race may come down to issues other than voting. Voter attitudes on California’s <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2473.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a> and <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2475.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">wealth disparity</a> are likely to play a role.</p>

<p>Peterson's promise to streamline&nbsp;the process required to open a business and strengthen&nbsp;California's economy&nbsp;has been a defining characteristic of his campaign. He&nbsp;has often&nbsp;cited anecdotal <a href="http://pep.petesos.com/topics/14019/problems-with-the-sos-office-for-small-business-owners" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaints</a> by small business owners regarding the current state-managed business environment.</p>

<p>Padilla’s voting <a href="http://votesmart.org/candidate/59742/alex-padilla?categoryId=&amp;type=V,S,R,E,F,P,E,E,E,E,E&amp;p=7%23.VCRaxjKYaM8%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">record</a>&nbsp;boasts plenty of&nbsp;support for <a href="http://votesmart.org/bill/18423/48816/59742/alex-padilla-voted-yea-passage-sb-935-increases-the-minimum-wage%2348816" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum wage increases</a>, corporate tax amendments, <a href="http://votesmart.org/bill/13448/35288/59742/alex-padilla-voted-yea-passage-sb-469-requirements-for-expansion-by-large-retailers%2335288" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictions on superstores</a>, and <a href="http://votesmart.org/bill/12038/32069/59742/alex-padilla-voted-yea-concurrence-vote-sb-1391-business-tax-incentive-amendments%2332069" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax incentive amendments</a>. This will most likely&nbsp;gain favor with voters concerned about the growing wealth disparity in the state.</p>
<p><span>Experience level and party affiliation aside, both candidates are civically-minded, but only one will be the next secretary of state.</span></p>
