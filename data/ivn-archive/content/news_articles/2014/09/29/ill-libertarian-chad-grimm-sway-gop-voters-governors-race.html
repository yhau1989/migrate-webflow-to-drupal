<p>It is still unlikely that Libertarian <strong>Chad Grimm</strong> will become Illinois' 42nd governor, but as the only other <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/25/illinois-libertarian-party-appear-ballot-third-parties-term-limits-rejected/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">choice</a> on the ballot, his candidacy may soon take on a new phase.</p>

<p>Republican Party nominee Bruce Rauner has long been considered suspect among the state's pro-life activists. In one instance, the newly-minted general election nominee skipped an Illinois Right-to-Life dinner and instead <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/14/bruce-rauner-abortion_n_5324221.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">attended</a> a pro-choice&nbsp;event for the ACLU.</p>

<p>That suspicion increased over the weekend when Rauner's wife granted an interview to NBC Chicago and <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/mrs-rauner-both-candidates-are-pro-choice.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said this</a> about her husband:</p>
<blockquote>"You can trust him that no way he will ever let something happen to our reproductive rights. . . . I think this is a great opportunity, in this race, where we don't have to actually think about the social issues, because both candidates are pro-choice."</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Rauner's interview is not entirely surprising. Throughout the campaign, Bruce&nbsp;Rauner has typically been coy about his abortion views. He and others are on record saying&nbsp;Rauner is essentially "<a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/08/mark-kirk-reinterates-support-for-bruce-rauner-because-he-is-pro-choice-video.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-choice</a>."</p>

<p>One time when the candidate gave a relatively straightforward answer on the topic in 2013, he <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/03/rauners-own-words-on-the-topic-of-abortion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"The reality is that the right for a woman to choose is a national law. That's not going to change in Illinois. I think we can agree on some common sense ways for abortion to be more rare and safe."</blockquote>
<p>Former Illinois U.S. Representative Joe Walsh, who now hosts a radio show, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-kelly/rep-joe-walsh-says-he-can_b_5360515.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> recently:</p>
<blockquote>"He's (Rauner) gonna reach a point where if he continues to ignore and insult conservatives, eventually conservatives&nbsp; reach a point where they just say, that's kinda like the final thing."</blockquote>
<p>However, Walsh, who took an unequivocal anti-abortion stance in his failed 2012 re-election bid, also said that it all comes down to&nbsp;boundaries.</p>

<p>"If Rauner were anti-Second Amendment, I could not support him," he remarked.</p>

<p>The anxiety many Illinois Republicans have over Rauner and his abortion position may ultimately lead portions of the GOP coalition to support another candidate. To that point, in a Facebook post over the weekend, Chad Grimm, gubernatorial candidate for the Libertarian Party,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/grimmforgovernor/posts/778268765545179" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"I am pro life, as I believe there should be no crime so long as no one is harmed and I consider the murder of an unborn child as the worst kind of harm committed on the most innocent among us!"</blockquote>
<p>Grimm's brief statement seems to borrow from some pro-life activists' language that the right-to-life is a <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pro-life-organizations-engage-the-un-human-rights-council" rel="noopener noreferrer">human</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA_Yl_JCdFg" rel="noopener noreferrer">right</a> with abortion akin to <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2013/09/12/former-abortion-doc-abortion-is-murder-society-cant-go-on-this-way/" rel="noopener noreferrer">murder</a>. Grimm&nbsp;has not spoken on abortion yet during the campaign, so it is difficult to see how it might play out.</p>

<p>Grimm has polled equally well among independents and Democrats. However, if he emphasizes his pro-life position he has the possibility to peel off some disgruntled Republican voters.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="By emphasizing his pro-life stance, Libertarian Chad Grimm could win over disgruntled GOP voters in Illinois." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295651095" handle="" hashes=""]By most accounts, the Illinois governorship should be one for the Republicans to win. Pat Quinn squeaked to victory to a full term in 2010. In that election, Quinn won only 4&nbsp;of Illinois' 102 counties. However, one was Cook, the most populous, where he won resoundingly.

<p>In that election, Libertarian candidate Lex Green <a href="http://www.elections.illinois.gov/ElectionInformation/VoteTotalsList.aspx?ElectionType=GE&amp;ElectionID=29&amp;SearchType=OfficeSearch&amp;OfficeID=5370&amp;QueryType=Office&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> over 34,000 votes: more than the difference between Quinn and his GOP challenger. If it is assumed that all Libertarian voters would otherwise vote Republican --&nbsp;a questionable claim --&nbsp;then the Libertarian vote is hardly negligible.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom suggests that focusing on divisive social issues is an electoral <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/27/opinion/zelizer-gop-social-issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer">loser</a>. Polls have shown <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/168071/are-most-americans-really-pro-life" rel="noopener noreferrer">variety</a> on the split between pro-life and pro-choice preferences, but the <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/how-to-win-a-culture-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer">trend</a> holds that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/154838/pro-choice-americans-record-low.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">roughly</a> half of respondents identify as pro-life.</p>

<p>Rauner has largely eschewed this part of the electorate in pursuit of independents and cross-over Democrats. However, the numbers show that his campaign has simply failed to attract these voters and finish off a vulnerable&nbsp;incumbent.</p>

<p>On at least one item, Mrs. Rauner is correct. Social issues have not played a role in this race. Jobs and underfunded pensions have been the key talking points for both major candidates.</p>

<p>Despite that, Rauner has been having difficulty uniting his party. Polls continue to indicate that the general election is a <a href="http://www.mystateline.com/fulltext-news/d/story/latest-poll-shows-illinois-governors-race-a-toss-u/26876/XHKkhJaYnEK_s7xnUdR6Hw" rel="noopener noreferrer">close</a> affair, but most show Rauner <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/il/illinois_governor_rauner_vs_quinn-4224.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading</a>&nbsp;by only three to five points against the generally <a href="http://wgnradio.com/2014/09/14/rick-pearson-chicago-tribune-polls/" rel="noopener noreferrer">unpopular</a> Quinn.</p>

<p>Through it all, Grimm might have an opportunity to show that&nbsp;his party, often seen as&nbsp;liberal on social issues, can run a pro-life candidate. It may also be a chance to <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/lila-rose-i-would-leave-the-republican-party-if-it-dropped-social-issues-106623/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test</a> the <a href="http://familyfoundation.org/2012/11/time-for-pro-lifers-to-leave-the-republican-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposition</a> that pro-lifers and other disgruntled conservatives will not <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/republican-stepchildren/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave</a> the GOP because there is no other <a href="http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/the-city-gates.cfm?id=356" rel="noopener noreferrer">place</a> to go.</p>
