<p>In his latest video for the Truth in Media project, <strong><a href="http://benswann.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Swann</a></strong> takes a closer took at the medicinal benefits of CBD oil, which has already been proven to prevent epileptic seizures. CBD, which was introduced into the mainstream on Dr. Sanjay Gupta's CNN investigative report, <em>Weed</em>, is one of several cannabinoids found in a marijuana plant and may hold several more medical benefits than just helping people with Epilepsy.</p>

<p>Cannabis -- and all forms of the plant -- are still classified as Schedule I drugs with the federal government. Not only does this mean Cannabis is illegal, but the government says it has no medicinal value at all.</p>

<p><em><strong>Keep in mind, while states like Washington and Colorado have legalized marijuana, it is still technically illegal in these states because state law never trumps federal law.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, Swann's investigation discovered something interesting: While federal law says Cannabis has no medicinal value, the federal government itself does not really believe this. According to Swann, the Department of Health and Human Services filed for two patents: one for the use of cannabinoids for medicinal purposes and the other for Cannabis oil to treat diseases.</p>

<p>To be clear, there is growing evidence that Cannabis oils can be used not only to prevent seizures for people with Epilepsy but can be used to treat Alzheimer's, autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease, cancer, and other serious medical conditions. The Department of Health and Human Services must believe this because they filed a patent for the use of Cannabis and Cannabis oils for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>And yet, a medical benefit that could help millions of people is kept out of their reach because the government says it has no medical benefits and can be abused and therefore must remain illegal. And because it is illegal, the government will arrest, prosecute, and imprison people who want to use Cannabis oils to treat their life-threatening medical conditions.</p>
