<p>How did the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) obtain an armored vehicle? Through the Department of Defense's <a href="http://www.dps.mo.gov/dir/programs/cjle/dod.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Excess Property Program</a>. The program donates unused equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies who submit requests. SDUSD did not have to purchase the vehicle, but had to pay a $5,000 shipping fee to deliver it to San Diego.</p>

[gravityform id="53" name="Militarization of local governments" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]Specifically, it is a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle (MRAP) which has been used by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by SWAT teams around the country. An MRAP is valued around $730,000, but again, it was donated. The district also plans to store donated medical supplies in the vehicle.

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://inewsource.org/2014/09/09/why-did-san-diego-unified-acquire-an-armored-vehicle/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iNews Source</a>,&nbsp;the SDUSD Police Department stated that it was obtained for emergency purposes. Captain Joe Florentino said, <em>"Our idea is ‘How can we get in and pull out a classroom at a time of kids if there’s an active shooter? If there’s a fire, if there’s an earthquake, can we rip down a wall?’ Stuff like that.”</em></p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Hopefully, we never have to use it for the real deal." author="Police Captain Joe Florentino, San Diego Unified"] The vehicle is being stored in a garage at my old stomping grounds of Samuel F.B. Morse High School.&nbsp;Morse's auto collision and refinishing program worked on repainting the vehicle.

<p>Florentino is aware that it may raise red flags, but he stated, "Hopefully, we never have to use it for the real deal."</p>

<p>SDUSD consists of 226 schools with 132,000 students in total. It is the second largest school district in California with an operating budget of $1 billion.</p>
