<p>As Illinois Republican gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner receives unpleasant polling news, his state party may also face a federal investigation.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Stories about armed men confronting Libertarian ballot signers have circulated for months." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295650334" handle="CarlWicklander" hashes=""]A few weeks ago, the Illinois Libertarian Party (LP) <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/25/illinois-libertarian-party-appear-ballot-third-parties-term-limits-rejected/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified</a> for statewide ballot access, but on Friday, Illinois LP candidate for attorney general, Ben Koyl, formally <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/illinois-libertarians-file-federal-ballot-access-complaint.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed</a> a complaint with the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department. The complaint surrounds whether the Illinois Republican Party utilized intimidation tactics against petition signature collectors for the LP.</p>

<p>The Rauner campaign has long denied any connection to intimidation tactics. However, stories about armed men confronting LP ballot signers have <a href="http://politics.suntimes.com/article/springfield/under-gun-petition-challenges/wed-08202014-801pm" rel="noopener noreferrer">circulated</a> for months.</p>

<p>The Illinois Republican Party <a href="http://politics.suntimes.com/article/springfield/rauner-firing-blanks-flap-over-hired-gun-ballot-challenge/tue-08262014-837pm" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired</a> lawyer John Fogarty to challenge LP ballot signatures. Fogarty's firm hired Morrison Security "to help build a case against the Libertarian petitions," according to the Chicago Sun-Times.</p>

<p>After first saying it was normal for Morrison Security investigators to carry firearms on the job, the Illinois GOP later <a href="http://politics.suntimes.com/article/springfield/rauner-firing-blanks-flap-over-hired-gun-ballot-challenge/tue-08262014-837pm" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "We do not support the practice of any investigator wearing a firearm while verifying petition signatures."</p>

<p>In his statement, Koyl <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/illinois-libertarians-file-federal-ballot-access-complaint.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he is hoping the U.S. Department of Justice will:</p>
<blockquote>"Investigate this matter to ensure that citizens who run for public office and those who assist them can exercise their First Amendment rights without fear of intimidation or deception."</blockquote>
<p>The Rauner campaign announced it was committed to seeing as many people participating in the political process as possible.</p>

<p>Koyl continued by <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/illinois-libertarians-file-federal-ballot-access-complaint.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"If this is true, we expect [Rauner] will 'walk the talk' and publicly announce his support to stop the Republican Party of Illinois' continuing ballot-blocking efforts and welcome Libertarian candidates into all upcoming debates."</blockquote>
<p>Koyl earlier <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-ibendahl/illinois-libertarians-lod_b_5737462.html?utm_hp_ref=chicago&amp;ir=Chicago" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> his complaints about intimidation to the Cook County State Attorney's office and the Illinois Attorney General's office, but <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/illinois-libertarians-file-federal-ballot-access-complaint.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> no response.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Latest @chicagotribune poll has Gov. Quinn at 48%, Rauner at 37%, and libertarian Grimm at 5%." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295650334" handle="" hashes=""]The news of a potential federal investigation for the Illinois GOP is only the first leg of trouble for Rauner's campaign. After leading most polls since his primary victory in March, Rauner has found himself trailing incumbent governor Pat Quinn in a couple recent ones.

<p>A Democratic Governors Association poll conducted by the Global Strategy Group <a href="http://capitolfax.com/2014/09/11/democratic-poll-quinn-leads-rauner-and-grimm-43-40-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a> Quinn leading among likely voters 43-40, with LP candidate Chad Grimm receiving 5 percent. It also shows Rauner failing to attract independents or lure Democrats to switch sides.</p>

<p>A separate Chicago Tribune poll also <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/quinn-surges-ahead-by-11-points-in-new-poll.html#more" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed</a> Quinn leading Rauner 48-37 with 5 percent for Grimm. Troubling Rauner in the Tribune poll is that Quinn is viewed as more trustworthy than him. Rauner, a political newcomer, has been <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/09/tribune-poll-internals-matter-too.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized</a> for tailoring his campaign to polling data.</p>

<p>Bruce Rauner is not implicated in any wrongdoing regarding intimidation, but it serves as a distraction in a campaign that is quickly tightening.</p>
