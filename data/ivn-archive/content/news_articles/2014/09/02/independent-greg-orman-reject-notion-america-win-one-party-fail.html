<p>Upon receiving his official endorsement from Women for Kansas, independent U.S. Senate candidate Greg Orman spoke before the group on why he entered the race and about the major themes of his campaign.</p>
<blockquote>"I believe the only way we can get Congress back to working again is to cast off partisan labels and preconceived notions and focus on problem solving," Orman exclaimed. "I believe we need to reject the notion that there are only two solutions to every problem. We need to reject the notion that for America to win, one party must fail. We need to reject the zero sum politics of today and return to a time when leadership trumped ideology."</blockquote>
<p>Orman also reflected on the fact that it is difficult to understand an independent in a partisan environment. Major parties usually end up identifying independents with opposing political extremes because they don't know how to run against an independent.</p>
