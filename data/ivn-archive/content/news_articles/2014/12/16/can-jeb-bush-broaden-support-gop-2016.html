<p>Are people surprised that <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> is planning to run&nbsp;for president? No. For many politicos, it was all about who was going to pull the trigger first: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, or <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>? After months of toying with media outlets over an indecision to run, Bush beat Clinton to the punch.</p>

[advertisement title="" type="outset"]"In January, I also plan to establish a Leadership PAC that will help me facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation," Bush said in a <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/jeb-bush/a-note-from-jeb-bush/619074134888300" rel="noopener noreferrer">note on Facebook</a>. "The PAC’s purpose will be to support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans."</p>

<p>Prepare to hear the word "dynasty" a lot over the next two years because that is how the media is going to frame the election: the two biggest political dynasties in America, the Clintons and the Bushs,&nbsp;are fated to go head-to-head in the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>First, consider how important social media has become. A big name like Bush announced he was exploring the possibility of running for president in a Facebook note and 111 characters on Twitter. And in a matter of minutes, news outlets nationwide and around the world jumped on it. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeb_Bush#2016_presidential_election" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia page</a> has already been updated with the information.</p>

<p>While the media will be focused on the dynasty angle of this story, Bush could shift the dynamics of the 2016 presidential race dramatically. Like his brother, George, Jeb could&nbsp;potentially divide the Hispanic vote enough to make Republicans competitive with minority voters. He is also not popular with tea party and far-right conservatives, who want someone like Ted Cruz to run for president, and has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/us/politics/jeb-bush-takes-aim-at-fellow-republicans.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">openly criticized</a> the Republican Party for its&nbsp;shift further to the right:</p>
<blockquote>Speaking at a breakfast with national reporters held by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Bloomberg View Web site.">Bloomberg View</a>&nbsp;in Manhattan, Mr. Bush questioned the party’s approach to&nbsp;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_and_refugees/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="More articles about immigration.">immigration</a>, deficit reduction and partisanship, saying that his father, former President George Bush, and Reagan would struggle with “an orthodoxy that doesn’t allow for disagreement.” - Jim Rutenberg, New York Times</blockquote>
<p>Is this an indication that Bush could draw in people outside the Republican Party in his campaign for the White House? Possibly. For primary opponents, immigration is going to be a major point of attack, and how Bush responds could make or break his campaign -- both in the primary and the general election if he wins the nomination.</p>
