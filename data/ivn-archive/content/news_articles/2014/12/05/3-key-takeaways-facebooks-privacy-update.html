<p>[social_blockquote quote="Facebook's new privacy policy is 70% shorter than the old one." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295654955" handle="" hashes=""]Facebook has announced, yet again, that it will be updating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/terms-updates/?notif_t=data_policy_notice" rel="noopener noreferrer">its privacy terms</a>&nbsp;effective January 1, 2015.</p>
<p><span><em>The good news?</em> Facebook's new policy is 70 percent shorter than the old one.&nbsp;</span><em>The bad news?</em> Not a whole lot will change to protect your privacy online.</p>
<p><span>Here are 3 key takeaways from Facebook’s updated privacy terms: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>[heading title="(1) Facebook’s privacy settings are so difficult to navigate, they’re now offering an interactive guide for users " subtitle=""]</p>
<p><em><span>"Privacy Basics offers interactive guides to answer the most commonly asked questions about how you can control your information on Facebook.”&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span>While it is a step in the right direction, the fact that the&nbsp;default privacy setting was ever this ambiguous&nbsp;raises some serious questions about Facebook’s transparency in the area of privacy online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What Facebook <em>does</em> outline in its&nbsp;new terms is how it&nbsp;is using your location-based check-ins to better provide you with localized content. You can always choose not to have Facebook know your location by editing your privacy settings in your mobile device.</p>
<p>[heading title="(2) Facebook “Buy” button could indicate future user-to-user transactions " subtitle=""]</p>
<p><span>Facebook announced that starting January 1, it&nbsp;will be testing a Buy button that will "help people discover and purchase products without leaving Facebook.” Along with beta testing a Buy button, Facebook is “working on new ways to make transactions even more convenient."</span></p>
<p><span>Remember Facebook’s recent and overly aggressive push to get all users on a&nbsp;stand-alone Messenger App? Well, it could just be part of a larger strategy to introduce user-to-user mobile payments, Fast Company’s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3036695/fast-feed/this-is-why-facebook-was-so-aggressive-about-migrating-users-over-to-messenger" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Gayomali</a> suggests. Leaked screenshots show&nbsp;Facebook has been testing a payment functionality in&nbsp;Messenger, Gayomali explains. Coupled with Facebook’s recent hiring of PayPal P</span>resident David Marcus, this could prove to be part of Facebook’s mobile payment plan.&nbsp;{<a href="https://venmo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Think Venmo</i></a>}</p>
<p>[heading title="(3) Choices you make about ad visibility now apply on all devices " subtitle=""]</p>
<p><em>"When you tell us you don't want to see these types of ads, your decision automatically applies to every device you use to access Facebook."</em></p>
<p>This is a good thing for both you and advertisers. Now, you will&nbsp;no longer see ads you are not interested in, and advertisers will no longer pay to show you ads you've already expressed&nbsp;you have no interest in. It's a win-win.</p>
