<p>It's been a while since Mexico has caught the attention of U.S. manufacturers attempting to shrink their costs. However, this is quickly changing.</p>

<p>The main reason is that wages have almost quadrupled in China in the last 5 years, while Mexico did not see a significant hike. Also, since Americans are the main consumers of these companies, it is cheaper to transport products from Mexico.</p>

<p>So why did these companies not leave China and return to the U.S.? Some manufacturers, such as General Electric and Caterpillar, have returned home. However, according to a Boston Consulting Group <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/04/25/us-manufacturers-more-competitive/8143611/" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, Mexico has gained more competitiveness than the U.S. in recent years.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="3 major exporters outpaced the U.S. in improving cost efficiency: Mexico, India, and the Netherlands. " hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295645315" handle="" hashes=""]According to the survey, electricity costs rose 66 percent in China, which is more than double the increase in the United States (30%). The start of large-scale U.S. shale gas production in 2005 has helped contain electricity bills in the United States and neighboring Canada and Mexico. However, Mexico has other advantages like cheap labor.

<p>The survey also concluded that three major exporters outpaced the U.S. in improving cost efficiency: Mexico, India, and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>At the same time, the following countries can manufacturer products cheaper than the United States: Indonesia, India, China, Thailand, Taiwan, Russia, and -- you guessed it -- Mexico. The trend, however, is that China will no longer be cheaper soon and Mexico no longer relies solely on low-skill manufacturing.</p>

<p>Tijuana became an ideal location for high-tech manufacturing companies based in San Diego. One example is 3D Robotics, a company that <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/business/la-fi-overseas-manufacturing-20131130" rel="noopener noreferrer">makes drones</a> and electronic parts for American consumers.</p>

<p>Last year, direct foreign investment in Mexico reached a record $35 billion. Rampant bureaucracy and government inefficiency may give some American investors a headache. Yet, there are market-oriented reforms taken by Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto that may get a positive reaction from major enterprises.</p>
