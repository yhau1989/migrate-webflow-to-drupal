<p>Is there a way to end gridlock forever? What about gerrymandering, closed primaries, and high-barrier requirements for outsiders? Even then, what about the complete dependence candidates have on a tiny group of funders that have corrupted our government?</p>

<p>When considered all together, we are back to a time of taxation without any meaningful representation. A conclusion that a&nbsp;recent&nbsp;<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/princeton-scholar-demise-of-democracy-america-tpm-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Princeton study</a> resoundingly confirms.</p>

<p><span>[pullout_blockquote quote="IndyAlliance.US is an experiment to see if at least one percent of independents will re-declare their independence from modern-day colonial rulers by midnight July 4." author=""]A wave of bold upstart independents from across the U.S. believe there is way to restore representation to the people and that 2014 is the year to launch their strategy.</span></p>

<p>At noon eastern time on June 11, these congressional candidates will&nbsp;pull the wraps off of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indyalliance.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndyAlliance.US</a>, an experiment to see if at least one percent of independents in the US will re-declare their independence from the modern-day colonial rulers by midnight July 4.</p>

<p>Independents are notoriously hard to organize because they are, well... independent. Yet, something is changing in the United States.</p>

 showing how disenfranchised Americans are with the political establishment, the country is moving toward unanimity on at least one issue: [social_link quote="The Congress we have now does not represent the people." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295644104" handle="BruceSkarin" hashes=""]<p>With <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/04/25/majority-americans-say-major-parties-dont-represent/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_home&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll after poll</a></p>

<p><span>In response to this upheaval, these smart and savvy political outsiders have answered the call for creating comprehensive reform. To be successful, however, voters need to be able to see the big picture. </span>One of the most common arguments against supporting independent candidates is: “What difference will one independent representative make?”</p>

<p>Currently, there are <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/cong.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>zero</b> independents</a> in the U.S. House and only two in the U.S. Senate. Will adding one more make any difference?</p>

<p>The truth is, it would be really tough, because the rules in Congress strongly reinforce a two-party system by requiring any independent to caucus with a major party. As it stands now, a few representatives and another senator will not be enough to hold any real leverage over the establishment.</p>

<p>So why support an independent if the "lesser of two evils" can at least be effective on some issues?</p>

<p><span>IndyAlliance.US is setting out to provide a fairly simple, yet&nbsp;highly effective answer.&nbsp;</span>What exactly do these independents have in store?
