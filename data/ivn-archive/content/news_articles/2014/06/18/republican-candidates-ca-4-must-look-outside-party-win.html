<p>California’s primary system was initiated to curb the well-established partisanship in state politics. Following the 2012 elections, the first under the new primary, the state’s strong Democratic lean resulted in a super majority in the state Legislature for Democrats.</p>

<p>Consequently, Republicans will need to rethink how to be competitive in a state with a voting population that is 45 percent Democratic and 20 percent No Party Preference. Yet, the&nbsp;current civil war plaguing the party may significantly lower chances of a successful Republican rebirth.</p>

<p>So, where does this leave voters?</p>

<p>In California's 4th Congressional District, voters are faced with such an intra-party showdown. Incumbent Tom McClintock (R) will take on Art Moore (R) in November's general election. While McClintock remains&nbsp;a tea party favorite, his challenger has portrayed&nbsp;himself as a moderate alternative for voters.</p>

<p>Although McClintock earned&nbsp;more than half of the primary&nbsp;votes, <a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2014/06/tom-mcclintocks-gop-clinches-spot-in-november-election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moore</a>, a military veteran, remains hopeful since he appeals&nbsp;to voters outside of his own political party.</p>

<p>Voters in District 4 are faced with&nbsp;a unique opportunity this fall. Unlike in 2012 election, the primarily Republican district will not have a landslide victory in favor of the incumbent simply because of the R next to his name.</p>

<p>Instead, voters are now able to distinguish between degrees of conservatism in addition to truly focusing on each candidate's merits.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;new California primary system, the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of partisanship, and thus calls for moderate candidates or candidates who appeal to a larger variety of voters. Thus, with Jeffrey Gerlach (NPP) pushed out of the general election, almost <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/California's_4th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014" rel="noopener noreferrer">21.6 percent </a>of voters are left to choose between the more ideologically-focused McClintock or the more moderate Moore.</p>

<p>This could force McClintock to change his strategy in reaching voters on a wider level.</p>

<p>Although McClintock's campaign&nbsp;is skeptical of a real challenge to the seat, they have&nbsp;gone on record, commenting on Moore's advance into the general election with, "Moore is Less." Moore's campaign remains hopeful as&nbsp;many of these Northern California voters express their discontent with McClintock's track record.</p>
