<p>The U.S. has resumed drone strikes in Pakistan, ending a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/06/us_launches_first_dr_2.php?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=us-launches-first-drone-strike-in-pakistan-in-6-months" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-month</a>&nbsp;moratorium that was put in place to facilitate&nbsp;peace talks between the Pakistani government and jihadist groups.</p>

<p>This week, Pakistan commenced <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/06/pakistan_launches_co.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Zarb-e-Azb</a> in North Waziristan, a tribal area in the country's northwest frontier region that Islamist groups have used as a base to conduct operations in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The military is seeking to root out rebels from groups that launched an <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/06/pakistani_taliban_la.php?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pakistani-taliban-launch-assault-on-karachi-airport#" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack</a> on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on June 8, 2014. All ten attackers died in the assault that left 18 others dead, including 11 security workers.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The Pakistani government has peace agreements — even de facto alliances — with groups it considers the 'good Taliban'" author="Andrew Gripp, IVN contributor"] In the first half of 2014, Pakistan held dialogues with the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Taliban&nbsp;(TTP), also referred to as the Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani government regards&nbsp;the TTP as part of the “bad Taliban” because the group routinely launches attacks against Pakistani civilians and security personnel and aims to&nbsp;overthrow the&nbsp;government&nbsp;and replace it with a theocratic state.

<p>Yet the Pakistani government has peace agreements — even de facto alliances — with groups it considers the “good Taliban,” including the Haqqani Network and the Gul Bahadar Group, both based in North Waziristan. These groups do not threaten&nbsp;the Pakistani government and instead aid&nbsp;the Afghan Taliban by coordinating&nbsp;attacks against American, international, and Afghan national forces.</p>

<p>Strong <a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10538/pakistans-afghanistan-plan-strategic-depth-2-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence</a> suggests that agencies within the&nbsp;Pakistani government actively support the “good Taliban” as proxies in a long-term effort to engineer a Pashtun-dominated neighbor in Afghanistan once international forces withdraw -- a policy&nbsp;referred to as “strategic depth.”</p>

<p>The U.S. does not subscribe to the “good Taliban," “bad Taliban” distinction, since both factions are committed to thwarting Afghanistan’s movement toward democracy and to undermining international efforts to train a self-sufficient Afghan security force.</p>

<p>Talks between the government and the TTP stalled in early spring.</p>

<p>In April 2014, the TTP chose not to renew a 40-day ceasefire. In May, via a rare video statement, TTP&nbsp;leader Maulana Fazlullah effectively killed the prospects for peace when he <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/710157/new-video-mullah-fazlullah-says-govt-army-must-accept-gods-writ/" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> that Pakistan must accept the “writ of Allah” and adopt the Taliban’s strict interpretation of <em>shari'a</em>.&nbsp;He also encouraged suicide attackers to prepare operations against “forces that transgress the limits set by God.”</p>

<p>The TTP, along with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), claimed responsibility for the Karachi assault that occurred just weeks later.</p>

<p>Fazlullah, who became the TTP’s leader after a U.S. drone strike killed former head Hakimullah Mehsud in 2013, is a long-time enemy of Pakistan and the U.S.</p>

<p>Fazlullah battled the Pakistani military between 2007 and 2009 for control of the Swat Valley region. Though Fazlullah won autonomy in the region in 2009, he subsequently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/iron-fist-maulana-fazlullah-20131171538269715.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">violated</a> the terms of the peace agreement and invaded neighboring districts. At one point, his forces came within 60 miles of the capital Islamabad.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Unlike Pakistan, the U.S. makes no distinction between 'good Taliban' and 'bad Taliban.'" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295644914" handle="" hashes=""]In 2012, Fazlullah <p><a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2012/10/mullah_fazlullah_ordered_assas.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered</a> the assassination of several Pakistani schoolgirls for their "campaign against Islam &amp; Shariah" and their indirect support of the "<span>Murtad [infidel] army and Government of Pakistan." Malala Yousafzai was one of the schoolgirls targeted following this injunction.</span></p>

<p>Fazlullah has also offered sanctuary to al-Qaeda. One of his former deputies, Ibn Amin, led a brigade of the al-Qaeda force called the Shadow Army, which is active across Afghanistan. The U.S. killed Amin in a drone strike in 2010.</p>

<p>The June 2014 drone strikes that ended the U.S.’s moratorium following the stillborn peace talks targeted both “good” and “bad” Taliban and Taliban-allied groups.</p>

<p>The first strike killed several Uzbeks who were&nbsp;alleged members of&nbsp;the IMU.</p>

<p>Hours later, on the morning of June 12, another <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1112253" rel="noopener noreferrer">strike</a> killed several “good Taliban” members, including Haji Gul, a commander from the Haqqani Network, as well as commanders active in the Afghan Taliban. The strike destroyed vehicles carrying explosives that were likely being&nbsp;readied for deployment across the border in Afghanistan.</p>
