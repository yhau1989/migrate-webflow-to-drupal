<p>In a Michigan race with a potentially embattled incumbent, two pro-business groups have recently thrown support to the challenger.</p>

<p>This past week, Republican Justin Amash's challenger, Brian Ellis, <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20140612/NEWS06/306120187/primary-Amash-Ellis-business-chamber-endorsement" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> the endorsements of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the Michigan Farm Bureau. However, this came after the news that Justin Amash leads in a new poll.</p>

<p>In its endorsement, a senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.michamber.com/michigan-chamber-endorses-brian-ellis-us-house" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Brian Ellis' 30-year business career includes running his own financial advisory firm and serving as president of his own food processing business that employed over 200 people."</blockquote>
<p>Another VP said, "We can trust Brian Ellis to support and vote for policies that promote America's free-enterprise system."</p>

<p>In accepting these endorsements, Ellis <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/06/challenger_brian_ellis_continu.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"I think these entities see me in a 30-year career in business and know about pro-growth policies . . . that Justin hasn't supported. The approach of Justin Amash of just saying 'no' is not a solution to solve anything."</blockquote>
<p>Many <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/21/amash-face-primary-challenge-shutdown-vote/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">businesses</a> in the district and throughout the state appear to be amassing around Ellis. However, Amash continues to get support from at least one wealthy family in the district, the <a href="http://www.dbdvfoundation.org/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeVos</a>, which includes a former president of Amway.</p>

<p>In his campaign, Ellis has criticized Amash's vote <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/04/challenger_brian_ellis_attacks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">against</a> a balanced budget amendment and a present against the Keystone XL <a href="http://ivn.us/search/keystone+pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer">pipeline</a>. He has also made a point of some alleged inconsistencies on Amash's abortion stance, which has <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/07/justin_amash_loses_right_to_li.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously cost</a> the congressman the support of the Michigan Right to Life Committee.</p>

<p>In defending his opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline and in certain abortion-related legislation, Amash has <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/05/rep_justin_amash_breaks_with_p.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> that he votes present when the bills single out a particular company or entity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The charges against Amash of ideological heresy are not new. He was <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/07/rep_justin_amash_most_liberal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> the "most liberal Republican" by political strategist Karl Rove, in part because Amash frequently votes against his party.</p>

<p>Still, according to OpenCongress.org, Amash <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/412438_Justin_Amash" rel="noopener noreferrer">votes with</a> Republicans approximately 80 percent of the time. Plus, he has received <a href="https://twitter.com/repjustinamash/status/354445546192248835" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect scores</a> from the Club for Growth, the Cato Institute, and the <a href="http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/105566/justin-amash#.U55aEyiTK8A" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Right to Life Committee</a>.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Amash votes with Republicans approximately 80% of the time." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295644778" handle="OpenCongress" hashes=""]Ellis' recent endorsements come slightly less than two months before the August 5 primary. However, they do not necessarily demonstrate a narrowing of the margin the challenger faces.

<p>A recent <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/06/poll_rep_justin_amash_leads_pr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> conducted by Michigan Information and Research Service (MIRS), an independent firm, found Amash leading Ellis 42-23, with 35 percent of participants undecided. Six thousand likely Republican primary voters were called and 472 responded.</p>

<p>Donald Zinman, a political science professor at Grand Valley State University, <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/06/poll_rep_justin_amash_leads_pr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">believes</a> "Amash might have the upper hand" because primaries typically bring out the most enthusiastic supporters. With so much time left before voting, Zinman also said the 19-point lead was significant, although "if he had a 20-point lead the weekend before the election, it'd be all over."</p>

<p>Amash, who recently set a <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/justin-amash-and-steve-womack-just-set-a-new-record-in-congress-20140530" rel="noopener noreferrer">record</a> alongside Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack (R) for the longest streak of consecutive congressional votes cast among current representatives, is known to be tireless.</p>

<p>As an incumbent, Amash has several built-in advantages. As the endorsements pile up for his opponent, he will likely need voter enthusiasm to successfully fend off this challenge. However, since Justin Amash leads in a new poll, the electoral momentum still appears to be with him.</p>
