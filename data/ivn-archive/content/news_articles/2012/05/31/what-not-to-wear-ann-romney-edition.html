<p>Since we started our blog, Kym and I have been dying to showcase the best and worst dressed of the political world. To start things off, here's a recent image of Ann Romney on CBS This Morning wearing a $990 Reed Krakoff silk shirt.</p>

<p>I don't necessarily have a problem with the price tag on this blouse. Michelle Obama often times departs from her J.Crew stylings and opts for designer brands. What I find interesting is the hybrid of a fish and a bird nestled into her armpit. Maybe she is trying to soften Mitt's image as a rigid and serious politician by wearing a "fun" blouse on national television. Maybe she is trying to appeal to the female voters, who Romney is struggling to win over.</p>

<p>I'm personally not a fan, but at least she's not afraid to wear bold prints, right?</p>
