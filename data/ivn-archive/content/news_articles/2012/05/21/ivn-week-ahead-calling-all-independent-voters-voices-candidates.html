<p>California's June 5th <strong>Open Primary</strong> is now <strong>16 days</strong> away! <strong>May 21st</strong> is the deadline to register and/or change your political affiliation. Remember, this year's Open Primary makes it possible to vote for any political candidate regardless of party affiliation (except for Presidential primary, which remains partisan).</p>

<p>This week marks the last few days of our <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/voter-survey-timeline/" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent Voter Survey</a></strong>, made possible and secure by Everyone Counts. There's still a few days to cast your vote, if you have not already. Make sure to check back with IVN on <strong>May 22nd</strong>, we'll be excited to share the results!</p>

<p>IVN's theme for the coming week is <strong>candidates</strong>. What candidates are on your radar? Have any independent candidates, state, local or nationwide, caught your attention? How about partisan candidates who buck the party line to do what's right? We want to spotlight and discuss interesting political candidates moving this country forward.</p>

<p>Have you checked out our new <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/election-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election Center</a></strong>? We're keeping you up-to-date with <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/races-to-watch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Races to Watch</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/candidatesearch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Candidate Search</a></strong> and a comprehensive guide to the two ballot initiatives appearing on California's June ballot: <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/proposition-28-term-limits/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 28</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/proposition-29-additional-tax-on-cigarettes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 29</a></strong>. Come learn, debate and exchange ideas at IVN in the run-up to this historic election!</p>
