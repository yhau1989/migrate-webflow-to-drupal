<p>Residents of Washington D.C. came up with a clever response to Arizona Congressman Trent Franks after he proposed a 20-week abortion ban and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/23/trent-franks-dc-abortion-ban-protest_n_1539830.html?ref=tw" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied the district's only elected representative</a>, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, from testifying against the measure.</p>

<p>Protestors deemed Congressman Franks, "Mayor" Franks and on Wednesday brought to his office a flood of municipal complaints.</p>

<p>"From potholes to rodent problems to public transportation complaints, DC residents have followed Franks' lead and begun funneling their problems to him rather than the city's own government," according to <a href="http://jezebel.com/5912790/arizona-congressman-who-proposed-dc-abortion-ban-gets-hilarious-payback-from-pissed-off-dc-residents" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jezebel</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday's protest was organized by DC Vote, an advocacy organization aiming to secure full representation for D.C. in Congress, and Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington.</p>
