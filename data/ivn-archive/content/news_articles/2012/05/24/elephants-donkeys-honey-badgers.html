<p>So we asked our loyal Facebook Fans what animal should represent Independents, and got some interesting responses...</p>

<p><strong>Most Popular Response:</strong>&nbsp;Owl <em>"because we are wise"&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Close Second:</strong>&nbsp;Eagle&nbsp;<em>"signifying its freedom from the tyranny of the two party dictatorship"&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Honorable Mention:</strong>&nbsp;Tyrannosaurus Rex with robotic gun arms</p>

<p><em></em><strong>Personal Favorite:</strong> The honey badger because they're the world's most fearless creature</p>
