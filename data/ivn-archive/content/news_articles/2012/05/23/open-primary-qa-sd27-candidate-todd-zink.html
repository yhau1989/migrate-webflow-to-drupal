<p><em><em>The following Q&amp;A is with Republican Todd Zink, candidate for </em>California State Senate District 27.</em></p>

<p><strong>Are you personally in favor of the new open primary system?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zink:</strong> Yes</p>

<p><strong>In your opinion, what are the top issues for this election cycle in California?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zink:</strong> Job creation, improve our economy through improving the business climate, strengthen education and ensure our public safety.</p>

<p><strong>How does your message appeal to Californians who identify as "No Party Preference" or are undecided?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zink:</strong> All of my top issues are nonpartisan issues that effect every single person living in California.</p>

<p>Currently the state is failing at all of them.</p>

<p>The state has the highest taxes in the nation and little to show for it.</p>

<p><strong>How are you adjusting your campaign outreach and messaging to reflect the wider demographic of voters you now have to appeal to in the primary?</strong></p>
<div><strong>Zink:</strong> I strongly believe that my emphasis on focusing on the basics of good governance by taking care of these nonpartisan priorities appeals to all demographics of voters.</div>
