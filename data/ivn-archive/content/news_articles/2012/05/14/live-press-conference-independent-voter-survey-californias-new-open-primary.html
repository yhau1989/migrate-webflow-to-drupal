<p>At 11am PST, the Independent Voter Project and the Independent Voter Network will go live from San Diego to announce the details of the unprecedented Independent Voter Survey and the historic June 5th Open Primary in California. Watch on direct from Ustream from anywhere in the country.</p>

<p>The Independent Voter Network will be conducting an online voter survey, open to all non-partisan voters in select districts where independent voters are likely to have a big impact in California's June 5th primary. Every independent voter in the district will receive a mailer with a unique ID that will allow him or her to participate anonymously and securely in the survey. More information on the Independent Voter Network's Independent Voter Survey can be found <a href="http://ivn.us/voter-survey-timeline/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
