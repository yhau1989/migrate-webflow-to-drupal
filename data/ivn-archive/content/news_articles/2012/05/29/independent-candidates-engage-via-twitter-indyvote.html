<p>Today we hosted our second tweet chat, this time inviting independent-minded candidates and voters. Nine independent-minded candidates participated: Phil Dodds, Jack Todd Arnold, Maurice Duhon, Linda Parks, Chad Condit, Anthony Adams, Eric Reyes, William "Cleave"&nbsp;Drummond, TJ O'Hara.</p>

<p>This was a unique opportunity for an open discussion among independents from across the country.&nbsp;Topics included: legalizing marijuana, the Occupy Movement, innovation in campaigning tactics, the rise of independent candidates and voters, overcoming hyper-partisanship, and individual reasons for rejecting the two party duopoly. Over the course of an hour, independents had an open forum to discuss their views, opinions, and frustration with partisan politics.</p>

<p><em>Here are some of the highlights from today's chat:</em></p>

<p><strong>The first question came from John Spicer, a political enthusiast living in Wilmington, North Carolina.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523indyvote" rel="noopener noreferrer">#indyvote</a> How would you propose to eliminate the national debt?
