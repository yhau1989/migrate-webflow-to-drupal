<p><strong>UPDATE: IVN Tweet Chat begin at 11:00am PST (2pm EST). </strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: IVN Tweet Chat is scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, 2012 at 11:00am PST (2pm EST). Hashtag has changed to #indyvote.</strong></p>

<p>One of our main goals here at the Independent Voter Network is to get independent voters more involved in the political system. We want to give you the same opportunities as Republicans and Democrats and provide you with a platform to voice your opinion.</p>

<p>One way we've done this in the past is by hosting a discussion on Twitter, inviting anyone and everyone who wants to join in.&nbsp;And since our first tweet chat was such a&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/15/21777/" rel="noopener noreferrer">success</a>, we have decided to host another one, this time putting you in direct contact with independent candidates. We have prepared a list of questions to ask both independent voters and candidates, and have invited independents from across the country. We'll be giving you the opportunity to ask these candidates anything about their campaigns, the struggles of running as an independent, and their plan to get out the vote. And while we'll be moderating, we're relying on you to lead the discussion!</p>

<p><strong>What’s a tweet chat?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A tweet chat is an online conversation surrounding a specific topic. This pre-arranged chat takes place on Twitter and usually has a moderator and a hashtag. In our case, we will be moderating the event and we have chosen the hashtag&nbsp;<strong>#indyvote</strong>.&nbsp;We have prepared a series of questions that we will ask over the course of the hour. Remember, because it’s on Twitter, all responses must be 140 characters or less, but feel free to send multiple tweets. We want to hear anything and everything you have to say!</p>

<p><strong>How do you participate?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to follow us on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/IVNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">@IVNetwork</a>. From there, you have two options on how to participate:</p>

<p><strong>(1) TweetChat:</strong>&nbsp;I would recommend using the client&nbsp;<a href="http://tweetchat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TweetChat</a>, which allows you securely log-in, enter a hashtag to follow, and then converse in real-time with other independent voters just like you. We have chosen the hashtag&nbsp;<strong>#indyvote</strong>, and if you are using TweetChat, each tweet will automatically get the hashtag <strong>#indyvote</strong>&nbsp;added to it. TweetChat also allows you to pause the chat, making it easier for you to respond to individuals or us.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Twitter:&nbsp;</strong>Sound complicated?&nbsp;You can also just sign in to your Twitter account and enter in the hashtag&nbsp;<strong>#indyvote</strong>&nbsp;in the search bar at the top right. This will let you follow the conversation without signing into a third party service like TweetChat, but it might have a delay. When you see a question or response you want to “tweet” about, just compose a new tweet and add the hashtag <strong>#indyvote</strong>&nbsp;at the end. Your tweet will then be part of the conversation!</p>

<p><strong>Why you should join in!</strong></p>

<p>To voice your opinion! Both Democrats and Republicans have the backing of a party and are provided with a multitude of platforms like national conventions, forums, rallies etc.to discuss their party politics, while independent-minded voters are often times silenced. We want to open up the dialogue to independent-minded voters, like you, who have political opinions and want to voice them. This is an opportunity for you to join in the discussion, communicate with independent candidates and voters, and ask the questions you want answered.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact us in advance if there is a topic you want covered, and we will make sure to include it in the chat!</p>

<p><strong>We're inviting independent candidates, voters, politicians, and you! &nbsp;Hope to see you there!&nbsp;</strong></p>
