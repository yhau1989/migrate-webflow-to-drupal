<p>On May 7, 2012 voters can began voting in California’s first “Top Two Open Primary”. Previously, candidates running for office appeared only on their own party ballot. Now, under the “Top-Two Open Primary Act”, all candidates running, regardless of their party preference, will appear on a single combined ballot. For the first time, voters can also select a “No Party Preference” candidate in the primary election. This change gives voters the option to select a Moderate candidate that balances the views of both parties. In office, a “No Party Preference” candidate holds a powerful split vote to break stalemates between the parties. This vote can be instrumental in passing budgets, approving projects, and making decisions.</p>

<p>I am the “No Party Preference” candidate for the United States House of Representatives California District 7. This new district represents the Sacramento County Suburbs. It’s a more compact district and was designed by the Citizen’s Commission for Redistricting to eliminate the gerrymandering which snaked the previous district all the way to the Nevada border. In my opinion, it’s a better district for the voter because it is centered in Sacramento County to more effectively represent the needs of a growing suburban population.</p>

<p>As the “No Party Preference” congressional candidate, I am focused strictly on addressing our economic recovery and not on fighting political ideology. My goals for my first term are: 1) Create jobs by landing a company headquarters along the Hwy 50 and 99 corridors, 2) Reduce commutes by building a bridge across the American River between Watt and Sunrise, and 3) Interconnect Elk Grove to El Dorado via a byway. These important tasks have been delayed by a lack of leadership and I intend to complete them.</p>

<p>To create jobs for our area, I recently wrote George Lucas, director of the Star Wars movie series, to invite him to locate his new Lucas Films digital arts campus at Mather Field or at the recently annexed expansion of Folsom. This was in response to an announcement George Lucas made titled, “Lucas Films pulls out of Marin.” As Congressman, I will continue to invite employers like Lucas Films to locate here and do everything I can to retain the employers we already have. This is what cities are doing to bring in employers. This is what Chicago did to encourage Boeing to move its headquarters there from Seattle. This is what I will do for the Sacramento region if elected your Congressman. Please consider a “No Party Preference” candidate this election and break the party stalemate so we can get down to business.</p>
