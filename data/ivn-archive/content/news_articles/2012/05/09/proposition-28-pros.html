<ul>
	<li>Proposition 28 permits politicians to stay in the Assembly for 12 years, up from the 6-year maximum allowed currently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Proposition 28 permits politicians to stay in the Senate for 12 years, up from the 8-year maximum allowed currently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Lawmakers can serve a combination of time in both houses, to the 12 year limit. Two years less than the current cap of 14.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Politicians would be allowed to serve longer terms if Proposition 28 passes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Proposition 28 does not affect current officeholders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Terms limits, as they are now, do more harm than good. Proposition 28 would slow down turnover.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>As the <a href="http://www.marinij.com/opinion/ci_20534647/editorial-ij-backs-props-28-and-29-june" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marin Independent Journal</a> assesses, assembly members have little time to learn about Sacramento before it is time again to leave office. They are also forced to constantly be in campaign-mode.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Changing term limits would allow lawmakers to tackle long-term problems in California.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>People with the most power in Sacramento get to stay without limits: lobbyists, staffers, bureaucrats, and more. Term limits, as they are, have expanded lawmaker dependence on staffers and lobbyists, as the <a href="http://www.newsreview.com/chico/prop-28-will-fix-term/content?oid=5891224" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chico News and Review</a> points out.</li>
