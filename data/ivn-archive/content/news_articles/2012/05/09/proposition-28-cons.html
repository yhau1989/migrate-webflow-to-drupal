	<li>Proposition 28 permits politicians to stay in the Senate for 12 years, up from the 8-year maximum allowed currently. For those lawmakers who stay in the Senate, their tenure would be prolonged.</li>

	<li>Vast majority of politicians currently in Sacramento would be allowed to serve longer terms if Proposition 28 passes.</li>

	<li>Proponents of Proposition 28 are not being truthful with what the ballot measure achieves. "Prop. 28 is designed to trick voters into thinking it strengthens terms limits when it does the opposite," says <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/05/01/EDDH1OBOHF.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Fleischman in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.pe.com/opinion/editorials-headlines/20120430-state-no-on-prop.-28.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press-Enterprise Editorial Board</a> does not support Proposition 28 on the ground that "California does not need to tinker with legislative term limits right now. The state should see how well impartial redistricting and nonpartisan primaries work before considering lesser changes."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/terms-351396-years-prop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orange County Register</a> is unsupportive: "Most legislators serve their time in Sacramento in one house or the other. The proposition would extend those tenures considerably. If voters want to reduce the time politicians hang around in Sacramento, Prop. 28 isn't the solution."</li>
</ul>
