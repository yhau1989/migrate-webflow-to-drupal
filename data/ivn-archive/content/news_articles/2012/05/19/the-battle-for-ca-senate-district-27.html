<p>With just over two weeks until the California primary, statewide campaigns for Senate, Assembly and Congress are accelerating at full speed, preparing for what will likely be a very close election.</p>

<p>Of particular interest is Senate District 27,&nbsp;a seat currently held by Republican&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/senator-tony-strickland/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Strickland</a>.&nbsp;Strickland, however, has decided not to run in the district and has instead opted for a run in the incumbent-free&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/29/open-primary-creates-winners-and-losers-in-ca-26/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressional District 26</a>.</p>

<p>This leaves the race open to <strong>Democrat Fran Pavley</strong> and <strong>Republican Todd Zink, </strong>who are the sole competitors in the district.</p>

[caption id="attachment_23976" align="aligncenter" width="534" caption="Both Fran Pavely (left) and Todd Zink (right) will have to appeal to independents in order to win in November."][/caption]<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SDD27.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="417" src="cloudinary://SDD27.png" width="534"></a></p>

<p>Known for her environmental work, Pavley&nbsp;has served three terms in the State Assembly and in 2008 was elected Senator of California's 23rd district,&nbsp;encompassing&nbsp;parts of Los Angeles and Ventura County.&nbsp;Zink, on the other hand, is a former Marine with a background in public service and safety. The first line on his campaign website reads "Sacramento is broken, and it needs to be fixed," a message resonating deeply with voters tired of partisan politics.</p>

<p>Because this seat is currently held by a Republican, it would be a big win for Democrats, who are tirelessly fighting for the 27 member seats they need to maintain a majority. Reversely, it would produce a net loss for Republicans, forcing the party to snatch a Senate seat from a Democratic district elsewhere.</p>

<p>Amid talk of a possible run in the district, former Assembly Speaker&nbsp;Bob Hertzberg described the district:</p>
<blockquote><em>"It's a moderate district. It's a district with a lot of small business that are interested in the jobs and the economy."</em></blockquote>
<p>So while there are only two candidates vying for this seat, both of which will surely advance to November, the role of independent voters makes this race interesting.&nbsp;In order to beat Pavley in the general election, Zink will have to win the majority of Decline to State votes in November, a strategy he must start now. If he doesn't begin to attract the DTS vote now, he will not have the resources to target them in November.</p>

<p>For Zink, money will be an obstacle. Pavley, as the incumbent, has a big advantage in fundraising, with almost $694,931 on hand (reports&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/districts/SD27/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Around the Capitol</a>).</p>

<p>Voter registration presents another obstacle for Southern California Republican, with roughly 35% of the district registered Republican. In comparison, 41% of voters have registered as Democrats and 20% are without a party affiliation. This 6 point lead by Democrats makes the "No Party Preference" voters absolutely crucial for Republicans if they want to hang on to this seat.</p>

<p>The pressure mounted on the Democratic Party to reach the magic number 27 will lead to a fierce battle for the independent vote, one that will force both candidates to step outside their party affiliation in order to appeal to the independent voice.</p>
