<p><em>No on Prop. 29 (or Californians Against Out-of-Control Taxes and Spending) Proponents/Funders: Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds, and more. Complete list can be <a href="http://www.noon29.com/about-us" rel="noopener noreferrer">found here</a>.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Proposition 29 would raise tax on cigarettes sold in California by $1 a pack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Proposition 29 uses new tax revenues for a narrow purpose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If passed, Proposition 29 could allow tax dollars to fund out-of-state research.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The revenues from the increase in cigarette tax would be used to create a new bureaucracy in the state.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The new state agency would replicate functions and funding of the federal entity <em>National Institutes of Health</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Proposition 29 creates a large new medical research program, <em>California Cancer Research Life Sciences Innovation Trust Fund</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Potential for lack of accountability with the new agency's <em>Cancer Reseach Citizens Oversight Committee</em>, a 9-member board consisting of three University of California chancellors, three from state's cancer centers, physician from a California Academic Medical Center and two members from advocacy groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.modbee.com/2012/05/03/2185423/no-on-prop-29-bad-governance.html#storylink=cpy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacramento Bee Editorial Board is against Proposition 29</a> specifically due to accountability questions, citing: "There would be an annual audit of the agency, but no clear way for the state — the Legislature, the governor or anyone — to fix any flaws or problems that became evident."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>California's Legislative Analyst's Office predicts the tax would raise $735 million a year, but this figure would likely decline in future years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>25 cents per pack of cigarettes under the state's current cigarette tax already goes to tobacco education programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/27/opinion/la-ed-prop29-20120427" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a> does not support the measure, claiming: "It just doesn't make sense for the state to get into the medical research business to the tune of half a billion dollars a year when it has so many other important unmet needs."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>While modeled after Proposition 71, which created a stem-cell agency with $3 billion in bond funding eight years ago, the older initiative provided a defined amount of money for research. Proposition 29 would spend more. In contrast, as the LA Times points out, Proposition 71 also "created a structure under which the state and its taxpayers could <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/27/opinion/la-ed-prop29-20120427" rel="noopener noreferrer">share in royalties and licenses</a> from new discoveries."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>There can be no changes made to the Act by the Cancer Research Citizens Oversight Committee for 15 years.</li>
</ul>
