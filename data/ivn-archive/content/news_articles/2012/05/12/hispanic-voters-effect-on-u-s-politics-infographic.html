<p>The following infographic shows clearly how important Hispanic voters will be in the 2012 election, and&nbsp;elections&nbsp;to come. As the largest growing demographic in America, 12 million&nbsp;Hispanic registered&nbsp;voters are expected to turn out for the 2012 election. This number will continue to grow, and both parties hope to capture as much of the Hispanic vote as possible. They will undoubtedly tailor their&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;strategies&nbsp;to target this huge demographic.</p>
