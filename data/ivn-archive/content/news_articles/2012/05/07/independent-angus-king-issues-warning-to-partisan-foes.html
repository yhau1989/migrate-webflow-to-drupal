<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/us/politics/senate-control-could-hinge-on-angus-king-of-maine.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> reported this weekend on former two-term Maine governor <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/angus-king/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus King</a> and his independent run for Senate. King's warning, “I will take note of how I am treated in this campaign.”</p>

<p>As the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/us/politics/senate-control-could-hinge-on-angus-king-of-maine.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Times</a> put it,</p>
<blockquote><em>"That is not an idle threat from some quixotic candidate for the seat being vacated by Maine’s famously moderate Republican, Olympia J. Snowe. It is a warning from the front-runner, a two-term independent governor who, because he refuses to say whom he would support for majority leader next year, may well decide which party controls an evenly divided Senate."</em></blockquote>
<p>Is Gov. King referring to <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans</a>, or <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrats</a>, or both? It's no secret the decision to run by the well-regarded Gov. King caught many off-guard. No more so than the Democrats who expected to pick up a super important Senate seat.</p>

<p>But he'll win. And burning bridges in a defensive act to preserve their status quo could result in an even bigger headache when the new legislative class opens in 2013.</p>

<p>We've already seen the DCCC on attack in California, targeting Ventura County Supervisor and independent congressional candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/linda-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Parks</a>. She's running in <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/cd-26/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CD-26</a>, against incumbent Republican State <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/tony-strickland/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Tony Strickland</a> and a crowded field of four Democrats. Supervisor Parks is outspent in the race, yet Washington D.C. partisans still feel the threat of an independent infiltrating their coveted congressional ranks. Why welcome a representative seeking bipartisan cooperation, when there is plenty of money to go around falsely equating her to the Tea Party?</p>

<p>In a situation like the Senate, even one new lawmaker can challenge the balance of power. In the House, there are currently zero non-partisans serving as representatives, out of 435. After November, this could change. Democrats and Republicans alike do not know how to respond to this reality. They're out-of-touch, but this isn't news.</p>

<p>This past weekend, Angus King had the guts to say what many independent candidates and independent voters are thinking. Electing non-partisan alternatives returns the voice to the people, by taking power from party bosses and backroom deals. Their pre-determined candidates are facing unexpected, and intelligent, challengers. Remember, our current leadership, as compiled by these subversive forces, have a 10% approval rating. To use a boxing analogy, both public and private partisan leaders know they are on the ropes. Nasty mailers and television attack ads are already targeting these strong independent voices.</p>

<p>That may turn out to be a mistake when it comes time for legislative business.</p>
