<p>Candidates and campaigns are all in full swing. Indiana, North Carolina and West Virginia all host primary elections on Tuesday. Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana and the most senior member of the Republican Party in the Senate is facing an <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/04/poll-shows-lugar-facing-uphill-climb/" rel="noopener noreferrer">uphill battle for reelection</a>. He trails tea party-backed Richard Mourdock and, among other things, has been accused of being "too moderate and too willing to work with Democrats," <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/06/ahead-of-the-curve-the-next-7-days-80/" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to CNN</a>.</p>

<p><strong>April Job Numbers Disappoint</strong></p>

<p>April employment figures came in on Friday, showing 115,000 jobs created. The numbers were disappointing for most economists and analysts. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/jobs-report-any-way-you-dissect-it-the-recovery-has-been-soft/2012/05/04/gIQAjtdB1T_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>'s Brad Plumer examines the apparent slowdown of job growth, "If we keep adding 206,000 jobs per month, then it will take eight years and six months to reach what is considered full employment (somewhere between 4 and 6 percent)."</p>

<p>Looking forward, new figures for consumer confidence and the April U.S. Producer Price index are slated for release this coming Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Election Focus On Europe</strong></p>

<p>Economic woes (last week was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/06/us-usa-stocks-weekahead-idUSBRE8431PU20120506" rel="noopener noreferrer">particularly bad</a> for Wall Street) and decisive elections seen as referendums on austerity policies have drawn attention to Europe this month. Nicolas Sarkozy was officially defeated today by Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande. During his victory speech, Hollande declared austerity as a policy for economic recovery is "<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0506/Hollande-wins-French-presidency-signals-revisit-of-austerity" rel="noopener noreferrer">not inevitable</a>". At the same time, Chancellor Angela Merkel saw her party, Christian Democrats (CDU), lose integral footing in the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/06/germany-schleswig-idUSL5E8G603Y20120506" rel="noopener noreferrer">northern Schleswig-Holstein region</a> of Germany.</p>

<p>In Greece, the two established political parties that make up the current coalition government <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/06/world/europe/greece-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed to garner a majority of votes</a>. The left-leaning PASOK, who won 44% of the vote in 2010, is projected at just 13.7%. Instead, fringe political groups took larger slices of the electorate, signalling the malcontent of Greeks with their current political leadership and economic condition. With stronger-than-usual showings were the far-left coalition <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/06/world/europe/greece-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syriza</a>, far-right Golden Dawn party, right-wing nationalist Independent Greek party and the Communist Party. More than likely, a new coalition government will have to be formed.</p>

<p>It is yet to be seen what effect these election results have on global finances but watch for when markets open on Monday in the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/united-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States</a>. More information may arise from a gathering in Florence this week for the State of the Union Conference and another in London for the Bellweather Europe Conference, to examine the future of the European Union. Certainly, Sunday's results will be a topic for discussion. On Friday, the European Commission will also publish their spring forecast for 2012-2013.</p>
