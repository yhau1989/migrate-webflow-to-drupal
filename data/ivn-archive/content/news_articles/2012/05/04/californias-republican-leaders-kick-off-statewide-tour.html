<p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/california-republican-convention/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Republican Party</a> Chairman Tom Del Beccaro was in Sacramento yesterday to kick off a statewide tour focused on putting a stop to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/14/gov-brown-reaches-deal-with-millionaires-tax-backers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Gov. Brown Reaches Deal With Millionaire Tax Backers">Governor Jerry Brown’s ballot tax proposal</a>. He was joined by State Senate Republican Leader Bob Huff, State Assembly Republican Leader Connie Conway, Jon Coupal (President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association), and other Republican members of the Legislature.</p>

<p>The “Right Track, California” tour was announced just one day after CEO Magazine ranked California the nation’s worst place to do business- making it 8 years in a row now.</p>

<p>Del Beccaro aims to engage with voters on California’s high unemployment numbers and other critical issues plaguing the state. He will be sharing the CRP’s proposals for fixing California, and how they differ from those put forth by state Democrats.</p>

<p>“Voters aren’t just concerned about their taxes being raised, they’re increasingly worried that the money they do send to Sacramento is not being used wisely,” said Del Beccaro in a prepared statement.&nbsp;“Governor Brown and the Democrats in the Legislature are talking about High Speed Rail and other lofty programs. It’s time to get back to basics. And get people back to work. And that starts right here in Sacramento.”<strong></strong></p>

<p>The tour by train has planned stops across <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a>, starting in the Central Valley. Stops will be made today in Bakersfield and Fresno.</p>
