<p>When the nation's farmers started experiencing labor shortages last year they didn't know what to expect for the future; for many, the situation was without precedent. <a href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2012/04/26/1917673/pasco-farmer-abandons-asparagus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early indicators</a> for the 2012 season don't bode well for the nation's specialty crop growers who rely mainly on human labor instead of power-driven machines to bring their produce to market. No one is hitting the panic button just yet, but the situation is a bit scary.</p>

<p>According to Seattle NPR affiliate <a href="http://www.kplu.org/post/washingtons-asparagus-farmers-face-labor-shortage" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPLU</a>, growers in Washington State are now plowing under large portions of their asparagus acreage because they can't find enough hands to harvest the labor-intensive crop in a timely manner. The situation in Georgia is so bad that state officials <a href="http://www.pba.org/post/amid-farm-worker-shortage-prisons-coordinate-growers" rel="noopener noreferrer">have asked</a> its prison population to pick a vast crop of onions.</p>

<p>The ensuing farm labor shortage begs an important question: in a nation with so many jobless claims, why are there so many unfilled jobs?</p>

<p>“These are jobs that frankly, Americans don’t want to do,” offered Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing last week.</p>

<p>Touche.</p>

<p>With the flow of migrant workers from Mexico into the U.S. slowing to a trickle (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-30/immigration-stalls-as-opportunities-wane-on-u-dot-s-dot-mexican-border" rel="noopener noreferrer">if not reversing</a>) and a seemingly self-aggrandized work force – too far removed from its agrarian roots to even notice that there is a problem afoot – 2012 might break the <a href="http://ivn.us/2011/11/16/farm-exports-remain-a-bright-spot-for-u-s-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">boom trend</a> that the agriculture sector has been experiencing for the past few years.</p>
