<p>According to a recent Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project&nbsp;<a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Online-Pictures/Additional-Material-and-Demographics.aspx?view=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>, 16% of online users are active on the social network Twitter, with the majority of users aged 18-29 years old. Young adults were also the most active on the social networks Instagram and Tumblr, while LinkedIn saw popularity from users aged 30-49 years old.</p>
