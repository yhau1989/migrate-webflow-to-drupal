<p>Did you follow Day 1 of the Democratic National Convention? Much like the "We Built It" phrase that echoed through the halls of Tampa, Democrats had their own arsenal of words, repeating keywords and phrases throughout the night's events. The New York Times put together <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/04/us/politics/democratic-convention-words.html?smid=tw-nytimes" rel="noopener noreferrer">this visual</a> to track the words being used at the Democratic Convention and their frequency.</p>
<p>The New York Times has also included <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/04/us/politics/democratic-convention-words.html?smid=tw-nytimes" rel="noopener noreferrer">excerpts</a> from convention speeches so far, including this quote from Independent Governor of Rhode Island,&nbsp;Lincoln Chafee:</p>
<blockquote><em>There's nothing moderate about our love of country or our passion for America's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/04/us/politics/democratic-convention-words.html?smid=tw-nytimes#Future" rel="noopener noreferrer">future</a>. (Applause.) There's nothing moderate about our desire to work together within the broad political center in which most Americans live.</em></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>As an independent voter, do any of these messages appeal to you?</strong></em></p>
