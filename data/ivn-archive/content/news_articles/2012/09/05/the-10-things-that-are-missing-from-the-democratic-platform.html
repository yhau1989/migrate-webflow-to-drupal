<p>The Democratic 2012 Platform was released on Monday and some commentators have already highlighted that two&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;words were absent: GOD and Jerusalem. Are there other things missing from the Democratic platform?</p>

<p>As a french observer, here are the 10 things that I think are missing from the Platform and whose absence has not been discussed by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>The Democratic platform should have &nbsp;mentioned:</p>

<p>- We the People Built This.</p>

<p>- The United States in the best hope for mankind.</p>

<p>- Capitalism is American. Everything else is European socialism.</p>

<p>- Our Founding Fathers are rolling in their graves a lot.</p>

<p>- America is exceptional and deserves beatification.</p>

<p>- That the "Invisible President" have the right to an invisible&nbsp;White&nbsp;House and invisible Air Force One.</p>

<p>- The &nbsp;unalienable right to life on Wall Street shall not be infringed.</p>

<p>- That online gun sales should be&nbsp;deregulated&nbsp;in order to help save the US Postal.</p>

<p>- That biological differences between men and women should be abolished.</p>

<p>- Freedom of all religions to accept Jesus Christ as our savior.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you think there are other important words that are missing from the 2012 Democratic Platform?</p>
