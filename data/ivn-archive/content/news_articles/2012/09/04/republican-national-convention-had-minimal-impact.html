<p>According to the latest from <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/157256/gop-convention-romney-speech-evoke-lukewarm-reactions.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a>, last week's Republican National Convention had "minimal impact" on the voting population in America, with similar numbers reporting to be less likely to vote for candidate Mitt Romney after the RNC, than those reporting to be more likely to vote for him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When compared to previous Republican conventions, the 2012 RNC had a net impact of +2, the lowest impact since 1984. In 2008, the Democratic Convention was hailed a success, with Democrats generating a net impact of +14, with Obama going on to win the election.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Any predictions on the effectiveness of the Democratic National Convention this year?</strong></em></p>
