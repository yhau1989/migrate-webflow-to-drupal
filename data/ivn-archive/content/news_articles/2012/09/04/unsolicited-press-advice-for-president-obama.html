<p>There seems to be a large quantity of news and commentary out in the past few days highlighting all the things President Obama <em>must</em> do. This is timed just as the Democratic Party takes center stage this week at their national convention. If the President should heed the advice of anyone, surely it is the political media with their approval rating fluctuating at or below that of Congress. It seems that if the <a href="http://www.politico.com/arena/?hp=ar" rel="noopener noreferrer">political media are unhappy</a>, they have resolved to torture the rest of us with this less-than-earnest advice for President Obama.</p>

<p>Here is a collection of some of the best headlines <em>from today alone</em> telling the President what he should do.</p>
