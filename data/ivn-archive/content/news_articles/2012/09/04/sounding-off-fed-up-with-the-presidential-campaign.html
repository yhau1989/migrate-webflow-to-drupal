<p>Politico's <a href="http://www.politico.com/arena/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Arena</a> asked current and former policymakers today, "<a href="http://www.politico.com/arena/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fed up with the presidential campaign?</a>". The question is in relation to a recent story at the political network on <a href="http://politi.co/NacwIU" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporters' disdain</a> for the current national election cycle.</p>

<p>One quote from <a href="http://www.politico.com/arena/perm/Former_State_Rep__Jason_Grill_0A04F35E-1D11-4ACA-8DE3-37C7B0EECCB7.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">former Missouri State Rep. Jason Grill</a> was particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote><em>I think the silent majority of America is completely fed up with partisanship and shares the same sentiment with the political reporters on this presidential campaign.</em>

<em>People want solutions to problems not continued gridlock. The moment of this presidential campaign that hopefully will give Americans and political reporters some relief are the three presidential and one vice presidential debate.</em></blockquote>
<p>Do you agree with his opinion? Do you think the debates will elevate the discourse?</p>
