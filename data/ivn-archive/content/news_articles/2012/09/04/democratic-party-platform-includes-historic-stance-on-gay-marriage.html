<p>The Democratic Party unveiled their <a href="http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 platform</a> this week as they host their national convention in North Carolina. Among a host of topics and political concerns, the Democratic Party platform explicitly supports same-sex marriage. Delegates will vote Tuesday to officially adopt the platform.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform text</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>Freedom to Marry</strong>. We support the right of all families to have equal respect, responsibilities, and protections under the law. We support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for same-sex couples. We also support the freedom of churches and religious entities to decide how to administer marriage as a religious sacrament without government interference.</em>

<em>We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples. We support the full repeal of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.</em></blockquote>
<p>The platform also includes stances on ending the wars abroad, national security, and strengthening the American middle class.</p>
