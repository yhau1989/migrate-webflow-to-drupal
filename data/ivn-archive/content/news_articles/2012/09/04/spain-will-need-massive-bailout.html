<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/nomura-spain-will-need-full-blown-bailout" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spain is nearing financial collapse</a>.&nbsp;Record amounts of money have been withdrawn from banks that already are wobbly at best.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ill-advised scheme to roll up several small insolvent banks into one big insolvent bank, Bankia, was a failure and merely a desperate attempt to buy time.</p>

<p>Nomura says "Spain will need full-blown bailout which will include more active role of ECB in Spanish bond markets" and that using treasury debt to save Bankia pushes Spain towards needing a sovereign bailout.</p>

<p>Spain is much bigger than Greece. A comment on Zero Hedge sums it up</p>
<blockquote>Spain has to get 'fully bailed out' by WHO? Are we STILL pretending someone is standing by with a bunch of free cash to throw around?</blockquote>
