<p>President Obama is expected to give his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention tonight at 10:30pm EST (7:30pm PST). Leading up to his speech, his campaign has invested a substantial amount of time, money, and energy into the social network Twitter.</p>

<p>Following in Mitt Romney's footsteps, Obama's campaign has promoted a hashtag to correspond with today's speech, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23Forward2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Forward2012</a></strong>. Promoted tweets can <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/247955-obama-campaign-promotes-campaign-on-twitter-ahead-of-acceptance-speech-" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> up to $120,000, according to Ad Age, and appear on the left column of Twitter with a purple arrow to indicate the hashtag is promoted. Going into tonight's prime-time coverage, other trending topics include #DNC2012, #FNO, and #VMA, showcasing Obama's competition with both New York Fashion Week and MTV's Video Music Awards.</p>

<p>Up against stiff competition, former president Bill Clinton <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-mediabre885160-20120906,0,2552331.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">edged out</a>&nbsp;the National Football League's season kickoff game on NBC, receiving more TV viewers for yesterday's speech than the game.
