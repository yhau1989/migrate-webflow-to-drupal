<p><em>With a focus on social media blunders, Twitter gaffes, and Facebook faux pas, weâ€™ll be profiling one politician, political figure, organization, or candidate who has committed one of the social media sins in our weekly series Social Slipups.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Last night, President Barack Obama addressed the Democratic National Convention, presenting his case for re-election. He set records, becoming the most "tweeted" political figure on the social network Twitter, driving 52,757 tweets per minute during his speech. The Democratic National Convention as a whole sparked over 9 million tweets with the hashtag <strong>#DNC2012</strong>.</p>

<p>A note to re-tweeters everywhere: Make sure to fully read a tweet before retweeting, because chances are the author of that tweet will see you, find you, and publicly humiliate you.</p>
