<p>There has been much speculation about the importance of the presidential debates, with politicos and voters alike placing increased weight on the debates this election cycle.&nbsp;While all eyes have been on the presidential candidates as the November election nears, Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly and Comedy Central's Jon Stewart plan to take the stage to participate in their own spectacle, debating the merits of Mitt Romney vs. Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Here's the trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Rumble 2012</em>, aka the reason Al Gore invented the Internet:</p>

<p>Not airing on national TV, the debate will be live-streamed online for $4.95 on Saturday, October 6 at 8 p.m. This 90 minute&nbsp;spectacular will take place in the "air-conditioned" confines of the George Washington University auditorium and will be "the&nbsp;first time the ideologically divergent pundits will spar for an extended period of time," <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-bill-o-reilly-jon-stewart-debate-in-washington-20120918,0,6873997.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>Commenting on the event, Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" host Jon Stewart said,&nbsp;"I believe this will be a very enjoyable night for fans of our programs, political junkies, partisans and people who just enjoy yelling.”</p>

<p>Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor" host introduced the debate on his Monday night&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/index.html#/v/1846032217001/oreilly-to-debate-jon-stewart/?playlist_id=86923" rel="noopener noreferrer">show</a>, warning bystanders,&nbsp;“it better be cool in there because Stewart is going to be taking some massive heat.”</p>
