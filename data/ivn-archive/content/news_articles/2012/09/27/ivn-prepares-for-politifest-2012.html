<p>This weekend, IVN will be attending Voice of San Diego's annual <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/politifest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politifest</a>&nbsp;event in San Diego, where community groups and political organizations come together to discuss politics that shape the future of San Diego.</p>

<p>Taking place at&nbsp;Ingram Plaza in Liberty Station, Politifest 2012 will have a beer garden, live music, a kid-friendly zone, and of course, politics.&nbsp;Among the events taking place, there will be a Mayoral debate&nbsp;between the candidates, City Councilman&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/san-diego/tag/carl-demaio/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carl DeMaio</a>&nbsp;and Congressman&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/san-diego/tag/bob-filner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Filner</a>. The San Diego mayoral race is shaping up to be a close race, and Voice of San Diego welcomes its readers to submit questions for the debate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/politifest/debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;Congressional candidate Scott Peters will also take the stage to discuss some of the issues facing San Diego.</p>
