<p>California Gov. Jerry Brown says passage of <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_30,_Sales_and_Income_Tax_Increase_(2012)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 30</a> in November is crucial to help move the state towards a balanced budget. If the proposition passes, estimated new revenue will be $6.8 - $9 billion. This will not be enough to balance the budget and further spending cuts will happen. However, if <a href="http://teachsandiego.com/2012/09/24/the-future-versus-the-austerity-crowd-why-we-must-support-proposition-30/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prop 30</a> does not pass, then devastating spending cuts of $6 billion will almost certainly occur.</p>

<p>"<a href="http://www.thecorsaironline.com/opinion/2012/09/12/say-yes-on-prop-30-vote-for-prop-30-or-face-the-consequences-of-a-6-billion-state-budget-cut/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The state has already cut $56 billion</a> from essential state and local services over the past four years. Students, cops, teachers, firemen simply cannot afford another $6 billion cut projected to take place should Prop 30 fail to pass," says the Santa Monica College student newspaper.</p>

<p><a href="http://teachsandiego.com/2012/09/18/proposition-30-details-quality-of-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 30</a> will raise sales tax to 7.50% from 7.25%, a 0.25% hike, and increase taxes on high earners for seven years. Those with taxable incomes of $250,000 to less than $300,000 will pay 10.3% state income tax, an increase of 9.71%. Taxable incomes of $300,000 to less than $500,000 will have an 11.3% rate, an increase of 17.7%. Those with taxable incomes more than $500,000 will have a 12.3% rate, a substantial increase of 24.39%.</p>

<p>This "millionaire's tax" is problematic not just because the wealthy could decide to move out-of-state but more importantly because it is dependent on their capital gains, which have proven to be highly volatile and difficult to predict.&nbsp;For example, the current California budget assumed $2 billion in revenue from the Facebook IPO, based on a stock price of $42 by now. Instead, Facebook stock is trading at less than half that price. The shortfall in expected revenue will be several hundred million.</p>

<p>"California’s leaders have no one to blame but themselves for pegging the state’s fiscal future to the vagaries of the stock market. The state’s steeply progressive income tax rates – which cause it to spend with abandon during flush times and generate fiscal crises when incomes dip – are driving it toward fiscal ruin,"<a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/aug/30/for-state-budget-nothing-to-like-about-facebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> opines</a> the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>

<p>Polls show that Proposition 30 has a small lead. Yesterday was the biggest day yet for contributions for the Prop 30 campaign, with a <a href="http://www.news10.net/capitol/article/209078/525/Governor-rakes-in-Prop-30-cash" rel="noopener noreferrer">total of $2.8 million</a>, primarily from the California Hospitals Association and the California Teachers Association. Interestingly, a major challenge to Prop 30 <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/2012/08/26/2964990/walters-brown-scares-up-votes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">could come</a> from Molly Munger who is spending millions on her competing tax measure, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_38,_State_Income_Tax_Increase_to_Support_Education_(2012)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prop 38</a>. The conventional wisdom is that having competing tax measures on the same ballot reduces support for both of them.</p>
