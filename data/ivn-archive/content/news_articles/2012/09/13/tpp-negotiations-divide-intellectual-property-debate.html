<p>From <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/01/22/sopa-weighing-arguments-for-online-piracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOPA</a>, PIPA, to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/11/europe-declares-independence-from-america-eu-rejects-acta/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACTA</a> intellectual property issues <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/08/08/aljazeera-documentary-on-sopa-pipa-and-internet-regulation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been a hot topic</a> for discussion this year in American politics. But, the multi-national <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/tpp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trans Pacific Partnership</a>&nbsp;(TPP) negotiations underway right now could have an even bigger impact on intellectual property rights held here in the United States.</p>

<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> round of the TPP negotiations is currently being held in Leesburg, Virginia. A multitude of topics are subject to those negotiations, however, the issue of intellectual property rights has been and remains most controversial. Detailed information, except from some <a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tpp10feb2011ustextiprchapter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">material that has been leaked</a>, is sparse.</p>

<p>Different groups are raising different concerns regarding the TPP, but the information made available is&nbsp; generally limited to commentaries for both advocates of stronger IP laws, and those who opposed increased regulation.</p>

<p>United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk <a href="http://infojustice.org/archives/21137" rel="noopener noreferrer">received a public letter</a> from a group of academics in May, which criticized the negotiations for taking place behind closed doors.&nbsp;Other critics even went so far to call the negotiations a '<a href="http://stopthetrap.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheme</a>' and a&nbsp; '<a href="http://stopthetrap.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">trap</a>'&nbsp;- out of fear that the negotiations could lead to the criminalization and imposition of fines of Internet usage.</p>

<p>Allegedly, TPP negotiators are discussing extending internationally recognized patents to cover things that traditionally were off-limits, such as medicine. The concern is that such patents, if implemented, would prevent accessibility to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/tpp-must-not-trade-away-free-speech-and-health-2012-09-06" rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable medicine</a> and would prevent the distribution of <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/trade-deal-to-curb-generic-drug-use-1.11345" rel="noopener noreferrer">generic drugs</a>.&nbsp;This would also lead to more <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictive</a> intellectual property laws across the globe, for example the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension</a> of copyright terms or the placement of greater liability on Internet intermediaries.&nbsp;The primary concerns seem to be a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/09/aclu-joins-TPP-debate" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat to intellectual property</a>&nbsp;as well as the fear of the prevention of <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/trade-deal-to-curb-generic-drug-use-1.11345" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessible medicines</a>.</p>

<p>However, not everybody sees the TPP as a danger. Proponents argue that privacy and security have to be strengthened to facilitate international trade. An agreement in this area would be advantageous to those participating and promoting economic growth by facilitating cross boarder data transfers. This would <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-holleyman/tpp-the-first-regional-tr_b_1872056.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">encourage entrepreneurship</a> and promote international business.&nbsp;In other words, the economic benefit of <a href="http://blog.copyrightalliance.org/2012/09/highlights-from-tpp-stakeholder-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">robust copyright rules</a> would enable local creators to access a global market place on an even playing field.</p>

<p>What is clear is that there are valid arguments coming from both ends of the intellectual property debate. Only time will tell what the actual result of the negotiations will be and if the agreement will balance the fears that lie at both of these ends.</p>
