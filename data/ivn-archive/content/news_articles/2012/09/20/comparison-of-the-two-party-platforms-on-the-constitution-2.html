<p><img alt="" height="313" src="cloudinary://comparison-of-the-two-party-platforms-on-the-constitution-33314.jpg" title="Constitution" width="600">What do the Democratic and Republican parties think about the Constitution? The table below offers a side-by-side comparison of the two party platforms on the&nbsp;Constitution. Many of the platform positions on constitutional issues will come as no surprise. But there are some less predictable provisions in the platforms.</p>
<p>For instance, the Republican platform’s only mentions of criminal procedure are a couple of proposals to limit investigation methods used by police. The Republican platform no longer calls for the Supreme Court to reverse <em>Miranda</em> and kindred Supreme Court decisions. Attacking the courts as “soft on crime” is no longer part of the platform either.</p>

<p>The Democratic platform’s lack of emphasis on affirmative action, formerly a hot button topic, is also interesting. The Democrats don’t mention affirmative action, and the GOP condemnation of it is a bit muted. That’s particularly interesting because the Supreme Court is set to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/us/justices-to-hear-case-on-affirmative-action-in-higher-education.html?pagewanted=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">hear a case</a> this fall that could well end affirmative action in colleges and universities.</p>

<p>It is no secret that the parties have very different views on social issues, but the contrasts are even starker than one might expect. The Democrats endorse <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, which provided more protection for abortion rights than the current Supreme Court doctrine. The Republicans propose to move significantly in the opposite direction. They put forward a constitutional amendment to give fetuses the same rights that infants currently possess. Technically, that would equate abortion with infanticide and ban it under all circumstances. Similarly, the Democrats affirmatively support same-sex marriage. The Republicans, on the other hand, propose a constitutional amendment to prohibit states from even allowing it.</p>

<p>These are only some of the constitutional issues addressed by the two parties. The table below gives more details and covers a number of other constitutional issues.</p>
