<p>Are iPhone users more likely to vote for Barack Obama? Are Democrats or Republican more likely to splurge on gadgets? With information provided by <a href="http://us.protectyourbubble.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protect Your Bubble</a>, the <a href="http://visual.ly/why-areyoubetteroff-gop-hashtag-failed-us-politics-vs-gadgets" rel="noopener noreferrer">infographic</a> below shows what mobile devices can reveal about political tendencies.</p>

<p>Some key findings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>40% of Obama suporters get their news from Twitter and Facebook, compared to 33% of Romney supporters who use social media to gather news</li>
	<li>46% of people who post their political&nbsp;preferences&nbsp;on social media support Barack Obama, suggesting that&nbsp;Obama supporters are more active on social media</li>
	<li>Smart phone users are more likely to vote for President Obama, with 51% of smart phone users supporting Obama</li>
	<li>Men are more likely to own a smart phone, and lose it, with 68% of men losing their smart phones</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is recognized that Obama succeeds in courting the youth vote, this infographic shows a large gap between youth voters and Mitt Romney.&nbsp;What's more surprising is that amongst the accusations of the Republican-waged "War on Women," the majority of likely Romney voters are women, with 53% of his supporters female versus 49% of Obama voters who are women.</p>
