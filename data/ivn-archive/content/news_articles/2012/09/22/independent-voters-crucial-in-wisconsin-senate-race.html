<p>A&nbsp;new Marquette University Law School <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49090492/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> poll</a>&nbsp;shows Democratic US Representative Tammy Baldwin with a nine percentage point&nbsp;lead over former Governor Tommy Thompson (R) in the US Senate race in Wisconsin. The statewide poll&nbsp;marks a complete turnaround from March, which had Thompson at a nine point advantage.</p>

<p>Baldwin and Thompson are competing for the senate seat left vacant by Democratic Senator Herbert Kohl, who announced his retirement in May. The open-seat race is bound to be one of the most hotly contested in the country, which makes independent voters crucial in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In the wake of Governor Scott Walker's successful attempt to&nbsp;defeat a recall vote, Wisconsin is once again at the center stage of the political arena. Although <a href="http://www.270towin.com/states/Wisconsin" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat-leaning</a> since 1988, the battleground state&nbsp;holds the potential to&nbsp;shift not only the balance of power in the Senate, but the 2012 Presidential Election as well.</p>

<p>The US Senate is currently controlled by a 53-47 Democratic majority. The state's 10 electoral votes are also crucial for Romney in his bid for the White House. A controversial union bill and a Chicago Teachers Union strike in neighboring Illinois may have major implications as to which way independents will sway the state.</p>

<p>"Which state are we?" Thompson was quoted in <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/20/161495807/senate-race-tough-to-call-as-wisconsin-swings" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NPR</a>, "Are we the 14-point Obama state of 2008, in which case I think on the Senate side Baldwin is very competitive? Or are we the strong Walker state of 2010 and in the recall this year, in which case it's a much stronger position for Republicans?"</p>

<p>That seems to be the million dollar question as the pendulum continues to swing wildly&nbsp;between both sides. In a <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar poll</a>, independents now support Baldwin over Thompson by a 50-38 margin. In August, they favored Thompson 47-37. On a national level, independents now favor President Barack Obama 53-38, up from the 45-43 margin in August. The ability to harness that momentum&nbsp;seems dependent&nbsp;on which party is better able to gain independent support at any given time.</p>

<p>As of late, Obama holds <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leads</a> in key battleground states: Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. It will be critical for both the president and Baldwin to retain the independent vote in November if they want to be reelected.</p>
