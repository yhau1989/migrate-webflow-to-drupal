<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ivn-us-logo-gordita-supreme-resized.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="200" src="cloudinary://ivn-us-logo-gordita-supreme-resized.jpg" width="300"></a>On Thursday April 19th, the University of San Diego School of Law Independent Voter Club, the Independent Voter Project, and congressional and mayoral candidates will come together for a forum on the importance of independent voters in 2012 elections. It will be the largest gathering of independent candidates in California so far in 2012 election cycle.</p>

<p>Independent congressional candidates speaking at the event include <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/chad-condit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad Condit</a> (CD-10), Supervisor <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/linda-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Parks</a> (CD-26), and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jack-doyle/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Doyle</a> (CD-52). Two San Diego mayoral candidates will join them, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat</a> <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bob-filner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rep. Bob Filner</a> and Independent Assemblyman <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/nathan-fletcher/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nathan Fletcher</a>.</p>

<p>June 5th marks California's first nonpartisan primary election under <a href="http://endpartisanship.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 14</a>. The new procedures, commonly known as an "open primary", will allow voters to support candidates regardless of party affiliation. Thursday's press conference will highlight the importance of independent voters and the impact of credible independent candidates in the upcoming June primary and November general election.</p>

<p>The event at USD will include a press conference, speeches and candidate Q&amp;A's.</p>

<p>In addition to Condit, Parks, Doyle, Filner and Fletcher, highly respected Republican-turned-Independent political campaign consultant George Gorton will also be in attendance.</p>

<p>A record high 40% of Americans identify themselves as independents, a section of the electorate forecast to make a historic difference in this election cycle. There are 3.8 million "No Party Preference" voters in California alone, an increase of 1.3 million since 2000.</p>

<p>The forum welcomes people of all ages and political affiliations. An open taco cart will be available for the enjoyment of all attendees.</p>

<p>Scheduled speeches begin at 5pm, at the Plaza de San Diego on USD's campus. Representatives from USD's Independent Voter Club and Law Democrats will be in attendance, along with the Independent Voter Project.</p>

<p>IVN has been covering closely the emergence of viable independent candidates statewide in <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a>. Learn more about the event's featured independent speakers here at Independent Voter Network:</p>
