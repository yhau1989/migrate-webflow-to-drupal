<p>With former&nbsp;Pennsylvania&nbsp;Senator <strong>Rick&nbsp;Santorum</strong>&nbsp;out of the primary, the dynamics of the presidential race have changed, with increased attention on the&nbsp;likelihood&nbsp;of a general election battle between Republican <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitt Romney</a> and Democrat <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barack Obama</a>. In response, both campaigns have shifted into general election mode.</p>

<p>Monday, President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> launched an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/president-obama-mitt-romney-drop-war-women-transparency/story?id=16151271#.T42wB5pWrEU" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack on Romney over&nbsp;transparency</a>,</p>
<blockquote><em>Calling on Romney to release his tax returns going back several years; disclose the top money "bundlers" to his campaign; detail his overseas investments; explain the deleted emails and missing hard drives from his time as governor of Massachusetts; and, thanks to reporters eavesdropping on a private fundraising event on Sunday, elaborate on why he told top donors that as president he would consider cutting federal agencies for education and housing.</em></blockquote>
<p>Former Massachusetts Governor <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>, however, has his own plan of attack, and has begun attacking the President on issues ranging from healthcare, jobs, gas prices, and constitutional protections. At a Wisconsin rally on Friday, Romney faulted Obama for economic woes by claiming, <em>"In Barack Obama’s government-centered society, the government must do more because the economy is doomed to do less. When you attack business and vilify success, you will have less business and less success."&nbsp;</em>Speaking at the annual NRA meeting in St. Louis, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/327983/20120413/obama-gun-control-guns-second-amendment-nra.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>:&nbsp;<em>"We need a president who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not; I will."</em></p>

<p>And while the media has positioned Mitt Romney against Barack Obama as the general election competitors, <strong>Ron Paul</strong> is still a prominent force in the Republican Primary, unlikely to win the nomination, but determined to promote his ideology. Last weekend, he managed to pick up delegates in three congressional districts, adding <a href="http://www.piercecountyherald.com/event/article/id/44552/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 more delegates </a>to his delegate count. Despite trailing Mitt Romney and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/newt-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newt Gingrich</a>, his campaign is still<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2012/0411/Buffett-rule-Five-questions-about-Obama-s-plan-answered/Do-the-rich-pay-a-fair-tax-rate" rel="noopener noreferrer"> targeting the youth</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>He’s long said that he wants to build a political movement as much as anything else, and if you look at his upcoming events, they remain heavy on appearances at colleges, which remain his most fertile ground for winning converts.</em></blockquote>
<p>This week, he has scheduled events at the University of Rhode Island, Cornell, and University of Pittsburgh, capitalizing on his popularity among constituents&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0416/Why-Ron-Paul-is-still-in-the-presidential-race" rel="noopener noreferrer">aged 18-34</a>.</p>

<p>But where is former House Speaker&nbsp;<strong>Newt Gingrich</strong>? Trying to dig himself out of a $4.5 million hole, he has resorted to desperate measures to keep his campaign alive. At the end of March, it was reported that Gingrich was charging supporters $50 for a photo with him, and now, in a risky move, has resorted to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75095.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">renting his donor list</a> for as much as $26,000. Despite these measures, Newt Gingrich's campaign continues to&nbsp;plummet, partly due to his <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75095.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">refusal</a> to downgrade from private jets.</p>

<p>Do you think Newt Gingrich's debt will force him out of the race?</p>
