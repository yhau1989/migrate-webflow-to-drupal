<p>As a result of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ER-6Minutes" rel="noopener noreferrer">viral video</a> on electoral reform out of my briefing to the Occupy NYC working group on electoral reform, a number of stakeholders got in touch with me.&nbsp; Others I have identified via searches for major civil society elements with defined electoral reform programs.</p>

<p>Below are the ones I have identified.&nbsp; They can also be seen, with their logos, at <a href="http://bigbatusa.org/electoral-reform/strategy-tactics-activist-elements/e-other-reference-points/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directory of Activist Individuals &amp; Organizations (USA)</a>.&nbsp; I welcome nominations for others to be added to this list, and I must say up front, that while some of these were quick to give me their inputs for the Act itself, all of them, without exception, have failed to respond to my letters seeking their assistance in moving toward a Statement of Demand being read publicly soon, ideally on President's Day.</p>
