<p>A year ago, we <a href="http://ivn.us/2011/04/30/state-departments-new-excessive-passport-application-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on the State Department's new passport application rules, which some have called unconstitutional. A new bill now making its way through Congress could prevent even more Americans from traveling abroad. A transportation bill recently passed by the Senate contains a controversial provision that could allow the State Department to revoke the passport of anyone with an “excessive” tax debt.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid added the tax enforcement language to an “Act to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs”, probably categorizing it under the latter part of the title, “and for other purposes”. That bill -- <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1813/text" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB1813</a>-- was introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in November. Before it was passed by the Senate on a 74-22 vote in March, it became the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;FileStore_id=6d1e2690-6bc7-4e13-9169-0e7bc2ca0098" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAP-21</a>.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="http://finance.senate.gov/legislation/download/?id=413001ef-d5eb-4e1b-85a3-615ae55d5bf4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summary of the Senate Finance Committee Title to the Highway Bill</a> on the Senate's website reads:<em></em></p>
<blockquote><em>Currently the Federal government revokes passports and denies new passports to individuals who owe more than $2,500 in child support payments. Similarly, this provision would authorize the government to deny the application for a new passport or renewal of an existing passport when the individual has $50,000 or more (indexed for inflation) of unpaid federal taxes which the IRS is collecting through enforcement action. It would also permit the Federal government to revoke a passport upon reentry into the United States for such individuals. This provision is estimated to raise $743 million over ten years.</em></blockquote>
<p>The provision isn't as draconian as a first glance would have you believe, but it would be precedent setting, says tax attorney Robert Wood.</p>

“Does this [enforcement] apply in all cases? Mercifully no,” writes Wood in a recent <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/04/07/forget-travel-if-you-owe-the-irs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes piece</a>. “You could travel if your tax debt is being paid in a timely manner or in emergency circumstances or for humanitarian reasons. But this isn’t limited to criminal tax cases or situations where the government fears someone is fleeing a tax debt.”</p>

<p>Wood reminds his readers that the IRS files liens and levies all the time and that under the tax enforcement provision of MAP-21, all it would take is an accusation of a debt to prevent any U.S. Citizen from leaving the country at their leisure.</p>

<p>According to constitutional attorney Angel Reyes, the provision is a violation of due process and is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>“It takes away your right to enter or exit the country based upon a non-judicial IRS determination that you owe taxes,” Reyes told <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2012/04/05/owe-irs-youre-not-going-anywhere/#ixzz1rdyj4o00" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOX Business</a>. “It’s a scary thought that our congressional representatives want to give the IRS the power to detain US citizens over taxes, which could very well be in dispute.”</p>

<p>Perhaps <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a> presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ron-paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Paul</a> wasn't off his meds when he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DzLnB6L_EkU" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> last September that the lingering economic malaise might encourage federal-level <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_control" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital controls</a> (and even lead to what he called “people controls”). Those remarks, the target of popular ridicule at the time, came during a nationally televised Republican presidential debate.</p>
