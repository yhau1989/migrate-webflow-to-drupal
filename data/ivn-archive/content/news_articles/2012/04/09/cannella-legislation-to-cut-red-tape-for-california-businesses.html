<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO, CA – New legislation by Senator Anthony Cannella (R-Ceres) would establish a “one-stop-shop” internet website for individuals to use as a tool in obtaining the necessary permits and licenses to start a business. The bill, <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1327&amp;search_keywords=" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="SB 1327">SB 1327</a>, is designed to help individuals wanting to start a new business to navigate California’s complex regulatory system by streamlining the application process.</p>

<p>“As a small business owner, I have firsthand knowledge of how confusing and time-consuming it is to work through our state bureaucracy. My main focus this year is job creation, and we must do more to make it easier for businesses to operate and expand,” said Senator Cannella. “Especially during this tough economy, state bureaucracy should not be a burden on small businesses that do not have the resources needed to navigate California’s complex permitting and licensing system.”</p>

<p>In recent years, many different surveys and organizations have named California’s business climate as one of the worst in the nation due to issues such as high regulatory costs and high levels of state and local government debt. These problems all negatively affect the economy but perhaps those hardest hit are small businesses. There are approximately 3.4 million small businesses in California, representing 99.2% of the state’s employers and 52.1% of California’s private-sector employment.</p>

<p>“The one thing we hear time and time again from our members is how difficult it is to navigate state government. We support Senator Cannella’s efforts to create a one-stop shop and cut red tape,” said John Kabateck, the Executive Director of the National Federation of Independent Business/California. “Other states are doing this and it would make it easier on California’s job creators to build their business.”</p>

<p>SB 1327 will be heard in front of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee on April 10, 2012.</p>
