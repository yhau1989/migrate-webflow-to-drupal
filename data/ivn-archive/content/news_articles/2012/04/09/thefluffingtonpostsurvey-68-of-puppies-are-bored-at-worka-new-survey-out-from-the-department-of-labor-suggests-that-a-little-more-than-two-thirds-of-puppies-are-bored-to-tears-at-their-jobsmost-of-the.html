<p><strong>SURVEY: 68% of Puppies Are Bored at Work</strong></p>
<p>A new survey out from the Department of Labor suggests that a little more than two-thirds of puppies are bored to tears at their jobs.</p>
<p>“Most of the puppies surveyed felt they were underemployed or mis-employed,” says Ronald Wills, a DoL spokesperson. “Puppies are just better at guarding things or digging. They’re not going to be that excited about spreadsheets.”</p>
