<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO – North State Assemblyman and Chief Republican Whip Dan Logue announced that his bill to help veterans with prior medical training get fast tracked into healthcare professions passed unanimously out of the Assembly Veterans Affairs Committee yesterday. AB 1976 is sponsored by the California State Rural Health Association and has received support from a broad array of veterans groups and professional associations.</p>

<p>“Seeing this bill pass unanimously through its second committee is very exciting,” Logue said. “Many veterans come from rural areas of California, and the object of this bill is to fast track those who already have medical training from the military into civilian healthcare jobs.”</p>

<p>AB 1976 would break down barriers facing returning veterans, by requiring state entities that license healthcare professionals to establish policies that recognize the education, training, and practical experience of a veteran applicant. It would also require these entities to work with the college programs they accredit to ensure that the colleges have procedures in place so that veteran applicants are not forced to retake classes they have already completed at a military institute, and so that veterans are able to quickly complete the additional coursework necessary for licensure.</p>

<p>“Rural areas will benefit when their homecoming veterans get the recognition they deserve and receive credit for their prior education,” Logue added, “A large group of stakeholders is working with us to ensure that licensing boards and colleges develop procedures to make this happen.”</p>

<p>AB 1976 will next be heard before the Assembly Appropriations Committee.</p>

<p>Assemblyman Logue represents the 3rd Assembly District in the California Legislature, which includes the communities of Butte, Lassen, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sierra and Yuba.</p>
