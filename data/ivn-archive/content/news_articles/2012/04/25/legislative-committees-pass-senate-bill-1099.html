<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>

<p>Sacramento, CA., April 25, 2012 — The National Federation of Independent Business/California applauds members of the Senate Governmental Organization and Environmental Quality Committees for their support of SB 1099 (Wright), which would require all non-urgency regulations to go into effect at pre-established quarterly dates per year.</p>

<p>According to the Office of Administrative Law, last year 103 different state entities implemented 491 new regulations, all at different dates and timelines throughout the calendar year. Small business owners, focused on running their businesses, do not have the administrative or legal infrastructures afforded to many larger businesses and are unable to keep up with the ever-changing and new regulations that are imposed upon them at different times throughout the year.</p>
<p>“NFIB and small business owners throughout California are grateful to the members of the Senate Governmental Organization and Environmental Quality Committees for their leadership and support,” said John Kabateck, NFIB/CA executive director.&nbsp; “In turn, we hope that their colleagues in the Legislature and the Governor will follow suit by giving small businesses hope and certainty in the regulatory process.”</p>

<p>SB 1099 neither promotes nor prevents state regulations, but it would give already struggling "mom and pop" businesses and all job creators a level of predictability and sufficient time to prepare for any such regulations so that they are, in fact, compliant and also able to keep their small businesses working and growing in our communities. According to recent NFIB polling, small businesses pay 37% more than larger businesses to comply with regulations and spend nearly $2,000 per week to comply with various regulatory and permitting paperwork requirements.</p>
