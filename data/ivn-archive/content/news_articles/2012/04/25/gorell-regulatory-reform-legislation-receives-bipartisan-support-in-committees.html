<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO – Assembly Bills 1982 and 2117 authored by Assembly Member Jeff Gorell (R-Camarillo) successfully cleared major hurdles today as they received bipartisan approval from their respective policy committees.</p>

<p>AB 1982 which deals with legislative review of the most expensive state regulations was approved by Assembly Business, Professions and Consumer Protection, while AB 2117 which addresses problems with state regulation of storm water runoff was passed out of Environmental Safety.</p>

<p>“As California struggles to recover from economic recession, we need to send a message to job creators encouraging them to invest in our state,” stated Gorell. “Our elected legislators must be responsible for creating a business environment that provides needed jobs.”</p>

<p>The California Chamber of Commerce has hailed AB 1982 as a “Job Creator” bill, and has offered their public support.&nbsp; Support for AB 2117 has come from dozens of cities throughout the state, hospitals, college campuses, military bases and businesses that are concerned with the tremendous costs of complying with the state board’s storm water regulations.</p>

<p>AB 1982 provides accountability and responsibility for regulations that are enacted by state agencies and departments by requiring all major regulations (costing $50 million or more) to be sent to the Legislature for review and approval.</p>

<p>AB 2117 addresses overreaching State Water Quality Control Board regulations and requires that the board work with the U.S. EPA to develop a comprehensive statewide plan that identifies cost effective measures and activities, reviews best practices, and expands the state’s approach by utilizing the appropriate departments and agencies to achieve the goals of the Federal Clean Water Act, while minimizing the burden on taxpayers.&nbsp; Upon completion of the study, the Legislature will conform the best practices identified in the comprehensive roadmap to the current storm water regulations that affect local cities, hospitals, university campuses, and a broad spectrum of businesses across the state.</p>
