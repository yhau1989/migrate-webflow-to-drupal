<p><strong>Good Friday?</strong></p>

<p>On Friday, the Obama administration's March employment figures will be released. Last month's report was largely positive. February saw the economy add <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/story/2012-03-09/February-employment-report/53431934/1" rel="noopener noreferrer">227,000 jobs</a>. The "solid" showing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/february-jobs-report-lets-call-it-a-recovery/2012/03/09/gIQADJ8B1R_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">continued gains</a> from January (284,000) and December (223,000).</p>

<p>Predictions for the employment report are quite varied. <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-job-growth-seen-tapering-off-slightly-2012-04-01?reflink=MW_news_stmp" rel="noopener noreferrer">MarketWatch</a> sees job growth slowing in March. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-01/employment-probably-kept-growing-in-march-u-s-economy-preview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> expects a fourth consecutive month of over 200,000 added workers.</p>

<p>In addition to Friday's jobs report, car sales are scheduled for a Tuesday release. Soaring gas prices have dominated headlines but haven't kept <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/30/usa-economy-idUSL2E8EU2VI20120330" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer spending</a> from increasing. Large Chinese factories saw an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/01/us-china-economy-pmi-idUSBRE83001420120401" rel="noopener noreferrer">11-month high</a> in activity in March, however the broader economic outlook for the world's second-largest economy was not as simple.</p>

<p><strong>GOP Primary</strong></p>

<p>Republicans continue on this week with their primary process, with primaries on Wednesday April 3rd in Maryland, Washington DC and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Gov. Mitt Romney leads polling in Wisconsin by large margins. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_republican_presidential_primary-1601.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a> average for top polls puts <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gov. Romney</a> at 40%, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rick-santorum/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Santorum</a> at 32.5%, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ron-paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Ron Paul</a> at 9.3%, and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/newt-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaker Gingrich</a> at 6%. Numbers in Maryland are similar, with Gov. Romney polling ahead.</p>

<p>Positive polling numbers are backed up by a convenient group of endorsements made throughout last week. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Rep. Paul Ryan, former Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, and President George H. W. Bush, all endorsed Gov. Romney publicly.</p>

<p>Despite it all, Sen. Santorum said on Sunday's Meet The Press, he would not halt his campaign until Gov. Romney wins the 1,144 delegates required.</p>

<p>Dr. Ron Paul will visit California this week for a series of campaign events and private fundraisers. Dr. Paul will visit Cal State Chico on Tuesday, UCLA on Wednesday and UC Berkeley on Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>World</strong></p>

<p>Opposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/01/world/asia/myanmar-elections/?hpt=hp_t1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> and her political party, National League for Democracy, won a seat on Myanmar's parliament on Sunday.</p>

<p>Internal political issues have fueled internet <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/04/01/internet-coup-rumors-spark-response-in-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer">coup rumors in China</a>, resulting in arrests and a web crackdown. For their May 2012 issue, Vanity Fair examines in <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/internet-regulation-war-sopa-pipa-defcon-hacking" rel="noopener noreferrer">World War 3.0</a>, who should control the internet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21551530" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economist reports</a> Peter Cruddas, who served as Britain's Conservative Party's treasurer, told journalists posing as lobbyists that their donation money could secure access to top government figures, including Prime Minister David Cameron, and influence policy.</p>
