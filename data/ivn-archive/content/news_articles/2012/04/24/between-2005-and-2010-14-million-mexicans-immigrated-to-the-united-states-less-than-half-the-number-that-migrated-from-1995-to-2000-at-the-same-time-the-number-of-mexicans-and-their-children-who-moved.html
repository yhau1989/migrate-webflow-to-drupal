<p><span>Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4-million Mexicans immigrated to the United States, less than half the number that migrated from 1995 to 2000. At the same time, the number of Mexicans and their children who moved to Mexico in the same five-year period rose to 1.4 million, about double the number that did so from 1995 to 2000. -<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/mexican-immigration-to-us-stalls-heated-debate-over-cause.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a></span></p>
