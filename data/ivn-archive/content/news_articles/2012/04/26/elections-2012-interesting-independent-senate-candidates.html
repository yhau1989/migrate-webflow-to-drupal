<p>The current approval rate for Congress hovers at an all-time low and the political makeup of the Senate chamber is a critically important aspect to this year's election cycle. Dissatisfaction over the performance of incumbents currently serving will place significant attention on the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/indepedents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">independents</a> vying for their seats. Here is a brief introduction to a handful of independent candidates&nbsp;running for Senate seats across the country in 2012.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="158" src="cloudinary://jon-barrie.jpg" width="115"></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.jonbarrieforsenate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Ross Barrie</a>-</strong><em>“I am NOT a politician and I have never been one. In fact, I am entering the political arena as an 'unknown' seeking solutions to our country.” </em></p>

<p><em></em>Running for U.S. Senate in <strong>New&nbsp;Mexico</strong>, Barrie considers himself to be a constitutional conservative. If elected, he will donate half of his congressional salary to children with disabilities in New Mexico, and will not participate in the congressional healthcare and retirement systems.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.iangilyeat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Gilyeat</a>-</strong> <em>“The desire to steal illegally into the country will disappear if we simplify, shorten and lower the cost of entry.”</em></p>

<p>Running for U.S. Senate in <strong>Arizona</strong> against Senator John McCain, Gilyeat is an independent for limited government and protection of the free market. In a state that has been under scrutiny for strict immigration practices, Gilyeat proposes to streamline the immigration process. He also is in favor of repealing the 17th amendment, which established direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote.</p>

<p>Cimbrelo is a candidate for U.S. Senate in <strong>Massachusetts</strong>. He describes himself as a fiscally conservative social liberal. He stands for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as achieving energy independence in the U.S.</p>

If we are to once again enjoy control over our government, we must do more than vote: we must take an active part in the political process.”</em></p>

<p>Rupert is an independent candidate running for U.S. Senate in <strong>Ohio</strong>. As a constitutional conservative Rupert stands for state sovereignty and limited federal government.</p>

<p><strong>Lawrence Donahue<em>-</em></strong><em>“Serving as a member of the United States Congress is a full time job as is running for President. Senators and Members of the House of Representatives cannot effectively represent their constituents while they are traveling throughout the country campaigning for President.”</em></p>

<p>Running for U.S. Senate in <strong>New Jersey</strong>, Donahue<strong> </strong>believes that members of the U.S. Congress should resign from their positions if they decide to run for President. He also supports four year terms for Congress.</p>

<p><strong>Jack Edward Rooney-</strong> <em>“Many Americans I talk to from both parties feel the nation has lost its way. Since the major political parties have been the chief architects in charge during this great American train wreck, it is reasonable to conclude they can never place us back on the right track.” </em></p>

<p>Running for U.S. Senate in <strong>Indiana</strong>, Rooney is advocate against the two-party system in America. He recently spoke about the two-party system in a new documentary entitled <em><a href="http://www.jackrooney.net/TwoPartyAmerica.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-Party America</a></em>.</p>

<p>Angus King is a former two-term governor of Maine, where he focused on economic development and job creation.

<p>Each of these candidates stress one common theme: the two parties are no longer working for Americans. They all say that they want to work independently of the parties and vote based upon their personal beliefs not because of party pressure. Will these candidates, and others like them, be able to capitalize on the widespread discontent in America and get their electorates to cast their votes for nonpartisan alternatives?</p>
