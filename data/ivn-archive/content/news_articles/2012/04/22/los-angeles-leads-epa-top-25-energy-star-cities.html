<p>Los Angeles topped the Environmental Protection Agency Top 25 Cities with "Energy Star" Certified Buildings for the fourth year in a row in 2011. The City of Angels increased its number of "Energy Star" certified buildings by 149 from 2010, leading the United States with 659 buildings.</p>

<p>In all, six California cities made the list, including San Francisco (#5), Riverside (#9), Sacramento (#12), San Diego (#19) and San Jose (#21).</p>

<p>Washington, DC ranked second on the list with 404 "Energy Star" certified buildings. San Francisco fell from third to fifth between 2010 and 2011. Riverside, California made it's first appearance in the top 10 with 164 green "Energy Star" certified buildings.</p>

<p>"More and more organizations are discovering the value of Energy Star as they work to cut costs and reduce their energy use," said EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, in a statement. "This year marked the twentieth anniversary of the Energy Star program, and today Energy Star certified buildings in cities across America are helping to strengthen local economies and protect the planet for decades to come."</p>
