<p><strong>The Youth&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Barack Obama will spend <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/20/president-obama-travel-north-carolina-colorado-and-iowa-calling-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer">next week</a>&nbsp;focusing on the constituency that carried him to the White House back in 2008: the youth. With scheduled stops in&nbsp;North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa, Obama plans to visit college towns in these three swing states to discuss the issue of student loans.</p>

<p>To coincide with his campaign stops, a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/20/president-obama-travel-north-carolina-colorado-and-iowa-calling-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> from the White House reveals that the Obama Administration will launch a social media campaign centered around Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ to address the increase in student loan interest rates, using the hashtag&nbsp;#DontDoubleMyRate.</p>

<p><strong>GOP Primary&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After a three week&nbsp;hiatus, the GOP Primary will resume this Tuesday with voters returning to the polls for five primaries. For a total of 231 delegates,&nbsp;Connecticut,&nbsp;Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island will cast their vote for their Republican presidential pick.</p>

<p>With 95 delegates, New York's primary will be closely watched, and while Romney takes a commanding lead in the polls, the distribution of delegates is all but finalized. While the 34 at-large Republican delegates will be awarded to the candidate who receives the majority of votes, the remainder will be distributed by district, with two delegates awarded to the winner of each of New York's 29 congressional districts.</p>

<p>And while Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich remain in the race, the media and polls have already shifted the tone of the election to a battle between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, downplaying the importance of Tuesday's elections.</p>

<p><strong>The Bankruptcy World&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Monday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/radlax-gateway-hotel-llc-v-amalgamated-bank/" rel="noopener noreferrer">RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank</a>, addressing the issue of corporate bankruptcy.&nbsp;At question is the right of a secured lender to trade debt for the assets of a troubled company under Chapter 11.&nbsp;The decision will effect corporations and unions alike and is becoming an increasingly important issue because according to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120420-709061.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</a>, "many companies are turning to Chapter 11 as a means to sell their assets to their highest bidder rather than as a reorganization opportunity."</p>
