<p>The United States has experienced profound demographic, economic and social changes, most apparently when examining the Census data from 1940 to the last national Census in 2010. Population has exploded, diversity and education levels have changed and living conditions are much different. Take a look for yourself at the ways America has changed since 1940. Does any of the figures surprise you? Did you expect anything to turn out different? How has America changed most significantly in your lifetime?</p>
