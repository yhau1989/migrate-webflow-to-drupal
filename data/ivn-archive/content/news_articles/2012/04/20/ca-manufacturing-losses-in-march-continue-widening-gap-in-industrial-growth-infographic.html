<p>California lost another 2,200 manufacturing jobs in March, according to today's Labor Market Information Department (LMID) <a href="http://www.cmta.net/redirect.php?redirect=http://www.edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/pdf/urate201204.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="report">report</a>. After a 33 percent loss of the state's industrial base over the last decade, the larger concern is an emerging trend in the country's manufacturing growth numbers. Over the last two years, California has increasingly lagged the U.S. in terms of new industrial jobs.</p>
<p>Since 2010 the U.S. grew it's manufacturing employment by 4 percent and a total of 470,000 jobs, while California remains stagnant with only .03 percent growth.</p>
