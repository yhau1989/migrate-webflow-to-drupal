<p><em>Human Activity Has Increased Greenhouse Gases in the Atmosphere </em></p>
<p>• Heat-trapping greenhouse gases are now at record-high levels in the atmosphere compared to the recent and distant past.</p>
<p>• These high atmospheric levels are the clear result of human activity.</p>
<p>• Average global carbon dioxide concentrations have increased about 38 percent from pre-industrial levels to 2009, and almost all of this is due to human emissions.</p>
<p>• Atmospheric concentrations of the two most important, directly emitted, long-lived greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide and methane—are well above the natural range over at least the last 650,000 years.</p>
<p>• Projected atmospheric concentrations of the six greenhouse gases show an increase under all scenarios by 2030 compared to 2000.</p>
<p><em>The Climate is Warming </em></p>
<p>• Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in:</p>
<p>o Global average air and ocean temperatures</p>
<p>o Widespread melting of snow and ice</p>
<p>o Rising global average sea level</p>
<p>• Global surface temperatures have risen by 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 100 years.</p>
<p>• Eight of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.</p>
