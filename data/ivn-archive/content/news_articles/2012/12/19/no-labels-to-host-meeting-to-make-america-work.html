<p>On January 14, 2013, the nonpartisan grassroots movement, No Labels, is hosting a conference in New York City called the <a href="http://meetforamerica.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meeting to Make America Work</a>. The purpose of the event is to bring together thousands of citizens, influential voices, and elected officials from across the United States to discuss solutions to the biggest problems facing the nation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nolabels.org/whoweare" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Labels</a> is committed to the proposition that our elected officials need to look past the “old politics of point-scoring” and toward practical solutions to solve the problems the US faces on a daily basis. It is not just a movement composed of independent voters, but Republicans and Democrats as well who share a common belief that Washington needs to reject politics as usual.</p>

<p>From the No Labels website:</p>
<blockquote><em>In Washington, D.C., the most powerful interest groups work to push our leaders and our political parties apart. They demand rigid commitment to far left or far right ideology, and they ruthlessly punish leaders who step out of line. No Labels is different. We are the only grassroots organization in Washington, and indeed in America, that is mobilizing citizens to push our leaders to work together.</em></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this year, No Labels launched <a href="http://www.nolabels.org/work" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Make Congress Work</em></a>, its first organized grassroots campaign. It is founded on twelve proposals; including <em>No Budget, No Pay</em>, <em>Fix the Filibuster</em>, <em>Make Members Come to Work</em>, <em>No Pledge but the Oath of Office</em>, and other reforms that don’t favor one party or cause over another and seek to end legislative gridlock.</p>

<p>To date, more than ninety members of Congress have co-sponsored efforts to push the <em>No Budget, No Pay</em> proposal. Many of the proposals from the <em>Make Congress Work</em> campaign have gained traction across the country and President Barack Obama has voiced his support for a reform that would require an up-or-down vote on presidential appointees.</p>

<p>The Meeting to Make America Work is meant to be a culmination of the efforts made so far by No Labels. The event will feature members of Congress that have joined the movement’s “problem-solver” caucus, as well as the introduction of two nationally recognized leaders from both mainstream political parties who will lead No Labels forward.</p>

<p>No Labels will also a host a Citizen’s Training to educate people on how they can make a difference and help fix the nation’s problems. Registration for the event is currently open.</p>
