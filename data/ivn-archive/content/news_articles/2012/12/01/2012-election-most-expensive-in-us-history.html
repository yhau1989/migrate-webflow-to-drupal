<p>The 2012 election has been the most expensive election in the US history, costing more than <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/total-cost-of-election-could-be-6-billion/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 billion</a>, $2.6 billion on the presidential election alone.</p>

<p>This number is so high that it is difficult to understand what it all went to. The following infographic, created by the <a href="http://efinancialresourcecenter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">eFinancial&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Center</a>, helps understand the costs of this election by comparing how much a vote for each candidates <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/17/election-highlights-need-for-campaign-finance-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a>, as well as compares between the costs of this election and past historic elections.</p>
