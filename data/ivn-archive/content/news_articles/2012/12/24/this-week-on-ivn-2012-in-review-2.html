<h3>The Year 2012 in Review<em>
</em></h3>
With 2012 coming to an end, time has come to evaluate the year we just lived.&nbsp;On the surface, not much changed in 2012 with respect to the partisan political culture that dominates the broad public dialogue. But what can't be found on the score sheets of the number crunching political consultants, or within a two-sided talk shows, are the positive societal changes that are always the leading indicator of political progress.

California had its first&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/openprimaries/2012/11/28/open-primary-credited-with-election-of-underdog-assemblyman/" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-partisan primary</a>, which saw more competitive races, more incumbents lose, and more underdogs take-on the party establishment. Women made big strides, gaining more seats than at any other time in our history. And we have shown once more that in the face of national tragedies, despite our differences, we can roll up our sleeves and work together.

Join us this week on IVN as we review the highlights from 2012.

Florida was the last state to be called, due in part to long lines at some polling locations and absentee ballots that needed. IVN was the first to call the state for the President.
