<p>With the surprise <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/12/06/jim-demint-announces-resignation-joins-heritage-foundation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">resignation</a> of South Carolina US Senator Jim DeMint this week, there is high anticipation to see who Republican governor Nikki Haley will appoint to the vacant seat until 2014 when a special election will be held. While many people believe the front-runner is US Representative Tim Scott, there are a number of other names that may be considered for the appointment.</p>
<h6>Tim Scott (US Representative, 1st District)</h6>
<p>US Rep Tim Scott emerges as the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/12/06/tim_scott_jim_demint_south_carolina_house_member_seen_as_likely_successor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">likely</a> favorite to&nbsp;fill DeMint's seat and he is <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/12/07/3712112/rep-tim-scott-is-leading-contender.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored</a> to be DeMint's&nbsp;top choice for the job.</p>

<p>Not a tea party Republican per se, Scott did receive endorsements from Tea Party groups when he&nbsp;first ran for the US House in 2010. He is also seen as&nbsp;an appropriate ideological successor to DeMint.</p>

<p>As an African-American, Scott would immediately heighten the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/tim-scotts-bio-raises-senate-appeal-84719.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversity</a> of a party currently&nbsp;revising how it can better appeal to minorities.</p>
<h6>Joe Wilson (US Representative, 2nd District)</h6>
<p>Perhaps still best known for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/10/obama.heckled.speech/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">shouting</a> "You lie!" at President Obama during a joint session of Congress, Wilson has served South Carolina in the US House since 2001. Wilson serves in a safe Republican district and regularly wins re-election with 60 percent of the vote or more.</p>
<h6>Jeff Duncan (US Representative, 3rd District)</h6>
<p>First elected to the US House in 2010, Duncan is a fiscal conservative and <a href="http://www.fitsnews.com/2012/01/02/sc-freshmen-soar-on-freedom-index/" rel="noopener noreferrer">scored</a> a 100% rating from the <em>New American</em>'s Freedom Index for his "adherence to constitutional principles of limited government, fiscal responsibility, national sovereignty, and a traditional foreign policy&nbsp;of avoiding entanglements."</p>

<p>Duncan is also one of many Republicans adamant in his opposition to UN ambassador Susan Rice's potential elevation to secretary of state, describing her as "<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/84218.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tainted</a>" regarding her talking&nbsp;points about the attacks on the US consulate&nbsp;in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.</p>
<h6>Trey Gowdy (US Representative, 4th District)</h6>
<p>Before he was elected to the US House in 2010, Gowdy was a state attorney and a&nbsp;solicitor general. As a congressman, Gowdy has positioned himself as a strong conservative and has been obstinate in his opposition to the HHS <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6RFylFMSHo" rel="noopener noreferrer">mandate</a>, the Obama administration's position in the Fast and Furious <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lIWMghw9Yg" rel="noopener noreferrer">scandal</a>, and UN ambassador Susan Rice on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Za4KXo5Ao" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benghazi</a>.</p>
<h6>Mick Mulvaney (US Representative, 5th District)</h6>
<p>Elected to the US House in 2010 after a pair of terms in the South Carolina legislature, Mulvaney serves on the Financial Services Committee and was one of the <a href="http://mulvaney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=104&amp;Itemid=313" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaders</a> of the "Cut, Cap, and Balance"&nbsp;option to avoid the fiscal cliff in the summer of 2011 that was rejected.</p>
<h6>Tom Davis (South Carolina State Senator, 46th District)</h6>
<p>Davis is a unique choice to fill DeMint's seat because he already has <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/264824/if-tom-davis-could-be-convinced-to-run-against-lindsey-graham-how-many-would-pledge-to-donate-today" rel="noopener noreferrer">grassroots</a> support to run for the US Senate in 2014 - against Lindsey Graham.</p>

<p>A wrinkle&nbsp;of this appointment process is that, in 2014, South Carolinians will be voting for&nbsp;both of their&nbsp;US Senators: The special election needed because of DeMint's resignation and the seat occupied by Graham, whose term is up.</p>

<p>Graham, who has taken a lot of heat for bucking conservative orthodoxy, is a candidate for a primary <a href="http://www.theitem.com/news/article_04a5811a-5b27-11e1-bebd-001871e3ce6c.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenge</a>. If Davis, a more doctrinaire conservative, is appointed to DeMint's seat, it would effectively eliminate one of Graham's potential competitors.</p>
<h6>Mark Sanford</h6>
<p>The same day DeMint announced his resignation, Sanford <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/12/06/mark-sanford-mulls-second-act-in-south-carolina/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that he is not ruling out a return to politics.</p>

<p>At 52, Sanford is still young enough&nbsp;to continue a political career that already includes three terms in the US House and two terms as governor of South Carolina.</p>

<p>In office, Sanford established himself as a fiscal conservative for wanting an audit of how <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/04/sanford-will-accept-stimulus-funds-on-monday/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stimulus</a> funds would be used and as a civil libertarian for his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUDwp9_MnSY" rel="noopener noreferrer">resistance</a> to Real ID. Despite the torrent of negative attention he received on account of his 2009 extramarital affair, Sanford left office in 2011 with an approval rating of 55%.</p>
