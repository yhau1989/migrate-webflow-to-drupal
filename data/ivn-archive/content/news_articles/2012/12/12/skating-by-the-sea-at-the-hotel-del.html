<p><em>So You Wish You Could Skate</em> is the title that has been given to the first <a href="http://friends.wish.org/024-000/page/So%2520You%2520WISH-You%2520Could%2520Skate/So-You-WISH-You-Could-Skate.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skating by the Sea</a> competition to be held at the Hotel del Coronado's ice skating rink tonight at 6:30pm. A unique spin off of the television show&nbsp;<em>So You Think You Can Dance,&nbsp;</em>the event will entail a skating competition with five teams participating - composed predominantly of local media and celebrities. A portion of proceeds from the skating rink will benefit the <a href="http://www.makeawish-sd.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make-A-Wish Foundation</a> of San Diego.</p>
<p>"The Del" as it is commonly known, has been hosting Skating by the Sea for the past eight years. Contrasting the warmth and atmosphere of the Pacific Ocean to the compact ice skating rink, the hotel has created an original southern California winter experience. Adults and children alike flock yearly to the hotel to partake in their holiday festivities. Hosted on the oceanfront Windsor Lawn of the hotel, the skating rink remains operational from November 21 to around January 5.</p>
