<p>In response to the recent concern over the looming fiscal cliff, President Obama held a tweet chat today at 2pm Eastern, focusing on the middle class tax cuts. Asking Twitter users to discuss "What does $2k mean to you," Obama emphasized that if Congress fails to act before January 1, taxes would increase $2,200 for a typical middle-class family of four.</p>
