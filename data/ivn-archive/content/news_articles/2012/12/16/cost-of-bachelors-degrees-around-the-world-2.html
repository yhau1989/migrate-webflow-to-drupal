<p>With the ever rising costs of tuition in the United States, how do we rank globally? While the costs of attending a public university, on average, is just over $7k, the elitism of attending private universities in this country has its price, at almost four times the cost.</p>

<p>Where can you get a decent education and not worry about exorbitant fees? Germany, Italy, and Mexico are among the most affordable countries at around one thousand dollars or less a year.</p>

<p>What is the most expensive bachelor's degree in the United States, with the least amount of paying jobs? The answer may not be easy to guess. A degree in Art Therapy from the School of Visual Arts in New York City costs over $30,000 annually, but will only earn you an average salary of about $25k per year.</p>
