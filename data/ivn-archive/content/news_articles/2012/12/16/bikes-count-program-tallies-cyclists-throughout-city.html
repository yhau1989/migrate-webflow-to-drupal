<p>With the introduction of <a href="http://ivn.us/san-diego/2012/11/18/decobike-san-diegos-2013-bike-sharing-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DECOBIKE</a>, the city's official bike-sharing program, and the burgeoning relationship between local government and the bicycle community, San Diego is quickly progressing as a "bike-friendly" city.&nbsp;Bikes Count is a program that entails the installation of tallying devices along bike paths and streets, which calculate the number of cyclists and pedestrians traversing the area.</p>

<p>The program is sponsored by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, SDSU, and the San Diego Association of Governments (<a href="http://www.sandag.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SANDAG</a>). There are currently twenty-eight bike-counting devices throughout fourteen of the cities in the county. More counters will ultimately be installed as the program expands,&nbsp;according to a <a href="http://www.countynewscenter.com/news/bikes-count-project-tallies-cyclists-countywide" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> by the San Diego County News Center.</p>

<p>Dr. Dean Sidelinger, Child Health Medical Officer for the County of San Diego said in the post:</p>
<blockquote>“Bicycling and walking are easy ways to increase daily physical activity to stay healthy and reduce the chances of getting a chronic disease. Collecting this information helps promote bicycle riding, and increases choices for everyone to include biking and walking in their routines.”</blockquote>
<p>The Bikes Count program is funded Healthy Works, which is a $16 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bike Count is administered by the county, and Healthy Works is operational under <a href="http://www.livewellsandiego.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Well, San Diego!</a> which entails the county's continued work in "healthy, safe, and thriving individuals, neighborhoods, and the community."</p>

<p>2012 has been a big year for cycling in San Diego, but this past week in particular has seen a flurry of activity throughout the cycling community. IVN recently published a story on the San Diego Bike Coalition celebrating community leaders' support of programs that will ultimately make the city one of most bike-friendly in the entire country.</p>
