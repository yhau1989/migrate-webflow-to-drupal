<p>This week on IVN, we have some exciting changes. First, the "Independent Voter Network" will now be exclusively referred to as “IVN.” The purpose of this "rebranding" is to reflect that our commitment to not only voters and politics, but policy and news more generally. We will, however, always remain dedicated to presenting newsworthy and non-partisan issues, while rejecting the sensationalism and gossip that pervades much of the larger dialogue.</p>

<p>Additionally, IVN began the first of several pilot programs this past week with a well-attended "tweet chat" on the applications of Twitter during 2012 election. This week, IVN will launch a podcast which wil be the&nbsp;first&nbsp;installment&nbsp;of IVN Radio. The first topic wil be, “The Republican Brand and Young Voters,” and will go live Thursday, December 13, 2012.</p>

<p>IVN remains committed to providing news that is often not covered extensively by major news outlets. Last week, some of the topics our&nbsp;contributors&nbsp;covered were the <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/09/the-climate-change-discussions-fails-once-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doha UN Climate Change Conference</a> in Qatar, the future of the <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/07/could-the-anti-war-movement-reemerge-in-obamas-second-term/" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-war movement</a>, the divided American position on <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/04/americans-are-at-odds-over-the-legalization-of-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">marijuana legalization</a>, and <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/12/05/robert-reich-three-cliffs-scarier-than-the-fiscal-cliff/" rel="noopener noreferrer">three “cliffs”</a> scarier than the “fiscal cliff.” The IVN platform also provides readers with a fresh perspective on some of the biggest news stories nationwide, including November’s <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/12/07/us-adds-146000-jobs-in-november-unemployment-rate-drops/" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs report</a> and President Obama’s meeting with <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/08/president-meets-with-business-roundtable-hopes-for-influence/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Roundtable</a>.</p>
