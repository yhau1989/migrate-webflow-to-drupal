<p>The Better Business Bureau has named seven recipients of its annual Torch Awards for Marketplace Ethics. Tuesday, the BBB awarded On-Site Tech Support, Dream Design Builders, Reilly Financial Advisors, Quality Controlled Manufacturing Inc., Coles Fine Flooring, W Floor Covering, and Pacific Safety Center with the Torch, which recognizes businesses dedicated to ethics and integrity in the San Diego marketplace.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.on-sitetechsupport.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">On-Site Tech Support</a>, awarded the Torch in the 1-4 employee category, collaborates with businesses to provide IT strategies and consultations. In the 5-10 employee category, <a href="http://www.dreamdesignbuilders.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dream Design Builders</a>, was recognized for its ethical approach to offering design-build remodeling services. <a href="https://www.rfadvisors.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reilly Financial Advisors</a>, who proved victorious in the 11-24 employee category, offers integration of investment, wealth and relationship management. <a href="http://qualitycontrolledmanufacturinginc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quality Controlled Manufacturing Inc.,</a> with 25-99 employees, won the Torch Award with its production runs of parts for aerospace, industrial, commercial, and power generation industries. &nbsp;The BBB recognized two flooring companies this year, <a href="http://www.colesfineflooring.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coles Fine Flooring</a>&nbsp; for the 100-249 employee category and <a href="http://www.jwfloors.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JW Floor Covering</a> for the 250-499 employee category. <a href="http://www.psc411.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacific Safety Center</a>, an organization dedicated to education and awareness of safety, took home the award for the charity and non-profit company. As San Diego’s winners of the BBB’s Torch Awards, these businesses will be eligible to participate in the international competition.</p>

<p>The winners of the Torch Awards are determined by an independent panel of judges who review binders containing information on how each business vying for the award conducts their business in terms of their employees, customers, vendors, and the San Diego community. Better Business Bureau President and CEO Sheryl Bilbrey <a href="http://sandiego.bbb.org/article/San-Diego-BBB-congratulates-the-seven-ethical-recipients-of-the-2012-Torch--38736" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> of the winners,&nbsp;“These are the companies that San Diegans should take note of; not only do they do excellent work in their respective industries, but they treat those connected to their business with the utmost respect, trust and gratitude.”</p>

<p>In an era rife with Yelp reviews, the Better Business Bureau has surely seen better business days, but its annual Torch Awards help facilitates its mission to promote ethics and transparency in business and provides consumers with free pre-purchase information.</p>
