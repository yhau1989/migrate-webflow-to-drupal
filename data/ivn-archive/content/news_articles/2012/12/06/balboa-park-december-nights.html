It is an exciting two-night event that brings together over 300,000 visitors to enjoy the festival starting this Friday December 7<span>,</span>&nbsp;which will continue until Saturday, December 8.&nbsp; December Nights is now entering its thirty-fifth consecutive year in Balboa Park and is the community’s’ largest free event.
