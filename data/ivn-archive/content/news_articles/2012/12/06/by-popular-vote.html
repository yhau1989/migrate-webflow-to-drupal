<p>Today is the first day that same-sex couples are allowed to get married in the state of Washington. &nbsp;The legislation permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Chris Gregoire on February 13, 2012, but it was stayed pending a vote of the people. &nbsp;In every instance of same-sex marriage going to the vote of the people, it had been voted down. &nbsp;But the general election of 2012 would turn out to be more interesting than all the years prior.</p>

<p>Washington was not the only state voting on same-sex marriage. &nbsp;Maryland had also passed by same-sex marriage through its legislature and the people of the state were voting, too. &nbsp;The people of Minnesota were voting on whether to ban same-sex marriage in their state. &nbsp;And in the state of Maine, the people were voting to overturn its ban on same-sex marriage which was put in effect in 2009 after same-sex marriage was signed by the the governor earlier that year. &nbsp;National polls in recent years have showed a shift in favor of same-sex marriage, but that has never played out in state contests. &nbsp;Earlier this year, North Carolina voted 61%-39% to ban same-sex marriage... becoming the last southern state to put a ban in place.</p>

<p>It was stated at the beginning, more or less, how the state of Washington ended up voting. &nbsp;The final vote was 53%-47% in favor. &nbsp;Why might this be important. &nbsp;I stated earlier that national polls had shown a shift by the people to support same-sex marriage recently. &nbsp;In a poll conducted from November 16-19, same-sex marriage was supported by 51% with 40% opposed. &nbsp;This was preceded by another poll, this time conducted by ABC News/Washington Post from November 7-11, found that 51% approved and 47% were opposed to same-sex marriage. &nbsp;And just to add one more layer onto this, a June 6 CNN/ORC International polls showed that 52% approved same-sex marriage with 42% opposed. &nbsp;This is a dramatic shift in support as only 25% approved of same-sex marriage in 1996. &nbsp;By looking at the percentages in the states Maine, Maryland, and Washington, they are pretty much right on the national poll numbers. &nbsp;The state of Minnesota, voted down their marriage ban by almost the same numbers as well.</p>

<p>Critics of same-sex marriage have always changed their tactics. &nbsp;When state courts started overturning laws that violated that particular state's constitution, the opposition started declaring that the legislatures had to approve of such things. &nbsp;When legislatures started approving same-sex marriages, critics started saying that a vote of the people should make the determination. &nbsp;Then they would set out on a 'fear and smear' campaign to get voters to approve of same-sex marriage bans. &nbsp;But with some states, victory for equal rights had already been accomplished. &nbsp;And with the passage of time, people have been able to see the lies that came with the 'fear and smear' campaigns of earlier years. &nbsp;As the years continue to progress, it would seem that same-sex marriage will only garner more and more approval from the people. &nbsp;States that currently have bans in place might even follow Maine and vote to overturn them. &nbsp;But one must wonder since referendums in support of same-sex marriage have now been approved by the people, and a referendum banning same-sex marriage has been defeated in the same way, what will be the opposition's next move? &nbsp;No matter what it is, history has already dictated what that outcome will be.</p>
