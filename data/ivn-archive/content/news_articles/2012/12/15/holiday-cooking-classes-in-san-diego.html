<p>It is that time of year again when we get together with our friends and family to partake in the utmost of holiday activities - eating. How does one decide on who will be cooking? As the stress of cooking for the many guests over the holidays can be rather stressful. To help ease the tension out of holiday cooking, several places throughout San Diego are offering holiday cooking classes to help you prepare for the holidays.</p>
