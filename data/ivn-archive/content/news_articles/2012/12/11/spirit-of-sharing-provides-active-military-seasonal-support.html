<p>Each year since 2000, the <a href="http://www.spiritofsharing.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirit of Sharing</a>, based in Oceanside, has run throughout the holiday season to provide seasonal comforts to active duty families throughout southern California. And this year’s fundraising season is well underway!</p>

<p>With over one million charities in the US to choose from, it is often difficult to determine where donated funds and assets will be allocated best. According to the <a href="http://www.independentcharities.org/info.asp?Title=The+ICA+Seal+of+Excellence&amp;sBody=BIA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Charities of America</a>, of the 1,000,000 operating charities, only five percent meet the standards required to participate in the government’s Combined Federal Campaign, which demands public accountability, program efficiency, and cost effectiveness.</p>

<p>In 2010, the Independent Charities of America honored the Spirit of Sharing’s dedication to accountability and efficiency with its <a href="http://www.independentcharities.org/info.asp?Title=The+ICA+Seal+of+Excellence&amp;sBody=BIA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seal of Excellence</a>, which has been awarded to less than two-thousand charities.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Sharing (SOS) provides for families who are nominated or apply to be “adopted” by the foundation. Nominations and applications can be submitted throughout the year, and the selective adoption process allows the SOS insight into the needs and interests of each family it serves. Once the holiday season rolls around, the adopted families receive a week’s worth of groceries. For families with children, the foundation provides age appropriate gifts of clothing, education materials, and toys, which are individually wrapped and personally delivered on Christmas.</p>

<p>Since its founding, the Spirit of Sharing has provided nearly three-hundred families with its seasonal services. The Spirit of Sharing succeeds with the help of volunteers, and volunteer opportunities range from shopping to gift wrapping to delivering packages to the adopted families. If you are interested in donating your time or money to a charitable cause this holiday season, San Diego’s active military personnel and their families will benefit from any contributions made to the Spirit of Sharing.</p>
