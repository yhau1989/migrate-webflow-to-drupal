<p>As the second largest social network in the world, Twitter has transformed the way we interact on and offline. As the year comes to a close, we want to take a closer look at how the social network has impacted 2012. What better way to discuss the topic than by holding a tweet chat.</p>

<p>Twitter not only responded to the current events of 2012, but shaped them. As a year of "firsts," 2012 marks the beginning of a new digital era for journalists, politicians, public figures, voters, athletes, artists, and users worldwide.</p>

<p>This year was the first time a presidential debate was followed on Twitter, marking the beginning of a live fact checking phenomena. In 2012, millions of Americans participated in the&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/infographics/2012/11/08/presidential-election-and-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">most tweeted about event</a>&nbsp;in history: our Presidential election.</p>

<p>The year 2012 is also the first year in which professional athletes were <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/07/30/calling-all-olympic-athletes-think-before-you-tweet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">disqualified</a> from the Olympic Games because of a tweet. It marks the first time Twitter was used as a primary source for information in the days following a natural disaster. &nbsp;Twitter created a space for open communication in the Middle East; not only facilitating protests, but providing the platform to&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/16/in-israel-and-gaza-conflict-twitter-is-a-key-player/" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-tweet</a>&nbsp;a war. In fact, the Israel Defense Force and Hamas both live-tweeted the most recent conflict.</p>

<p>By the numbers, the impact of Twitter is undeniable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The most retweeted photo in history was tweeted by President Obama on November 6, 2012: 785,000.</li>
	<li>90% of Senators &amp; House members, 42 Governors &amp; 35 world leaders have Twitter accounts.</li>
	<li>People sent more than 20 million tweets about Hurricane Sandy between October 27 and November 1st. That's 7 million more tweets than were sent during the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. Combined.</li>
	<li>Since 2011, the number of users on Twitter has more than doubled, rising from 200 million to over 500 million Twitter users.</li>
	<li>With over 31 million tweets, the 2012 election was the most tweeted about event in U.S. politics, peaking at 327,000 tweets per minute.</li>
