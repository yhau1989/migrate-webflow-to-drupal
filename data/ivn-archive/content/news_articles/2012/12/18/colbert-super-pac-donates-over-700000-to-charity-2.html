<p>Appropriately named the Ham Rove Memorial Fund, 'Citizens for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow' commonly referred to as Colbert Super PAC, announced Thursday it was donating $773,704.83 to various charities in remembrance of the PAC's sweet and salty chief strategist.</p>

<p>Colbert stated in a <a href="http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/archive/121312.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="csp">release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Last month, my friend Ham Rove passed away in a very unsuspicious fashion. On the same day, Colbert Super PAC's money, $773,704.83, was squirreled away in a fashion that was extremely suspicious, but entirely legal. I thought that's the last I'd hear from Ham Rove, particular because a dog ate him... I was recently surprised to find myself on the board of the Ham Rove Memorial Foundation. I was equally surprised to learn we received a $773,704.83 donation. Where did that specific amount of money come from? There's simply no way to know"</blockquote>
<p>The donation, originating from P.O. Box 'Bite Me,' highlights the ease with which extremely large sums of untraceable cash can change hands with little to no oversight or regulation.</p>

<p>As per Ham Rove's wishes, the donations will be dispersed among several charities: $125,000 each to Donors Choose, Team Rubicon, and Habitat for Humanity to help fund Hurricane Sandy disaster relief efforts.</p>

<p>The wounded veterans support organization, Yellow Ribbon Fund, will receive $125,000 as well. The remaining 273,704.83 will go to the Center for Responsive Politics and the Campaign Legal Center.</p>

<p>Colbert has donated about half a million dollars to the Yellow Ribbon fund since his show started airing in 2005, a majority coming from his Wrist Strong campaign several years ago.</p>
