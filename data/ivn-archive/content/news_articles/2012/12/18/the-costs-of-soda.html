<p>Soda consumption and its effect on health has been discussed greatly since New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a soda ban for the city of New York. Sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces at restaurants and concession stands are no longer allowed within New York City. Although sugary beverages are still widely available in the city and nationwide, few consider the environmental toll products like soda take on the planet.</p>

<p>Insurancequotes.org made the following video about the hidden costs of soda considering not only its cost on health but also the&nbsp;environmental&nbsp;and economic weight of the soda industry.</p>

<p>Will the information contain in the video change you soda consumption?</p>
