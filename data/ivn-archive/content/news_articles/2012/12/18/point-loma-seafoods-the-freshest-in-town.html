<p>Living by the bountiful Pacific Ocean, San Diegans are rather selective when it it comes to seafood. Though some of the "best" seafood is arguably when one reels in a keeper, cleans it, and takes it home, or dives for spiny lobster. Point Loma Seafoods has carried this sentiment since 1963, and promise in their slogan to provide the "freshest thing in town."</p>

<p><a href="http://pointlomaseafoods.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Point Loma Seafoods</a> was opened by Kelly and Marie Christianson as a "mom and pop" seafood store with only one display case. Like most in the city, Kelly Christianson was an avid sport fisherman, but had no commercial ties to the industry itself. He simply wanted to create a location where residents could pick up the freshest, or tough to find seafood.</p>

<p>The Christianson's sons, Jack and John later joined in their parents business venture - expanding the family business in response to their growing clientele. They also began smoking and processing fish dropped off by local fisherman, cleaning them as soon as they hit the docks. Once they had acquired more employees and a larger staff, they began preparing meals solely for the staff. Word got out, and soon Point Loma Seafoods was selling the freshest seafood, served hot on the best sourdough breads, to customers.&nbsp;This is from where their slogan is derived.</p>

<p>"We fly in fish from all over the world," says Point Loma Seafoods General Manager Timothy Lamb. "The main difference from other seafood retailers is that we have a much wider variety, covering nearly fifty feet of showcase room.&nbsp;Our shellfish is all farmed in federally inspected HASCP facilities, and during October through March locally caught spiny lobster is always available."</p>

<p>Lamb says that their best-sellers are typically Pacific Swordfish and sea bass. During the holidays, however, there is a shift towards Dungeoness crab and lobster, as seafood is a key staple in most coastal cultures.</p>

<p>"No deals" does not entail that one will be liquidating their holiday bonus. As seafood is brought in daily, the selection often varies depending on market price. Regardless of what one selects, freshness and quality is&nbsp;guaranteed, as Point Loma Seafoods sticks to their motto of "the freshest in town."</p>

<p>For nearly fifty years, Point Loma Seafood has been providing neighbors and visitors alike with a quality product. Located on the waterfront near commercial fishing boats, it is a symbolic reminder of the city's ever-present city's fishing past and present.</p>
