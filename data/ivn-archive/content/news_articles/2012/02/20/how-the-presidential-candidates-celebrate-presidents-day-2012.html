<p>While Americans around the country celebrate George Washington's birthday with the day off, the 2012 presidential candidates are hard at work in their campaigns for the White House. With primaries in both Michigan and Arizona a week away, the Republican candidates prepare for the return of the GOP debates, which will be held on Wednesday, February 22, in Arizona. And while there have already been 19 debates this election season, Wednesday's debate could prove to be especially important for candidate Rick Santorum, whose lead in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 consecutive National polls</a> makes him a viable threat to the delegate leader Mitt Romney.</p>

<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2-Barack-Obama.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://2-Barack-Obama.png" width="90"></a>Barack Obama (Democrat):&nbsp;</strong>After calling attention to the need for a better and more affordable higher education system in America during his State of the Union speech, Obama has been taking a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20003733" rel="noopener noreferrer">tougher stance on higher education</a>. His plan includes incentives for schools to ensure students find work, the reduction of costs for students, and the development of "scorecards" for comparing school statistics. While some are enthusiastic about his plans for higher education,&nbsp; Education Secretary Arne Duncan <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20003733" rel="noopener noreferrer">argues</a> that these changes should be made at the state level, not the federal.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3-Ron-Paul.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://3-Ron-Paul.png" width="90"></a></strong><strong>Ron Paul (Republican):</strong>&nbsp;In his appearance on CNN's "State of the Union" last night, Texas Congressman Ron Paul affirmed that he will be staying in the race "<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/la-pn-ron-paul-cnn-santorum-liberal-20120219,0,2260432.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">well into the summer</a>."&nbsp;When asked about Santorum's electability against Obama, he stated:</p>
<blockquote>"His voting record is ... from my viewpoint, an atrocious voting record -- how liberal he's been in all the things he's voted for over the many years he was in the Senate and in the House."</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/5-Buddy-Roemer.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://5-Buddy-Roemer.png" width="90"></a>Buddy Roemer (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>On Thursday, former Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer was passed by Stephen Colbert as the sixth most popular draft candidate for the Americans Elect bid. Ben Jacobs of the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/08/buddy-roemer-s-longshot-presidential-campaign-is-a-study-in-unorthodoxy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Beast </a>notes that Roemer is less concerned about winning the candidacy, however, and is more so trying to spread awareness of the disproportional role of money in politics.</p>

<p><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican): </strong>Despite campaigning efforts in Michigan this weekend, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney trails in the most recent polls. As <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/20/independents-sour-on-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported today on IVN</a>&nbsp;by Damon Eris, this could be due to the decline in support from the&nbsp;Independent&nbsp;voter. He notes,&nbsp;<em>“Over the course of the campaign, Romney’s image among independent voters has suffered substantially,”</em> with a shift in public opinion that now favors Obama over Romney.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/7-Rick-Santorum.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://7-Rick-Santorum.png" width="90"></a>Rick Santorum (Republican):</strong>&nbsp;Speaking to a crowd in Ohio, Santorum was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gop-race-20120220,0,2373129.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted Saturday</a> as calling Obama's faith,&nbsp;<em>"some phony theology. Not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology."</em> Criticizing him for going over the line,&nbsp;the Obama Administration <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-20/santorum-says-obama-s-policies-elevate-the-earth-above-man-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">fired back</a>&nbsp;and labeled Santorum's attack as "wrong" and "destructive." &nbsp;Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's environmental beliefs placing Earth over men. &nbsp;Despite these comments, Santorum is still polling first in the last <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/mi/michigan_republican_presidential_primary-1589.html#polls" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Michigan polls</a>.</p>
