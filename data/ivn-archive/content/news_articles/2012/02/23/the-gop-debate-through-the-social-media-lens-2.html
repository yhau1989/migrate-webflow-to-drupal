<p><strong>As we&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/22/why-tonights-republican-presidential-debate-matters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted yesterday</a>, the debate centered around the differences between&nbsp;front-runner&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitt Romney&nbsp;</a>and emerging leader&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rick-santorum/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Santorum</a>, as they were strategically&nbsp;sandwiched in the center between neglected Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich.</strong></p>
