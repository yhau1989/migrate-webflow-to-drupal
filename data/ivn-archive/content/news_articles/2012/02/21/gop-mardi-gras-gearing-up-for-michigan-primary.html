<p>With next Tuesday's Michigan Primary looming over the GOP candidates and a debate scheduled for tomorrow, tension&nbsp;increases between <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitt Romney</a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rick-santorum/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Santorum</a>. This <a href="http://http://blogs.marketwatch.com/election/2012/02/21/michigan-primary-now-%E2%80%98true-toss-up%E2%80%99/" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary</a> will prove to be an important deciding factor on who will be the front runner for Super Tuesday on March 6th, so it's safe to say Fat Tuesday is the last thing on these candidate's minds. A loss in Michigan for Romney will underscore the difficulty he has in gaining Republican support.</p>

<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1-Newt-Gingrich1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://1-Newt-Gingrich1.png" width="90"></a><strong>Newt Gingrich (Republican):</strong> Wrapping up two days of campaigning in Oklahoma, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/newt-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newt Gingrich</a> attacked the president’s stance on energy issues. Gingrich criticized the delay of the<a href="http://www.newson6.com/story/16979779/newt-gingrich-speaks-to-news-9-ahead-of-address-to-state-legislature" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Keystone XL Pipeline</a>, as a key factor in the U.S. quest for energy independence. During his campaign time in Oklahoma, Gingrich claimed that if elected president he would <a href="http://www.newson6.com/story/16979779/newt-gingrich-speaks-to-news-9-ahead-of-address-to-state-legislature" rel="noopener noreferrer">shrink</a> the role of the Federal government and lower the price of gasoline to $2 per gallon. Gingrich currently trails in Michigan <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/mi/michigan_republican_presidential_primary-1589.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a> behind Santorum, Romney, and Paul.</p>

This is a significant change from his campaign four years ago which promoted more lofty goals for change in Washington. &nbsp;In promoting his “Modest American Dream” President Obama states:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Folks don't have unrealistic ambitions. They do believe that if they work hard they should be able to achieve that small measure of an American Dream."</em></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3-Ron-Paul.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://3-Ron-Paul.png" width="90"></a>Ron Paul (Republican): </strong>In a <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2012/0221/Ron-Paul-s-tough-new-anti-Santorum-ad-Will-it-work-video" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly released ad</a>, Paul attempts to paint Santorum as a fake fiscal conservative. In time for the Michigan Primary next Tuesday, the Paul team hopes to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/21/ron-paul-calls-social-conservatism-a-losing-position-for-republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">deter support for Santorum</a> who is holding on to a lead in the Michigan Primary polls. In other news, Maine’s Republican Party announced Friday that it would recount votes cast in the February 11<sup>th</sup> caucus. Initial result showed a 194-vote victory for Mitt Romney, however, due to weather and an issue with some e-mailed results ended up in a spam folder. Paul supporters hoped this <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-201202211045usnewsusnwr201202170217recountfeb21,0,4219570.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">recalculation</a> of votes might determine Paul as the rightful Maine caucus winner. Tallies from the weekend has Paul <a href="http://www.thebostonchannel.com/mostpopular/30491908/detail.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaining 83 votes</a>, but not enough to surpass Romney as the state victor.</p>

Though he remains trailing slightly behind Santorum in the upcoming Michigan primary, polls show that he is leading in Arizona whose primary is on the same day. At a town hall on Tuesday in Michigan, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitt Romney</a> <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2012/02/mitt_romney_in_shelby_township.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized</a> the Obama Administration, saying it promotes “secular agenda” that has hurt religious freedom in America. He also encouraged tea party voters in Michigan to look into Santorum’s record before giving him their support.</p>

Santorum appealed to blue-collar workers in Michigan stating that the Obama Administration will limit quality of life and lower resources in its plans to combat global warming. In other news, Santorum-backing Super PAC has refunded a $50,000 <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20120221/NEWS15/120221043/super-PAC-Rick-Santorum-refunded-donation" rel="noopener noreferrer">donation</a> from a London-based securities firm.
