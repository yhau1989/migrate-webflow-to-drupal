<p>The Afghanistan War has hit the <a href="http://costofwar.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">half-a-trillion dollar</a> mark today.&nbsp; Launched under President Bush and intensified under President Obama, the war has lasted over eleven years.&nbsp; Just last month, <a href="http://icasualties.org/OEF/index.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">26</a> US soldiers died in this war theater, and 3 have died so far this month. Overall, since the war's inception, <a href="http://icasualties.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,893</a> US soldiers have been killed and over <a href="http://icasualties.org/OEF/USCasualtiesByState.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">14,000</a> have been wounded.</p>

<p>Financially speaking, it should be noted that under both President Bush and President Obama, the Afghanistan War has been financed through deficit spending.&nbsp; Since 2001, the federal budget has never been balanced, which effectively means that the war has been funded through borrowing.&nbsp; And in conjunction with the Iraq War, PTSD and a startling <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120208/us-military-suicides-high-even-wars-draw-down" rel="noopener noreferrer">suicide rate</a> have plagued the US military throughout the same period.</p>

<p>President Obama, who ramped up spending and doubled the number of US troops in Afghanistan, plans to hand over primary security responsibility to Afghan forces by the end of 2013, a year ahead of schedule.&nbsp; GOP presidential candidates Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum have criticized Obama's accelerated withdrawal schedule, while Dr. Ron Paul continues to be the only candidate who advocates a complete and immediate withdrawal.</p>
