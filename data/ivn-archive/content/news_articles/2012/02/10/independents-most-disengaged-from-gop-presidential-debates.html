<p>When it comes to watching the GOP presidential debates this election cycle, Independent voters are more removed from the process than both Republicans and Democrats.&nbsp; The finding comes from a <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/02/07/section-2-debates-and-campaign-outreach/" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> released this week by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.</p>

<p>Pew says that roughly a third of Independents have watched a Republican debate this election cycle. And if there’s a perception that their disinterest lies solely with the Republican Party, think again. Independent viewing remains largely unchanged from four years ago when just 34% watched the debates, debates in which both parties had candidates participating.</p>

<p>What’s especially eye-catching is that 64% of Independents-a strong majority- said that they weren’t watching this election season’s Republican debates. 73% of Independents who lean Democrat said the same.&nbsp; The story is different when it comes to Republican-leaning Independents, however. 47% of them have caught at least one during the current campaign. That is the same percentage as the number of solid Republicans who also watched one.&nbsp; Reflecting a pattern of more consistent engagement, 66% of Republicans who agree with the Tea Party have seen a GOP presidential debate.</p>

<p>The distanced approach of Independents seems to indicate a disconnect of some sort.&nbsp; Ironically, the engagement level in the GOP debates is higher among Democrats than it is with Independents. As a matter of fact, the 44% of Democrats who’ve seen a debate is up ten percentage points from&nbsp; 34% in late 2007, Pew said. Furthermore, many Democrats who watched a debate among their own party’s presidential candidates four years ago were just as likely to watch one of the Republican debates during the current cycle.&nbsp; As for the 47% of Republicans who caught a debate this time, engagement is also up from four years ago when only 32% saw one during the 2008 campaign.</p>

<p>The Pew survey may reveal the very reason why Independents are tuning out. When Americans who watched the debates were asked whether they had learned a lot about the candidates, only 35% of Democrats and Independents said that they did and only 44% of Republicans said the same.</p>

<p>As a result, the Republican candidates appear to be continually struggling on multiple fronts. Not only are they risking turning off Independent voters because of the constant attacks, there’s also the appearance of a GOP enthusiasm gap <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/colorado-minnesota-caucuses-are-the-latest-sign-of-a-gop-enthusiasm-gap/2012/02/08/gIQAbDW9yQ_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">in some parts of the nation&nbsp;where recent caucuses were held</a>.</p>

<p>If the Republicans hope to have any chance of competing in November, they should probably shift their various strategies to find a balance between energizing their base while simultaneously addressing the concerns of Independents hungry for solutions. Voters are desiring ideas, not more politics.</p>

<p>This Pew survey was conducted January 4-8, 2012 among a national sample of 1,507 adults, aged 18 years and older in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The sampling error varied by group: +/- 4 percentage points among the total sample, +/-7.5 percentage points among Republicans, +/-7.5 percentage points among Democrats, and +/-6.5 percentage points among Independents. Additionally, it has a 95% level of confidence.</p>
