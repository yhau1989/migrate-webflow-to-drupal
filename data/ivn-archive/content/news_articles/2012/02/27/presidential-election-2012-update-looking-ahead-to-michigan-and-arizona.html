<p>Tomorrow, Arizona and Michigan will hold their primary elections in what could amount to Mitt Romney's make-or-break moment in the 2012 election.&nbsp;Born and raised in Michigan, this state's primary is critical to Romney's campaign, but it may be a tough win for the candidate, who is neck and neck with opponent Rick Santorum in the <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/02/mitt-romney-rick-santorum-michigan-polls-/1#.T0vRf3JWrEU" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent poll</a>. The <a href="http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=103727" rel="noopener noreferrer">forgotten primary of Arizona</a> could be one of the least watched races of the election, with Romney leading in the polls by <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/arizona/2012_arizona_republican_primary" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 percentage points</a>.</p>

Focusing on energy independence and promoting his campaign to get gas prices down to $2.50, he spent the majority of his 45 minute speech attacking Obama on economic issues. As part of his <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/gingrich-sets-his-sights-1364582.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy to focus on the South</a>, he flew to Georgia on Sunday, and has three campaign stops planned in Tennessee today.</p>

He traveled to Florida this Sunday to attend the Daytona 500, a campaign move which prompted many to ask, "<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2012/0227/Mitt-Romney-at-Daytona-500.-Shouldn-t-he-be-in-Michigan" rel="noopener noreferrer">Should't he have been campaigning in Michigan?</a>" While Romney admitted he does not closely follow the races, he defended his visit by adding, "<em>I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners.</em>" This could be an indication of a confident Romney campaign.</p>
