<p><strong><em>“I don’t believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.&nbsp;The idea that the church should have no influence or no involvement in the operation of the state is absolutely antithetical of the objectives and vision of our country.” -Rick Santorum, on JFK’s 1960 speech on separation of church and state.</em></strong></p>
