<p><strong>The campaign trail today will hold caucuses in both Minnesota and Colorado, with a primary in Missouri...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Newt Gingrich&nbsp;</strong><strong>(Republican):</strong>&nbsp;Increasing the intensity of his rhetoric against Mitt Romney, Gingrich also now faces competition from Rick Santorum, who has been steadily gaining&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/mikesmithson/100135634/stand-aside-newt-gingrich-why-rick-santorum-could-soon-be-mitt-romneys-main-challenger/" rel="noopener noreferrer">momentum</a>. A clerical error has kept Gingrich off the ballot in tonight’s Missouri primary, opening the stage for Santorum to go head to head with Romney.&nbsp;Gingrich will be campaigning in Ohio today focusing on gaining the support of early voters.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2-Barack-Obama.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://2-Barack-Obama.png" width="90"></a>Barack Obama (Democrat):&nbsp;</strong>Controversy arose today over a&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/davidhughes/100135605/obamas-assault-on-catholic-organisations-could-cost-him-dearly/" rel="noopener noreferrer">provision</a>&nbsp;in Obama’s healthcare plan which will require religious charities, universities and other groups to provide contraception in staff insurance plans. The main opponents to this provision are Catholic organizations that are traditionally opposed to contraception. In other news, President Obama has decided to encourage donations to the Priorities USA Action SuperPAC. This demonstrates a<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/gipper-move-president-obama-wont-unilaterally-disarm-on-superpacs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;change</a>&nbsp;in the president’s previous objections to the influence of outside money in election campaigns.</p>

In the Colorado caucuses, Paul has unofficially gained the support of the Northern Colorado Tea Party, the state’s most influential tea party group. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://coloradoindependent.com/112061/ahead-of-caucuses-major-colorado-tea-party-group-promotes-ron-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Colorado Independent</a>, the support of the NC Tea Party will have virtually no effect on Mitt Romney’s performance in the state, but will deter much needed votes away from Gingrich and Santorum.</p>

Romney’s win in Nevada was his second victory in a row and his third of the five contests so far in the run for the GOP nomination. Romney recently began to focus his attacks on Rick Santorum, suggesting a threat of Santorum’s positive <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/politics/politics_campaign-wrap_1_rick-santorum-romney-campaign-mitt-romney?_s=PM:POLITICS" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance</a> in today’s primaries and caucuses.</p>

In Minnesota, his poll numbers of 33% dwarf Romney’s mere 24%. In Missouri, poll numbers reflect the same, with Santorum at 45%, thirteen points above Romney. Romney focused his attacks on Santorum today who, according to<a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/mikesmithson/100135634/stand-aside-newt-gingrich-why-rick-santorum-could-soon-be-mitt-romneys-main-challenger/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Telegraph</a>, could become Romney’s main challenger, above Gingrich.</p>
