<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1-Newt-Gingrich.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://1-Newt-Gingrich.png" width="90"></a>Newt Gingrich (Republican): </strong>Today, former House Speaker Gingrich returns to his home state to hold two campaign events this evening in Georgia. His visit comes a week after former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney campaigned in the state, and just before Rick Santorum's visit to Georgia. &nbsp;Earlier this week, Gingrich spent time fundraising in California, exceeding his overall campaign fundraising goal of $2 million. It is <a href="http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2012/02/16/gingrich-raises-money-places-bet-california" rel="noopener noreferrer">unclear</a> how much money was raised in the Golden State, but he held eight&nbsp;fundraisers&nbsp;during his four day trip.</p>

Guzman reports:</p>
<blockquote>"29% of Independents at the moment say that the president’s policies have made the economy better, 34% say that his policies have made the economy worse, and 29% say that they’ve had no effect so far."</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3-Ron-Paul.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://3-Ron-Paul.png" width="90"></a>Ron Paul (Republican):</strong>&nbsp;Under fire from Ron Paul supporters, the Maine Republican Party has agreed to recount the votes from the state's caucus. In an email from the State Republican Party, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72989.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">a staffer wrote:</a></p>
<blockquote>"We are reconfirming the totals from the&nbsp;Presidential&nbsp;Preference Straw poll. Can you please EMAIL ME the totals from your towns."</blockquote>
<p>Although the caucus is non-binding and delegates will be awarded later in May, this could give Ron Paul his first victory, as he trailed Mitt Romney by a mere 200 votes.</p>

He&nbsp;will be interviewed on the New America Media live radio show&nbsp;“<a href="http://www.thenewamericanmedia.com/TNAM-Radio/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agree to Disagree</a>” today at 2:30 PST.</p>

<p><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican): </strong>Mitt Romney spoke at a Chamber of Commerce meeting yesterday in Michigan, attacking Rick Santorum for defending labor. He stated, "I've taken on union bosses before, and I'm happy to take them on again," repeating, "I won't give in to the United Auto Workers." While the primary is open to Independents and Democrats, union leaders stated they have <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2012/02/17/mitt_romney_risking_union_ire_in_mich_slams_santorums_labor_votes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">no plans on meddling</a> in the GOP primary, but will make it very clear how they feel about Romney during the general election.</p>

Santorum's surge can also be seen in Arizona, where despite his "<a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/02/17/on-shoestring-budget-santorum-could-win-arizona-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoestring</a>" operation, he could win the primary due to his support from the Tea Party and recent resentment towards front-runner Mitt Romney.&nbsp;Santorum will appear on Sunday's screening of <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57380154/sunday-on-face-the-nation-rick-santorum/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Face the Nation</a> on CBS.</p>
