<p>A <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/02/13/santorum-catches-romney-in-gop-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Poll</a> released yesterday reveals Obama leading against potential Republican candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, with Santorum matching Romney in National opinion while overtaking him among&nbsp;Tea Party Republicans and white evangelicals voters.</p>

<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1-Newt-Gingrich.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://1-Newt-Gingrich.png" width="90"></a>Newt Gingrich (Republican):</strong> The former House Speaker continues his campaign in California, with no signs of backing down. President of the&nbsp;Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Richard Land, suggests that the right thing to do would be for Gingrich to back out and endorse Rick Santorum.&nbsp;To which <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/newt-worry-gingrich/story?id=15605283#.TzvpCkxWrEU" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC reporter Matt Negrin</a> responds:</p>
<blockquote>"The chances of Gingrich losing his ego and quitting the race before he absolutely he has to are lower than that of Michele Bachmann getting back in the race and winning the primary."</blockquote>

He leads Romney by 6 points, Santorum by 7, Paul by 11, and Gingrich by 18.

<p><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican):</strong> A new <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/02/13/santorum-catches-romney-in-gop-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Poll</a> shows Republican front-runner Mitt Romney slipping in the National polls, <strong><em>most&nbsp;drastically&nbsp;among independent voters</em></strong>. In November, only 22 percent of independents rated Romney "somewhat or very negatively," a number that has almost doubled in just two months. In the most recent poll, Romney was rated "somewhat or very negatively" by 42 percent on independents.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/romneys-negative-ratings-soaring-among-independents/2012/01/27/gIQAeVB1VQ_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pollster Peter Hart</a>&nbsp;attributes&nbsp;the 20 point drop to:</p>
<blockquote>“Romney’s lack of connection with average people and Obama’s improving numbers on the economy account for the turnaround with independents.”</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/7-Rick-Santorum.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://7-Rick-Santorum.png" width="90"></a>Rick Santorum (Republican):</strong> While Romney continues to slip in the polls, the Pew Research Poll shows <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/02/13/santorum-catches-romney-in-gop-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">surging support</a> for Rick Santorum among Tea Party Republicans and white evangelicals, which has <em>"now pulled him into a virtual tie with Mitt Romney in the race for the Republican presidential nomination."&nbsp;</em>The numbers also show Santorum leading in the National polls, with&nbsp;30% support from Republican registered voters, a 16 point increase since November.</p>
