<p>Here are the results from the Nevada Caucuses, courtesy of the&nbsp;<a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/2012-election-gop-results-map-nevada/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times Data Desk</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the results are not final, it looks like another victory for Mitt Romney, with a strong finish for Ron Paul, who came within 2% of Newt Gingrich’s second place win. Rick Santorum’s fourth place finish is no surprise, seeing as he spent most of the week campaigning in Colorado. Check in tomorrow with the&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Network</a>&nbsp;for a full update of the Nevada Caucuses and the Presidential Election!&nbsp;</p>
