<p>The confluence of the Susan G. Komen/Planned Parenthood debacle and the growth in anonymous corporate donations to presidential candidates serves as a reminder that the nation’s spending priorities are seriously skewed from the common good because of politics.</p>

<p>On one hand, plutocratic multi-millionaires are shelling out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june12/campaign_02-01.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">unprecedented amounts of cash</a> through Super PACs that are outside the control of the politicians they support or the party apparatus.&nbsp; On the other, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/02/susan-g-komen-foundation-cuts-planned-parenthood-funding-over-abortion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">political concerns</a> appear to have influenced the Komen Foundation – a 501(c)3 charitable organization focused on finding a&nbsp; cure for breast cancer – to first pull its funding from Planned Parenthood and then, under heavy <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72386.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">media-driven pressure</a>, restore it.&nbsp; Planned Parenthood is the nation’s largest provider of women’s health services such as breast screenings and reproductive counseling.</p>

<p>Planned Parenthood has been under attack for years by conservative organizations ostensibly because it provides abortion services.&nbsp; But there is also a general discomfort among right-wing groups with the kinds of reproductive services (including contraception) that Planned Parenthood offers.&nbsp; Some conservative politicians have incorrectly identified abortions as the largest part of Planned Parenthood’s services.&nbsp; In reality, abortion services represent just <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201202040003" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 percent</a> of the organization’s activities, though others claim it's a higher percentage.</p>

<p>The Komen Foundation announced last week that it was withdrawing its annual $680,000 stipend that supports Planned Parenthood’s breast-cancer screening program. &nbsp;Before Komen had reversed its decision, the funds had <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-02/planned-parenthood-replaces-komen-grant-with-online-push.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely been replaced</a> by voluntary contributions, including $250,000 from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Komen argued that de-funding Planned Parenthood had nothing to do with the agency’s abortion services and was based on a new rule that it may not fund agencies under investigation.&nbsp; Planned Parenthood is undergoing a highly partisan Congressional investigation to determine if any government-provided funds go toward abortion services, which is illegal under the Hyde amendment.</p>

<p>The Planned Parenthood funding is chicken feed in comparison with the kind of campaign contributions being collected and spent by presidential candidates through their doppelganger Super PACs.&nbsp; Tens of millions of dollars have been funneled into these near-anonymous funding structures that have little or no accountability to candidates, parties or truth.&nbsp; Super PACs were the unintended consequence of the Supreme Court’s <em>Citizens United</em> decision that declared money spent by corporations for political purposes is a form of free speech. Under the Constitution, freedom of speech is a protected right of all U.S. citizens that may not be abridged by campaign finance reform laws or regulations of the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>In my view, something seems grossly off-kilter about the fact that Planned Parenthood and Komen – two organizations devoted to public health issues – are fighting over less than $700,000 in funding, while politicians spend millions to buy votes.&nbsp; The public benefit of political spending at this level must be questioned when the country has so many other needs:&nbsp; infrastructure, education, and health care among them.</p>

<p>If wealthy individuals and corporations can afford to drop millions of dollars into political campaigns, why shouldn’t they be required through taxation to devote a larger percent of their wealth to the public good?&nbsp; It’s hard to imagine a more wasteful use of money than the ephemeral political campaign.&nbsp; The good done for society through millions spent on campaign contributions simply doesn’t hold a candle to contributions in support of curing a disease, making college educations more affordable or repairing our roads and bridges.&nbsp; Other than the purchase of influence and an improved revenue stream for media outlets, there doesn’t seem to be much societal value to Super PAC spending.</p>

<p>It would be a shame to see more tax legislation enacted to correct these skewed prerogatives, but it’s equally shameful to watch resources that could be available for the public good instead go down a rabbit hole of political campaigns.</p>
