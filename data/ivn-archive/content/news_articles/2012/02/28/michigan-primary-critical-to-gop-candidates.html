<p>All eyes on <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/michigan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michigan</a> today, as the state holds its primary in what has been labeled Romney's first must-win primary. Michigan's polls show Romney and Santorum neck and neck, making today's primary critical. Another wild card is the fact that Michigan's primary is open, meaning Democrats and Independents can participate. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/arizona/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arizona</a> voters also hit the polls today in what appears to be a safe win for Romney. Combined, 59 delegates are up for grabs in today's primaries.</p>

<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

Unlike the remaining three Republican candidates, he will not be campaigning in Michigan and Arizona and instead took this week to "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/newt-gingrich-michigan-primary-arizona-primary_n_1305628.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">develop his message about gasoline prices.</a>" He plans to get gas prices down to $2.50/gallon, and due to the increasing prices of gas, Gingrich believes this will appeal to voters.</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;<em>"With the economy in complete free-fall, there weren't any private investors or companies willing to take a chance on the auto industryâ€¦The heartbeat of American manufacturing was flatlining. And we had to make a choice."</em></blockquote>

<p><strong>Ron Paul (Republican):</strong>&nbsp;Although Paul's chances of winning the state are low, Michigan's delegates are&nbsp;allotted&nbsp;proportionately, meaning each district has a certain number of delegates up for grabs. He has been campaigning in the state and according to a recent <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/28/rasmussen-poll-ron-paul-leads-obama-for-the-first-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rasmussen Report</a>, is leading Obama in national polls by 2%. This is the first time the former Texas Congressman has come out on top of the President in a&nbsp;hypothetical&nbsp;2012 match-up.</p>

<p><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican): </strong>&nbsp;Although he served in Massachusetts, Michigan is Mitt Romney's home state, putting added pressure on the presidential candidate to win in today's primary. With the <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/27/presidential-election-2012-update-looking-ahead-to-michigan-and-arizona/" rel="noopener noreferrer">exception of a visit to Florida</a> this weekend, Romney has been campaigning&nbsp;aggressively&nbsp;in the state and is tied in the polls with Rick Santorum. A win for Romney could be the push he needs to gain the support of the Republican party, while a loss in his home state could lead to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/25/mitt-romney-michigan-primary_n_1300985.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">long fight for the Republican nomination</a>.</p>

In fact, his attack on Obama could actually work in his favor. A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/santorums-snob-comment-could-resonate-among-michigans-high-percentage-of-non-college-degree-holders/2012/02/28/gIQAbAjDgR_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">closer look at the electorate</a> in the state shows that six in ten voters do not have a college degree, a higher percentage than in any of the previous states to hold primaries. A victory in Michigan could elevate the former Pennsylvania Senator to frontrunner status, giving him some much needed momentum for next week's Super Tuesday.</p>
