<p>Mitt Romney won the popular vote last night in both the Michigan and Arizona primaries. But while his victory in Arizona's winner-take-all primary guarantees him all 29 delegates, Michigan's delegate distribution is not so simple. <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/27/republican-primary-spotlight-on-delegate-count/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kymberly Bays explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Michigan hosts an open primary where any registered voter, regardless of party preferences, can participate. The state has a total of 30 delegates. The statewide winner will get two. The remaining 28 Michigan delegates will be chosen 2-by-2 in winner-take-all by individual congressional district contests.</blockquote>
<p>Of the congressional districts that have already been counted, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have received the same amout of delegates, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/140866373.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tied at 11</a>.</p>

Out of the 10 states that will hold primaries on March 6th, Georgia has the most delegates with 76. Departing from the typical winner-take-all system, for a candidate to win all 76 delegates in Georgia, he or she must win 50% of the statewide vote.</p>
