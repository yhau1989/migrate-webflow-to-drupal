<p><em>“WASHINGTON - Mitt Romney’s victory in Michigan’s primary won’t get him many more delegates than Rick Santorum, if any. It’s even possible Santorum could win most of the state’s delegates.</em></p>
<p><em>With 22 of the state’s 30 delegates decided, Romney and Santorum each have 11. Michigan awards most of its delegates based on results in each of its 14 congressional districts — handing out two for winning each district.</em></p>
<p><em>Incomplete results in the four remaining congressional districts show Romney and Santorum splitting the final delegates. But that outcome could change as more votes are tallied.</em></p>
<p><em>Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul were shut out.</em></p>
<p><em>Romney won all 29 delegates in Arizona’s primary Tuesday. Overall, Romney leads the race for delegates with 163. Santorum has 83, Gingrich has 32 and Paul has 19.”</em></p>
