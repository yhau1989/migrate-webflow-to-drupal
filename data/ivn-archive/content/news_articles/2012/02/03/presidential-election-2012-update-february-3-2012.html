<p>On the eve of the Nevada Caucuses, the Republican presidential candidates make their final arguments to Nevada voters today. A recent poll conducted by <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/nevada-poll-gives-romney-wide-lead/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannon Survey Center at the University of Nevada</a> finds that Romney is the favorite, supported by 45 percent of the likely caucusgoers. While he's not on the road campaigning like the rest of the presidential candidates, Barack Obama is partaking in his own campaigning in Washington. Fully aware of the significance of veterans in the upcoming election, he is pushing for legislation to help employ recently returning veterans.</p>

<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Newt Gingrich (Republican): </strong>Continuing in the GOP race for the presidential nomination, Gingrich has just two campaign stops planned for today. Since being in Nevada, he has made very <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/gingrich-set-to-make-1329981.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">few public appearances</a>, speaking twice in Las Vegas and once in Reno. The <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/gingrich-set-to-make-1329981.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlantic Journal Constitution</a> suggests his light schedule could mean he's fundraising behind the scenes to fund his campaign until Super Tuesday in March.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2-Barack-Obama.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://2-Barack-Obama.png" width="90"></a>Barack Obama (Democrat): </strong>In Washington, President Obama is addressing the issue of veteran jobs programs, saying<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/02/03/obama_plans_push_for_veterans_jobs_programs/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> he wants to</a> "do all he can to make sure troops come home to new jobs and opportunities." <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/02/03/obama_plans_push_for_veterans_jobs_programs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Boston Globe</a> reports that several states that will be highly competitive in the November election are home to a significant number of military veterans, a statistic the Obama administration is well aware of.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3-Ron-Paul.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://3-Ron-Paul.png" width="90"></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Ron&nbsp;</strong><strong>Paul (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>The next stop on the campaign trail for Texas Congressman Ron Paul is Maine, a state highly populated by <a href="http://ivn.us/news/2012/02/03/ron-paul%E2%80%99s-declined-invitation-to-cpac-shows-independent-an-streak/" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent voters</a>. Ron Paul declined an invitation to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to continue campaigning in Maine, hoping to collect some of the state's 24 delegates. Despite the state's tendency to vote for the Democratic presidential ticket, a <a href="http://ivn.us/news/2012/02/03/ron-paul%E2%80%99s-declined-invitation-to-cpac-shows-independent-an-streak/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll</a> indicates that Obama's approval rating is still below 50%, giving any GOP contender a chance in the state.</p>

Buddy Roemer has been fiercely advocating getting money out of politics, using his Twitter to promote his&nbsp;campaign.

<p><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican):</strong>&nbsp; While campaigning in Las Vegas yesterday, Mitt Romney received the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-poised-for-second-win-in-a-week-in-gop-contest/2012/02/02/gIQANOIakQ_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsement</a> of real estate "mogul" Donald Trump. While he snatched the endorsement from rival Newt Gingrich, it might work against him, given his recent slip on issues of wealth. As reported yesterday, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mitt-romney-i-m-concerned-poor-article-1.1015303?localLinksEnabled=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney told CNN reporters</a>,&nbsp;"I'm not concerned about the very poor, we have a safety net there." Romney is still leading in Nevada polls with the caucuses to be held on February 4th.</p>

Despite the lack of media attention, Santorum is doing particularly <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/mikesmithson/100134722/another-twist-in-the-republican-race-rick-santorum-is-on-track-to-win-missouri/" rel="noopener noreferrer">well in the polls</a>, scoring highly on the "favorability" ratings. Among likely Republican voters, he is the least disliked of the candidates.</p>
