<p>President Obama began his news conference today with a public service announcement for all American men, reminding them that today is <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7398641n" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentine's Day</a> and telling them to “go big”. Possibly an underlying &nbsp;message urging spending to boost the economy?</p>

Titled “Liberals Love Romney”, Gingrich hopes to emphasize the problems Romney has had in gaining the trust of conservatives. Despite loosing ground to Santorum, Gingrich stated yesterday that he has a new determination to stay positive and will keep his&nbsp;<a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/02/14/newt-gingrich-vows-to-stay-in-republican-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign</a>&nbsp;strong.</p>

The tax cut will put $40 back into the paychecks of ordinary Americans, and the president has been stressing the importance of this extension in the face of rising gas prices and the economy. In other news President Obama will be meeting with Chinese Vice President&nbsp;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204883304577220622642693642.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Xi Jinping</a> today, strengthening relations between the world’s two biggest economies.</p>

The theme for the fundraiser is, “No one but Paul”, indicating the strong and loyal continual support of Paul followers. A group of Paul supporters in Maryland are urging his followers there to change their political registration to Republican in order to be able to vote for Paul in <a href="http://www.stardem.com/news/local_news/article_7a7941f5-1347-507a-b5c5-00dac422f12b.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryland’s primary</a> on April 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

The article is written in the form of a letter to Xi Jinping, calling attention to the imbalanced trade between the U.S. and China. He states:</p>
<blockquote>"The imbalanced and unfair trade that exists between our nations is not sustainable. It will be corrected. We expect healthy trade to be fair, balanced and smart for both parties."<strong>&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>

Romney’s focus on Michigan shows the state’s significance amongst the upcoming primaries. According to The Washington Post, Michigan, once seen as an easy win for Romney, is now shaping up to be one of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-faces-major-test-in-michigan-primary-once-thought-an-easy-win/2012/02/14/gIQAffpcDR_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest tests</a> for his campaign yet. According to a new poll, Romney is trailing slightly to Santorum in his home state. A loss for Romney in Michigan could be a major turning point in the Republican primary race.</p>

He is seeking to push out Gingrich and Paul as mere footnotes in the campaign. Last week his campaign raised over $3 million in funds. In other news, Santorum stated yesterday that the Occupy movement represents “<a href="//www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57377121-503544/santorum-calls-occupy-movement-intolerant-as-protestors-interrupt-him/" rel="noopener noreferrer">true intolerance</a>”.
