<p>Kicking off the 2012 California Republican Conference, CRP Chairman Thomas Del Beccaro spoke of his vision of the state party this election cycle.</p>
<p>“We’re pushing social media boundaries and technology in order to reach new levels.”</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It’s not changing procedures that is going to bring back Republicans.&nbsp;Independents rise and fall based on whether the major parties are providing solutions, so our focus is not on procedural rules, but on practical solutions. Changing procedural rules is not how to move our brand forward.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We need Republican candidates to run behind popular ideas. Sadly, Republicans in the past haven’t integrated with those ideas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I tell our candidates all the time, in order to reach voters, come with practical solutions,” Del Beccaro continued. “Regardless of the system, Republicans need to do a better job at that. That is the key”</p>
