<p>This weekend, members of the Independent Voter Network team are attending the 2012 California Democratic Convention in San Diego. Kymberly Bays, our lovely new editor, Benjamin Wong, our tech-savvy film and media intern, and myself will be covering the events as they unfold, with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23CADEM12" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-tweets and updates</a>! Some of the key events planned for this weekend are:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Friday:</strong> Press Conference with Chairman John Burton and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, followed by a reception featuring&nbsp;grassroots&nbsp;activist Van Jones.

<strong>Saturday:</strong>&nbsp;Governor Brown will take the stage in the morning, followed by a luncheon featuring Senator Dianne Feinstein and a dinner with keynote speaker Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. &nbsp;The Convention will then host its annual DEM 2012 Concert, with special guest neo soul singer Eli 'Paperboy' Reed.

<strong>Sunday:</strong> The pre-primary endorsement review committee will meet in the morning and the delegates will adopt a party platform, ratify endorsements, and debate possible June Propositions.</blockquote>
<p>On both Friday and Saturday night, Hospitality Suites will begin at 10pm and end at midnight, giving the delegates an opportunity to network with fellow Democrats from around the state.&nbsp;Compared to the celebratory and positive tone that characterized last years convention, this year is likely to take on a more serious and somber tone. As <a href="http://ivn.us/news/2012/02/08/california-democratic-convention-preview-what-to-expect/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kym Bays reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Stakes are higher this time around, as it’s an election year and big changes to the California electoral landscape are ensuring this year’s Convention has different tone...This year, California has a new map of legislative districts and open primaries complicating things for a party that was already winning quite easily.</blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect to hear from the Democrats on some of these main issues and would love your input! We asked on Twitter:</strong></p>
