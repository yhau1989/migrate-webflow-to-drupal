<p>Dr. Leo J. Shapiro interviewed 1,065 Arizona residents 10 consecutive days ending 25 September. &nbsp;Shapiro’s research is nationally recognized for carefully constructed probes designed to minimize the common error created by bias questions. &nbsp;Before Obama supporters start dancing in the desert, note that the poll finds the actual outcome remains uncertain. Obama’s support is higher among the 12% who said they do not plan to vote.&nbsp; If they did vote, Obama would lead Romney 39.4% to 24.9% with 35.7% undecided.</p>

<p>Shapiro discovered dimensions of this presidential race that neither the Obama or Romney camp will find easy to accept.&nbsp; Arizonan voters were asked whether they believe “the real problems facing the nation will not be solved no matter who is elected President.”&nbsp; Among those who say they will vote, half did not feel their vote matters.</p>

<p>Probing deeper into the electorate’s psyche, Shapiro asks another unorthodox question -&nbsp; does a desire to sustain their personal happiness influence the likelihood that someone will vote?&nbsp; &nbsp;The survey found that among the 15.8 percent of Arizona residents who are happiest and, therefore have the most to lose if things go wrong with the nation, 94.1% plan to vote.&nbsp; And visa versa.&nbsp; Among those least happy (19%) who have the least to lose if things go wrong with the nation, 79.8% plan to vote.</p>

<p>Have both campaigns ignored what might be the most significant, local issue of all – an issue that the Founders set as a national goal - the pursuit of happiness?</p>
