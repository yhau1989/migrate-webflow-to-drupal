<p>The third-party debate will feature four candidates who are coming together tonight to debate issues that Americans are concerned about. Some of these candidates will be more familiar than others, but Larry King will moderate the discussion. Questions will be presented from Americans who have submitted questions to #AskemLarry across social media platforms.</p>

<p>The participants include: Gov. Gary Johnson, Dr. Jill Stein, Rocky Anderson, and Virgil Goode. Al-Jazeera has agreed to broadcast the third-party debate around the world. This expanded conversation will expose more viewpoints to the American public and further open our political dialogue.</p>
