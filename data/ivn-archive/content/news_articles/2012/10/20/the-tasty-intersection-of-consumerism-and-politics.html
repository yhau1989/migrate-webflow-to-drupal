<p>What do chicken wings, cocktails, cupcakes and coffee have to do with politics? More than you’d think.</p>

<p>In downtown San Diego, new Gaslamp Quarter bar/eatery The Commons is selling Right Wing and Left Wing deals. For $12, you can order five Buffalo wings and a Right-Wing cocktail (peach vodka, soda water and cranberry juice); or five spicy bleu wings and a Left-Wing drink (blueberry vodka, blue Curacao liqueur, soda and Sprite).</p>

<p>Remember when alcohol sales were banned on Election Day? Those weren’t the days. This year on November 6, The Range Kitchen &amp; Cocktails in Hillcrest will offer $5 Donkey Punch Elephant Elixirs and Red Money shots. On the menu: Swing State Sliders and Freedom Fries.</p>

<p>Top Chef Brian Malarkey’s chic downtown Searsucker restaurant is mixing up an “ever-changing, flip-flopping, but always optimistic” Pundit’s Punch, made with rum, ginger, lemon and melon (but that may be reported differently tomorrow).</p>

<p>La Jolla cupcake store Sprinkles is sweetening the city with a campaign that includes “election boxes” for their confections that read <em>Obama</em> and <em>Romney</em>.</p>

<p>Nationally, 7-Eleven is also letting its customers show their political preference – on coffee cups. When you buy a cup of Joe, there’s a red Romney cup and a blue Obama cup to choose from.</p>

<p>Undecided or unaffiliated coffee drinkers can use the green cup to carry their caffeine injections.</p>

<p>It should be noted that for the past three Presidential elections this unscientific “7-Election” poll has eerily mirrored the actual national results. As of today, Obama was leading Romney nationally by a 59 percent to 41 percent margin.</p>

<p>Obama has a 62-38 lead in California; and a 63-37 head of steam in San Diego.</p>
