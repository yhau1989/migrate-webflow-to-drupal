<p>San Diego is home to many breweries from large to small and plenty of great places to drop in and have a beer. For the past several years one has stood out personally as a blend of both that is for everyone in San Diego. <a href="http://hessbrewing.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hess Brewing</a> was San Diego’s first nano-brewery, brewing small hand-crafted batches of fifty gallons.</p>

<p><a href="http://hessbrewing.com/brewery.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hess Brewing</a> operates out of a industrial garage tucked away in Mira Mesa where the brewery has crafted all of their beer in a small space. Within the last month they have doubled their space and are working on a separate brewery in North Park.</p>

<p>Hess Brewing beers have a distinctive creamy texture and rich flavor. Make sure to try the Claritas, their Kolsch with a crisp Pilsner-malt base, lightly hopped with Noble hops. On a hot day ask one of the Mike’s to pour their honey orange wheat ale, Jucundus.</p>

<p>What makes Hess Brewing a favorite in <a href="../../../../Applications/Microsoft%20Office%202011/Microsoft%20Word.app/Contents/ivnsandiego.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego</a> is their open door on Friday afternoons. Beer fans from across San Diego are able to drop by the brewery after work for a quick beer and enjoy the food truck that is pulled up on Friday afternoons.</p>

<p>One can meet a lot of friendly people, play catch with a black lab, have a bite to eat, and enjoy some of the best beer in town.</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 20 the brewery is hosting Oktoberhess from 1-6 with music from the “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheAssPocketWhiskyFellas" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ass Pocket Whiskey Fellas</a>” an Irish traditional, country, bluegrass, and rock band along with food from Ranchwood Deli.</p>

<p>If you can’t make it this weekend drop in on Halloween from 4-8 featuring special Halloween inspired cask ale, food from Kumpir and It’s a Dog’s World, music, and costume contest.</p>
