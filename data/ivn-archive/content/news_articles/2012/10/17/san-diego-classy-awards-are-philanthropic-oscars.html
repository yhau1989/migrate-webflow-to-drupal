<p>“<em>You stay classy, San Diego....”</em> was the infamous sign-off line by comic actor Will Ferrell in the movie <em>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</em>. In real life Stay Classy is no joke - the six-year-old local company develops online fundraising products used by nonprofit organizations around the world.&nbsp; The company also recently held the "San Diego Classy Awards" at the San Diego Civic Theatre.</p>

<p>In 2006, Stay Classy founders Scot Chisholm and Pat Walsh were looking to fund raise for a charity. They couldn’t find a platform that could turn supporters into fundraisers – so they created one.</p>

<p>Today, Stay Classy’s fundraising solution is used by charities, foundations, churches, schools, clubs and others.</p>

<p>The company, which had had $250,000 in revenue last year and has helped 2,000 nonprofits raise more than $5 million, was recognized by <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> as one of “America’s Most Promising Social Entrepreneurs.”</p>

<p>Naturally, the company came up with a recognition program called The Classy Awards. Started in 2009, it’s now the largest philanthropic awards ceremony in the country – celebrating the top nonprofits, socially conscious businesses and individuals worldwide.</p>

<p>The Classy Awards are considered the Oscars of the world of philanthropy. More than 2,000 nominations were submitted last year from 49 states and more than a quarter of a million votes were cast for award finalists.</p>

<p>The awards ceremony gathers more than 1,500 philanthropic leaders to the San Diego Civic Theatre.</p>

<p>In 2012, the “Charity of the Year” was the San Diego-based Wounded Warrior Project. The winner of the “Most Effective Awareness Campaign By A Charity” went to another local organization, Invisible Children.</p>

<p>Also this year, a special video presentation by Maria Shriver paid homage to her mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics.</p>
