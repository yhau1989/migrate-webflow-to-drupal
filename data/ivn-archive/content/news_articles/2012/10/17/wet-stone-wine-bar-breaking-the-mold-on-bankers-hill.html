<p>"Wine bars" tend to have a lurking stigma: pinky fingers lilted in snarky sophistication; sniffling, snorting, and swishing around the rim of a delicate glass, and an obvious lack of substantial protein - typically substituted by insignificant amounts of fungal,aged cheese and past-due starch.&nbsp; Perhaps it depends on personal perception, but, in a city where trend-oriented wine bars rear their temporary heads, only to vanish into obscurity, it is reassuring to have a spot like <a href="http://www.wetstonewinebar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wet Stone Wine Bar</a> in the Banker's Hill area.</p>

<p>Wet Stone Wine Bar is the brainchild of Proprietor/Chef Christian Gomez.&nbsp; A native San Diegan, Gomez grew up in the Barrio Logan area in a rich and culturally diverse background.&nbsp; His father was an executive chef, and of Filipino-Spanish descent, while his mother was Panamanian-Chinese.&nbsp; This background commenced Gomez's quest for conquering world cuisine at an early age.</p>

<p>According to Gomez's <a href="http://www.wetstonewinebar.com/about.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">biography</a> , early weekend outings to Tijuana's Mercado Central was quite the norm.&nbsp; On these trips, which typically involved the whole family, Gomez was further introduced into the majesty that is the "open-air market."&nbsp; With his father being an executive chef, it was only natural for the boy to enter the industry at an early age.&nbsp; This lead to Gomez getting a job as a bus boy working at chef Tom Fat's renowned Fat City/China Camp while in his teens, of which would provide the later drive for him to open his own spot. In approaching early adulthood, Gomez took a trip to Europe to learn the "Old World" cooking methods used from Amsterdam to Paris.</p>

<p>Striking out on his own in the states, Gomez landed a gig in Los Angeles at the innovative Border Grill.&nbsp; The Border Grill was owned by Sue Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken, whose global menu and attention to presentation enthralled Gomez.&nbsp; This kick started him into an endeavor known as "food styling."</p>

<p>â€œThis was so different from my experience where preparing food meant indulging a taste. With food styling, the priority lies solely upon tantalizing the eye," says Gomez.</p>

<p>In 2005, after many attempts at pitching television shows to executives between LA and NYC, Gomez landed a job co-producing thirteen episodes of <em>Green Eats</em> for NBC-LA.&nbsp; Following a subsequent trip to Europe once more, Gomez returned to San Diego to work back and forth from LA as a private chef.</p>

<p>After spending half of his life honing his trade in Los Angeles, Gomez was ready to show his hometown's culinary scene what was up.&nbsp; The Fourth Avenue location is anything but pretentious, for it was once an old residence. A colonial-style residence where the first floor has been converted into comfortably intimate setting, with each table area a different motif.&nbsp; Dining at Wet Stone is the comparison to a private dinner at a friend's house.&nbsp; The&nbsp; menu reflects the restaurants straightforward setup, serving lunch and dinner everyday besides Monday.&nbsp; Furthermore, the food is to the point, brought tapas style, and ultimately equals out to filling meals.</p>

<p>The panini is a lunch staple at Wet Stone, with swine-enthusiasts object of affection - pork belly - as a main attraction.&nbsp; The pork belly panini ($7)&nbsp; is a&nbsp; braised "Chinese five," and is served with aioli, fennel slaw, and tangy pickled red onions.&nbsp; For a lighter lunch date, try the caprese ($8) or beet ($9) salad.&nbsp; If one is really craving something substantial for lunch, order one of Wet Stone's "small plates" (not a small portion), like the churrasco plate ($15).&nbsp; The churrasco is a mix-grilled plate of achiote chicken breast, flat-iron steak, and&nbsp; merguez lamb sausage with in-house chimichurri &amp; bleu cheese crostini.</p>

<p>Wet Stone's lunch menu transitions well into the dinner menu, as several items remain, only in slightly larger portions.&nbsp; Like any decent wine bar, Wet Stone has fruit and cheese ($14), as well as meat and cheese plates ($16).&nbsp; One major twist from a typical wine bar, however, is that Wet Stone serves flat bread pizzas from $14-$16 (seems to be a common theme).&nbsp; The four-cheese queso fundido ($10), is also great to share with the table - but the pork belly crostinis ($9) really drive it home.</p>

<p>Regarding wines, Wet Stone has a great selection of "global" and "stateside" red and whites, as well as a selection of craft beers from around the world.&nbsp; Wines on special are typically $7 a glass, and $25 for a carafe.</p>

<p>Wet Stone Wine Bar is open for lunch from 11-2pm Tuesday to Friday, open for dinner from 5-10pm Tuesday to Saturday, as well as from 4-9pm on Sunday.&nbsp; Happy hour is from 5-7pm Tuesday to Saturday, and all night on Sunday.</p>
