<p><img alt="&quot;No ketchup, mate - just eat the burger...&quot;." height="400" src="cloudinary://raglan-public-house-caters-to-yanks-no-ketchup-necessary-48597.jpg" width="600">A good burger/beer combo is not exactly a rare find in San Diego, but the places that do it right tend to build up an almost cult following. &nbsp;Throw a beach community into the mix, some New Zealand surf-shack memorabilia, a rustic indoor/outdoor dining area, plus astro-turf, and &nbsp;there is Raglan Public House in Ocean Beach.</p>
<p>"Raglan," named after a town with an infamous point break in New Zealand, opened up shop February 3 off Bacon Street in Ocean Beach. &nbsp;Closely located to the Newport Avenue business district, Raglan is a bit tucked away from the hustle and bustle. &nbsp;The business model is rather similar to Bare Back Bar and Grill in Pacific Beach, which ultimately opened the Ocean Beach location. &nbsp;What Raglan has found is obviously working, as happy hour at this place is typically standing-room only (unless you beat the crowd).</p>

<p><img alt="&quot;No ketchup, mate - just eat the burger...&quot;." height="199" src="cloudinary://raglan-public-house-caters-to-yanks-no-ketchup-necessary-95447-300x199.jpg" width="300">Fusing such Kiwi classics as "chicken on a stick" ($8.50) with endless varieties of that great American classic, the burger, Raglan utilizes 100 percent organic beef in their innovative concoctions. &nbsp;One can opt for the "bare burger" ($9), which comes complete with lettuce, tomato, red onion, garlic aioli, and is topped off with their signature house tomato chutney. &nbsp; &nbsp;The current "burger of the month" that keeps with the Oktoberfest theme, contains ground bratwurst in the patty which is delectably placed between two buns of salted pretzel euphoria ($10.90). &nbsp;Not to mention that it pairs well with a 40 ounce bucket (mug) of Trumer Pils for five bucks.</p>

<p>Down for a bit of adventure? Try the "bare 'lil lamb" ($10.90), a lamb burger dressed with bleu cheese, mint dressing, beetroot, and the basic fixings. The not-so-meat-friendly customer need not to worry, as their salads are fresh and phenomenal as well.</p>

<p>While Raglan places emphasis predominantly on local San Diego breweries like Ballast Point, Coronado, and Stone, their extensive twenty-four tap selection never fails to satisfy a hop head's thirst. &nbsp;Pints costs anywhere from $3-7, and they maintain a succinct wine selection of New Zealand and Australian wines.</p>

<p>Raglan Public House has taken a concept that is relatively simple, yet obscure, and cultivated a following throughout San Diego. &nbsp;If the Taco-Tuesday grind is not on the evening's agenda, slide into Raglan Public House for "Taco-less Tuesday," during happy hour for some miniature versions of their completely original burgers.</p>

<p><em>Raglan Public House is located at 1851 Bacon Street in Ocean Beach (619)794-2304.</em></p>
