<p>As the presidential candidates butted heads on domestic policy, those watching turned to the Internet to follow and participate in the first presidential debate. News organizations live-blogged the action, politicians hosted Google+ Hangouts, Tumblr <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCkQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fivn.us%2Fsocial-ballot%2F2012%2F10%2F03%2Ftumblr-to-live-gif-the-presidential-debates%2F&amp;ei=TLhtUOT8F8fC2wWAnoAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaDLbUjVje2Dp6JfFZAuT_bmc4aw" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-giffed</a> the debate, and voters voiced their frustrations on social networks. In a flurry of 140-character messages, people from all across the country gathered on one platform, Twitter, to discuss the 2012 election, making Twitter the clear winner of last night's debate. Generating over 10 million tweets, last night's presidential debate was the most tweeted about event in U.S. politics.</p>

<p>At around 9:34 p.m., conversation spiked around Romney's Big Bird comment, reaching 135,322 tweets per minute.&nbsp;Romney's exact quote was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><em>I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I actually like you too. But I’m not going to -- I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it. That’s number one.</em></blockquote>
<p>And then, a meme was born.</p>
