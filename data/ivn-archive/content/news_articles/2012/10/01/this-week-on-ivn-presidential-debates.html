<h3><strong>Major Developments
</strong><em>for Unfiltered News.</em></h3>
IVN is expanding its platform everyday to help bring independent contributors into the news cycle.

We've added all new ways to participate: the ability to vote on whether articles are good or bad journalism, user profiles that include points for participation, and we are set to launch the first local IVN prototype on October 17th.

This week, we are finishing our Kickstarter page, a Facebook application, and will be offering free stickers to all independent-minded voters!

Stay tuned at&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN.us</a>&nbsp;to be a part of the fastest growing political news source.
