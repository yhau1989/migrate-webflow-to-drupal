<p>People Water is a leading provider of eco-friendly products providing clean water to thousands of people globally.&nbsp; People Water provides a link between globally conscious consumers and the millions of&nbsp;people in need of clean water around the world.&nbsp; Through its drop for drop initiative, for every bottle purchased, People Water will give an equal amount of clean water to a person in need.&nbsp; This is not simply done by giving bottled water to the less fortunate, but by providing sustainable water resources.&nbsp; People Water accomplishes this goal by traveling all over the globe and digging wells that will provide entire communities with a renewable water resource.</p>

<p>The most recent example of the Drop for Drop initiative, People Water traveled to Haiti to where they fixed over 20 wells.&nbsp; On average a well delivers 1,000 liters of clean water a day.&nbsp; Based on this average, a well will meet its drop for drop commitment in around 6 months.&nbsp; People Water, by providing 20,000 liters a day is doing its part to create a better living opportunity for the people of Haiti.&nbsp; To do your part, find out how you can get more involved at <a href="http://www.peoplewater.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.peoplewater.com</a>.</p>

<p>People Water will be on sale in Southern California at the end of October.</p>
