<p><img alt="" height="325" src="cloudinary://twelve-vision-party-candidate-jill-reed-45419.jpg" title="Jill Reed for President" width="600">IVN.us is to host the first ever <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/10/11/ivn-us-to-host-first-online-presidential-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">online presidential debate</a> featuring Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green candidate Jill Stein. But IVN's phones and e-mail box were bombarded by a much lesser-known candidate: write-in candidate, Jill Reed. And her supporters made their voices heard in our office.</p>

<p>IVN.us has received a flood of pleas from members of the <a href="http://www.tvp2012.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twelve Vision Party</a>&nbsp;("TVP") and Reed supporters, asking that Reed be included in the historic online presidential debate.</p>

<p>Jill Reed is a resident of Casper, Wyoming and running as the Twelve Vision Party candidate. The Twelve Vision Party runs on a platform that advocates a “Protection-Only Government.” The TVP preamble reads:</p>
<blockquote><strong>*The purpose of human life is to prosper and live happily.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>* The function of government is to provide the conditions that let individuals fulfill that purpose.</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>* The Prime Law® guarantees those conditions by forbidding the use of initiatory force, fraud, or coercion by any person or group against any individual, property, or contract.</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>ARTICLE 1</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>No person, group of persons, or government shall initiate force, threat of force, or fraud against any individual's self, property, or contract.</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>ARTICLE 2</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>Force is morally and legally justified only for protection from those who violate Article 1.</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>ARTICLE 3</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>No exceptions shall exist for Articles 1 and 2.</strong><strong></strong></blockquote>
<p>Among those who promoted Reed’s presidential campaign and the TVP platform, there was a remarkable sense that everyday citizens are finally finding their voices and are using the opportunity to make sincere appeals to open up democracy. Of particular note was that every single e-mail message was polite.</p>

<p>One message read:</p>
<blockquote>“The two party system is broken, it cannot be fixed it has to be replaced. I would love to hear from all the independent Presidential candidates, especially Jill Reed, the only candidate with a plan to cut the national budget in half and prevent America’s fall into insolvent bankruptcy.”</blockquote>
<p>Another read:</p>
<blockquote>Thank you for this opportunity to request you to include President-Elect&nbsp;Jill&nbsp;Reed. in tonight's debate.

If you have not yet considered having her included, I can assure you that she would add the most value to whatever discussions will take place. Tomorrow, in homes, offices and workplaces wherever your audience had opportunity to watch your program, she would be the 'talk of the town', and&nbsp;Jill&nbsp;Reed's name would be on the tip of everyone's tongue from here on, thanks to your public forum.

In fact, I have every expectation that it would be a scoop of the most sublime nature. She offers an honesty and a several decades old Platform the world is waiting for and whose time is long-overdue!

I look forward to witnessing your station garnering the kudos for your conscientios vision by including her!

Love of life to us all,

<p>In addition to Reed’s interest in participating in IVN.us’ presidential debate, supporters of T.J. O’hara, Virgil Goode, and Rocky Anderson have voiced their interest in seeing each presidential candidate’s participation. The&nbsp;debate was limited to Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, because&nbsp;logistically, using technology for the first time ever becomes exponentially more difficult for each candidate added.</p>

<p>IVN will invite every campaign to participate to the greatest extent possible and practical.&nbsp;IVN has made made an <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/10/18/why-the-ivn-debate-only-includes-gary-johnson-and-jill-stein/" rel="noopener noreferrer">open invitation</a> to any two candidates to have a debate moderated by IVN. Each candidate is encouraged to find another willing and credible debate adversary and send an email to IVN.us to get it on the schedule.</p>
