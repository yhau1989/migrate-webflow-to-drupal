<p>This November Californians will have the choice to vote on <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Text_of_California_Proposition_39_(November_2012)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 39</a>. If 39 should pass, it will require that businesses with operations in multiple states pay income taxes based on a percentage of their business in California, instead of the currently permissible preferred tax calculation method. (For more on Prop 39 visit the IVN <a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/propositions/about-prop-39/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election Center</a>.)</p>

<p>Whether the proposition passes could rely heavily on the success of the "Yes" and "No" campaigns, as the intricacies of business taxes are not the average voter's expertise. Interestingly, the “<a href="http://www.cleanenergyjobsact.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes on Prop 39</a>” campaign has raised $23.128 million in contributions, with $21.9 million invested by one man, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/thomas-steyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas F. Steyer</a>. The “<a href="http://www.stop39.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">No on Prop 39</a>” campaign, on the other hand, has had no financial support.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home_usa/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes.com</a>, Steyer&nbsp;has a net worth of $1.3 billion.&nbsp;His self-made fortune began with San Francisco-based hedge fund <a href="http://www.faralloncapital.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farallon Capital Management</a>, which he founded in 1986. Since then, Steyer has become Managing Director and Member of the Investment Committee of <a href="http://www.hf.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hellman &amp; Friedman</a>, L.L.C. and has been heavily involved in both business and politics. He has also co-founded the <a href="http://www.aee.net/about-us/board-of-directors-aee-institute" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Energy Economy</a> business organization and has created the <a href="http://www.onepcf.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Pacific Coast Foundation</a> to start a community bank, <a href="http://onepacificcoastbank.com/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Pacific Coast Bank</a>.</p>

<p>Steyer argues that Prop 39 could bring $1.1 billion a year to California. The money would then be used for clean energy and other programs that will create jobs. Section 2, Division 16.3, Chapter 2 of the proposition creates the "California Clean Energy Jobs Fund," which would receive $550 million from the General fund over five fiscal years. If the Citizens Oversight Board, created by the proposition, is diligent and efficient with the funds raised and re-appropriated by Prop 39, California may see a rise in clean energy jobs.</p>

<p>California voters now have several issues to consider when deciding how to vote on Prop 39: The "Yes" campaign’s <a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/2012/10/12/california-prop-39-multistate-businesses-clean-energy-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">argument</a> for passing the proposition and the implications of Steyer’s involvement, and the "No" campaign’s counter <a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/2012/10/12/california-prop-39-multistate-businesses-clean-energy-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">argument</a>.</p>

<p>Researching the groups and individuals that fund campaigns is a helpful way to understand whose interests are involved where, and can help voters estimate the full repercussions of a given proposition.</p>
