<p>On Wednesday, October 17 the staff of Independent Voter Network (IVN) hosted the official launch of their localized San Diego platform, IVN San Diego, at <a href="http://www.co-merge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Co-Merge</a> community workspace.&nbsp; The event was well-attended, with over one hundred San Diegans stopping by for beer, wine, hors d’oeuvres, and a dose of nonpartisan news.&nbsp; Here guests were provided with insight as to what IVN was up to: bringing the platform of fair and balanced journalism to a local level.</p>

<p>IVN San Diego functions as a prototype for sites in other cities, as the main IVN site is a national nonpartisan news platform for independent voters. Through localization, the San Diego site will also cover aspects of America’s Finest City that make it unique from other cities in southern California, as well as across the nation.</p>

<p>IVN San Diego areas of coverage include: news and politics, "beer and bites," business, and life in this coastal city.</p>

<p>There could not have been a more fitting location to host the launch of such an innovative website than Co-Merge at 330 A Street downtown.&nbsp; Owned by Robert Conrad, Co-Merge is a membership based community workspace available for use by all San Diegans.&nbsp; The workspace is not only modern regarding design and technological utilities, but completely sustainable in architecture.&nbsp; &nbsp;If one is looking for an organized, quiet place to get their work done, it is highly recommended to check out Co-Merge.</p>

<p>Phenomenal sandwiches, wraps, desserts, and fruit were provided by <a href="http://www.newbreakcafe.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newbreak Café</a>, who has two locations in Ocean Beach, and one downtown.&nbsp; Keeping things truly local, <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone Brewing Company</a> supplied the beer – with choices of their original IPA and Pale Ales.</p>

<p>IVN San Diego will continue to publish nonpartisan articles written by credible journalists, all the while fostering the ideas, culture, and independent thinking that sets San Diego apart as a city.</p>
