Americans are coming together once again on a local, state, and national level to participate in an exercise of universally participatory self-government, and in many races, the peaceful transition of political power from incumbents and retiring policymakers to new officeholders.

The entire process is a marvel of modern society and political economy. For over two hundred years, America's form of government has been one of the great foundations of its strength and prosperity, as well as the envy and talk of the world, inspiring similar government all over the globe, while inviting millions to move here and call America home. This week, IVN presents: "Democracy in America!"
