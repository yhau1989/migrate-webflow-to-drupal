<p>Mayor Jerry Sanders announced today that <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comic-Con International</a> would be extending its contract with the City of San Diego.&nbsp; The original contract was set to expire in 2015, but the representatives at Comic-Con look to host the event in the city until 2016.</p>
<p>Mayor Sanders said that the festival, held at the <a href="http://www.visitsandiego.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Convention Center</a>, draws around 130,000 visitors each year.&nbsp; The event boosts the local economy to the tune of more than $180 million.&nbsp; This is a big deal for the city as a whole, being that that is obviously a great deal of revenue.&nbsp; There was some concern, on behalf of the city, that the Comic-Con crowd would soon far exceed the capacity of the San Diego Convention Center.&nbsp; This being the case, it was a possibility that the organizers of the event look to larger venues in Los Angeles to support the event.</p>

<p>Comic-Con representatives and city officials extended the agreement in a decision to create a "Comic-Con campus," expanding the event around the city as to accommodate the growing attendance.</p>

<p>The event, for those who may not know, was birthed in San Diego in 1970, and has continued to return to the city over the past four decades.&nbsp; Comic-Con is a popular-culture convention celebrating all things science-fiction, video game, comic artist, and, of course, Stark Trek and Star Wars related.&nbsp; This past Comic-Con was held at the San Diego Convention Center from July 12-15, and was widely publicized, well-attended, and pushed some serious capital into the city's economy.</p>

<p>According to comic-con.org, the 2013 Comic-Con International:San Diego will be held on July 18-21.&nbsp; So far, the event will take place in eighteen different rooms of the Convention Center, which range from 280 seats per room, to the massive, 6,500 seat Hall H.&nbsp; As a result of expansion, the upcoming Comic-Con will further utilize satellite areas, such as hotels and other local businesses.</p>

<p>Although seemingly a year extension to a contract, the Comic-Con festival is an event that generates a lot of money for the city.&nbsp; Had the agreement to expand the event not been made, the extension may have not been a possibility.</p>
