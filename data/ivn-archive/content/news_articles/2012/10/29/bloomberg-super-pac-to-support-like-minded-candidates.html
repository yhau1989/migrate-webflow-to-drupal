<p>The Mike Bloomberg Super PAC, Independence USA PAC, expects to spend $10 to $15 million dollars to back selected candidates and legislation across the country.</p>

<p>The PAC pledges to support non-partisan candidates, LGBT rights, gun control, and education efforts which are important issues to Bloomberg.</p>

<p>“I’ve always believed in the need for more independent leadership, and this new effort will support candidates and causes that will help protect Americans from the scourge of gun violence, improve our schools, and advance our freedoms,” he said in a statement to the <a href="http://www.pe.com/local-news/politics/ben-goad-headlines/20121019-2012-election-n.y.s-bloomberg-eyes-inland-house-race.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer">press.</a></p>

<p>Gloria Negrete-Mcleod, Dan Maffei,&nbsp;Robert Dold,Val Demings,&nbsp;Ann Marie&nbsp;Buerkle and&nbsp;Daniel Webster&nbsp;are the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/indexpend.php?strID=C00532705&amp;cycle=2012%20super" rel="noopener noreferrer">current known recipients</a>&nbsp;of the PAC. The funding for&nbsp;Buerkle and Webster has been focused against rather than in support like the other four.&nbsp;Bloomberg, whose net worth is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated at $25 billion</a>, has spent $838,235&nbsp;thus far between the six candidates. A <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=700D96FE-C29C-7CA2-F41D7AAAB5FCBD58" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> from the office of Mayor Bloomberg&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that this PAC is the largest effort to date by Mayor Bloomberg to impact races and referenda across the country.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/nyregion/bloomberg-forming-super-pac-to-influence-2012-races.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times also reported</a> that&nbsp;Gov. Angus King, an independent running for the United States Senate in Maine will be a recipient as well.</p>

<p>"It's critically important that we have elected officials in Washington, Albany, and around the nation who are willing to work across party lines to achieve real results," Mayor Bloomberg said in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=700D96FE-C29C-7CA2-F41D7AAAB5FCBD58" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>.</p>

<p>According to the<a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=700D96FE-C29C-7CA2-F41D7AAAB5FCBD58" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;release</a>, Howard Wolfson will oversee the efforts of the PAC.&nbsp;“The Mayor has always stepped forward to back candidates that are willing to cast aside party politics, and candidates who are willing to stand up to special interests to make the right decisions for the people they represent,” Wolfson said.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/ci_21847401/election-2012-michael-bloomberg-pac-buys-mailer-supporting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Bulletin reported</a> that Bloomberg chose to support McLeod in the democrat versus democrat race for California's 35th Congressional district against Rep. Joe Baca. Independence USA PAC has allotted&nbsp;$195,424 to McLeod, the largest sum in support of a candidate.</p>

<p>McLeod identifies <a href="http://negretemcleod.com/index.php?page=display&amp;id=124" rel="noopener noreferrer">her priorities</a> as&nbsp;job creation and ensuring limited resources are invested in programs that improve the lives of Californians.&nbsp;<a href="http://baca.house.gov/biography/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baca says</a> his focus has been on&nbsp;issues that impact the poor and underserved such as nutrition, housing, health, veterans’ affairs, and issues affecting the Hispanic and Native American communities.&nbsp;While Baca has the experience being a member of Congress since 1999, Bloomberg is looking for candidates that share his ideals.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nrapvf.org/grades-endorsements/2012/california.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Rifle Association</a>&nbsp;rated McLeod a "D" on gun policy and Baca recieved a "B+" showing that McLeod better reflects Bloomberg's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=BF28B050-C29C-7CA2-F414FC3F9EC99945" rel="noopener noreferrer">stance on the issue</a>. This is an important issue for Bloomberg and is speculated to be why he chose to support McLeod on her first shot at a congressional seat.</p>

<p>McLeod has also shown a commitment to the Independent agenda stating, "My record of independent, common sense leadership has earned me the support of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats throughout the district." As an outspoken Independent, Bloomberg is supporting candidates who he deems non-partisan and opposing those he sees as threat.</p>

<p>The Bloomberg Super PAC hopes to influence undecided voters within the last week before elections.</p>
