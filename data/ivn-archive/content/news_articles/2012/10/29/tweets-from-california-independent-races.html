<p>There are five races in California that will see a candidate that is running without any party affiliation. All but one of these races are in districts that put a partisan incumbent against a non-partisan who have not previously held office, yet the numbers in the primary election were particularly close between each district's candidates. In District 29, Los Angeles Democratic City Council member <a href="http://ivn.us/find-candidates/?source=http%3A%2F%2Fvote-ca.org%2FIntro.aspx%3FState%3DCA%26Id%3DCACardenasTony" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Cardenas</a> faces non-partisan independent candidate and community activist <a href="http://ivn.us/find-candidates/?source=http%3A%2F%2Fvote-ca.org%2FIntro.aspx%3FState%3DCA%26Id%3DCAHernandezDavidR" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Hernandez</a>.</p>

<p>Social media participation, through outlets like Twitter, in these highly competitive races, has been an effective way for candidates to reach out to their constituents. David Hernandez (NPP) even has a smartphone app on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app_dist29.layout&amp;hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/david-hernandez-voice-district/id561540967?mt=8" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple App</a> stores that provides his supporters with his campaign calendar and easy access to his Twitter feed and Facebook page.</p>

<p>The Hernandez/Cardenas race in Congressional District 29, from a Twitter supporters standpoint will be particularly interesting. If a win was given on the criteria of followers alone, Hernandez would win with 607 followers against Cardenas's 24 followers.</p>

<p>The following is a list of legislative districts that have a independent non-partisan candidate running.</p>
