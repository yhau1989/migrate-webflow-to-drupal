<p>Third party candidates in this presidential election often mention the drug war as the example of failed policy agreed on by the two main parties. The legalization of&nbsp;marijuana is one of the main changes advocated for by these candidates . However, nobody addresses &nbsp;the link between HIV and the drug war.</p>

<p>1/3 of all Aids cases in the US have been caused by&nbsp;syringe sharing. Syringe access programs have reduced the HIV incidence among users by 80%. However, the Congress have had a long standing ban of the use of federal funding to support these programs. Today 17 states still have no legal syringe access programs.</p>

<p>The following infographic, created by the<a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Drug Policy&nbsp;Alliance</a>, illustrate how the drug war is detrimental to the fight&nbsp;against the HIV&nbsp;epidemic&nbsp;in the US.</p>
