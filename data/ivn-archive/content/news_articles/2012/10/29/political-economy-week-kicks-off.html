<p>From Political Economy Week's schedule, we can see that the Grossmont faculty covering a wide-range of topics. Instructors and notable guest presenters do their best to objectively present the issues while offering several opinions.</p>

<p>Dr. Todd Myers, a professor and participant of Political Economy Week, told us why the public should consider attending a presentation:</p>
<blockquote>"The events are open to the community as part of the public mission of the community colleges to create a better informed citizenry. Anyone who loves politics and wants to get a little deeper than the surface would benefit by stopping by Grossmont during Political Economy Week."</blockquote>

<p>San Diego County Board of Education candidate <a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/06/05/ca/sd/vote/robinson_g/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregg Robinson</a> will be participating. On Wednesday, he will be covering the health care market with fellow instructor Scott McGann. Gregg Robinson is a professor of sociology at Grossmont College. He holds a Ph.D in Sociology of Education from UC San Diego and is a long-time political activist.</p>

<p>The Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District (GCCCD) has <a href="http://www.gcccd.edu/advancement-communications/proposition-v/propvfaq.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition V</a> on the ballot this election. It is a $398 million bond measure to help with the campuses' technology and infrastructure. East County voters will be deciding on the bond measure as it will affect their property taxes. Since Political Economy Week takes place on Grossmont's campus, Proposition V could be used to help take the event further in its recognition and professionalism.</p>

<p>Grossmont College is located on 8800 Grossmont College Drive in El Cajon.</p>
