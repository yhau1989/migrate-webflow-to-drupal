<p><img alt="" height="350" src="cloudinary://romney-from-crusader-for-renewables-to-champion-of-fossil-fuels-58755.jpg" title="Renewables to Fossil Fuel IVN" width="600">A key part of Romney’s job plan involves rapid expansion of oil, natural gas, and coal.&nbsp; As he said on one occasion, “I like coal.” On the other hand, he opposes current financial supports for renewable energy, such as the tax credit for wind energy.&nbsp; He has accused Obama of focusing on “an imaginary world where government-subsidized windmills and solar panels could power the economy.”&nbsp; Not only does he want to produce more fossil fuels, but he wants to eliminate barriers to their use such as the Obama administration’s new air pollution regulations.&nbsp; And he opposes regulation of greenhouse gases and rejects any possibility of a cap and trade system.</p>

<p>None of this should surprise anyone who has paid even minimal attention to the campaign.&nbsp; But what may be more surprising is that these positions are the exact opposite of Romney’s positions a dozen years ago.&nbsp; As shown by reports in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/us/politics/romney-energy-agenda-shifted.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-11/romney-helped-spark-green-energy-boom-in-massachusetts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-11/romney-helped-spark-green-energy-boom-in-massachusetts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, Romney was on a different kind of crusade when he was governor.&nbsp; Rather than being an advocate of fossil fuels, he supported cap-and-trade and air pollution regulations similar to Obama’s.&nbsp; Rather than being opposed to subsidies for clean energy, he helped create them.&nbsp; It’s a remarkable evolution over the course of little more than a decade.&nbsp; The policies he hammers today are the policies he supported back then.</p>

<p>In contrast to his current views, Romney prioritized environmental protection over fossil fuel use when he was governor.&nbsp; In demanding the closure of a coal plant with a bad pollution record, he said: “I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people.&nbsp; And that plant, that plant kills people.”&nbsp; He set tough new standards limiting mercury emissions from power plants, just as the Obama Administration has now done.&nbsp; And he helped negotiate a cap-and-trade system for the Northeastern states, pulling out at the last minute only because the plan did not include a price ceiling.</p>

<p>In terms of renewable energy, again his views then were the opposite of his views now.&nbsp; When he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney promoted the state’s green energy fund as a “major economic springboard.”&nbsp; The fund was selective, picking companies based on their potential.&nbsp; Like Solyndra today, some of the companies went bust.</p>

<p>Just how far Romney has traveled in the past dozen years was clear in the last presidential debate.&nbsp; He upbraided the Administration for rising gas prices and chided Obama’s Secretary of Energy for saying that low gas prices weren’t his department’s mission.&nbsp; But back when he was governor, he told an advisor that “we’d be a lot better off in this country if we had European gas prices” because this would force Americans to buy more energy-efficient cars.&nbsp; Today, not only does he oppose high gas prices, but he also opposes federal fuel efficiency standards for cars.</p>

<p>In reality, Obama’s policies today are very much like Romney’s policies as governor. We can only speculate about the reasons for Romney’s about-face on energy issues.&nbsp; Maybe he considered his Massachusetts policies to be terrible failures, or maybe he thinks that circumstances have completely changed in the last dozen years.&nbsp; Or maybe it’s just politics.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, his switch on energy issues shows an unusual degree of flux in Romney’s policy commitments. Whether this exceptional flexibility is a good thing or a bad thing is up to the voters to decide.</p>
