<p><img alt="" height="376" src="cloudinary://Gary-Johnson-Crowd-Surfing.png" title="Gary Johnson Crowd Surfing" width="600">While Obama and Romney are preparing for a debate in which they won't let the former New Mexico Governor participate, the Libertarian Presidential Candidate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a> was holding an "<a href="http://www.vokle.com/events/74213-gary-johnson-ron-paul-revolutionary" rel="noopener noreferrer">online town hall</a>" in Utah for anyone who wanted to participate; literally everyone in the world.</p>

<p>And while Johnson has taken his candidacy seriously by <a href="http://ivn.us/common-sense/2012/09/23/gary-johnson-files-anti-trust-lawsuit-for-entry-to-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filing both a novel anti-trust lawsuit</a> against the Commission on Presidential Debates and for&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/09/28/gary-johnson-suing-fec-following-anti-trust-suit-filed-last-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an injunction against the FEC</a>, it was all fun and games when Gary Johnson went crowd surfing with hundreds of supporters.</p>
<h4>Watch Gary Johnson Crowd Surfing:</h4>


<p>Some on-the-ground reporting from the <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/257215/gary-johnson-just-crowd-surfed-at-the-end-of-his-town-hall-not-joking" rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyPaul</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The last question at his town hall was "if we promise not to drop you will you crowd surf". When the question was asked I thought it was ludicrous. But GJ went ahead and did it. After thinking about it for a second, I saw the brilliance in it. Maybe it will go viral and get him some more name recognition. I'm sure someone will come up w/ a clever nickname and, again, hopefully he'll get a lot more recognition as a result.
