<p>While most news sources, <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/10/03/watch-the-presidential-debate-on-ivn-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN included</a>, will be live-blogging the debate, the staff at Tumblr will be hard at work, creating animated gifs highlighting the best and worst moments of tonight's debate. In a blog post from the staff, Tumblr writes:</p>
<blockquote><em>Elevating the discourse as only Tumblr can, weâ€™ll have a crack team of GIF artists cranking out instant animations of the best debate moments, from zingers to gaffes to awkward silences.</em></blockquote>
<p>Coverage of the debate via gif will start at 9pm EST (6pm PST) and can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://gifwich.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. To get the full story behind each gif, you can follow <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-elections-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> liveblog at the <em>Guardian</em>.
