<p>Many Americans are wondering where they can watch the presidential debate if they cannot get to a TV. Google will be streaming the debate live on YouTube and we will embed the video on this page. The debate begins at 6pm PST/9pm EST and will cover multiple topics including: the economy, healthcare, governing, and the role of government. The IVN.us team will be joining a Google+ Hangout on our <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101219378970530930435/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google+ page</a> that we ask you to join. We will be taking questions on Twitter and Google+, send yours in with the hashtag #indyvote and we will respond quickly.</p>
