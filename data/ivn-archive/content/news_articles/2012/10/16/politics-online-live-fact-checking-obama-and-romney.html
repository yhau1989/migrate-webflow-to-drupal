<p>As we prepare for the second presidential debate of the 2012 election season, we become aware of the vast array of tools made available because of the Internet. From live streaming to live fact checking, this election has highlighted the power of politics online and the internet's ability to provide voters with endless streams of information.</p>

<p>Viewers are no longer just watching the debate, rather they are sharing information on social media, smart phones in hand. While President Obama and Governor Romney spar in a town hall style debate, answering questions from both the moderator Candy Crowley and the audience on domestic and foreign policy, voters will be checking the facts live, online.</p>

A poll conducted by Global Strategy Group and Public Opinion Strategies cites:</p>
<blockquote>Fully 64% of voters use the Internet to verify or “fact check” a claim made by a candidate, including 34% who do so weekly, and 58% search for information online about candidates’ voting records or positions on the issues, including more than a quarter (26%) who do so weekly.</blockquote>
