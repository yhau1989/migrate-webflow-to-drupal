<p>With election day falling on Tuesday, November 6, the last day to register to vote in California is Monday, October 22. &nbsp;This being said, San Diegans have several options regarding where/how to register for this election whether they are voting in person locally, or casting their ballot by any other means of voting.</p>

<p>If one decides to register as a San Diego County resident, they can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>register online at <a href="https://rtv.sos.ca.gov/elections/register-to-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California's governmental website&nbsp;</a>on or before October 22;</li>
	<li>pick up a hard copy of a registration form from state sanctioned buildings (public libraries, post offices, and other government buildings) - then mail it in to county Registrar of Voters;</li>
	<li>or print an online registration form from the <a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/register-to-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">registration section</a> of the California Government site; then send in registration form by "snail mail" to state or county election officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Voters who wish to register to vote in another county in California&nbsp;must complete the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/vote-by-mail/pdf/fill-in-vote-by-mail-app-instruct.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">fill - in vote by mail application</a>,&nbsp;along with their county's ballot for the ability to vote by mail.</p>

<p>In order to register to vote in another state besides California, voters should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adhere to voter registration requirements in their state, providing necessary documents to ensure registration.</li>
	<li>Get online at &nbsp;<a href="http://www.rockthevote.com/election-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock The Vote</a> to find out registration requirements in the a given state, which is <a href="http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_voter_registration.html?source=rtv.com-homegraphic" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a> of many sites to provide such information.</li>
	<li>If voting absentee, make sure to have their vote arrive on or before Election Day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the voter registration process varies from state to state, it is necessary for a voter to register prior to their state's set deadline.</p>

<p>These election results will ultimately have major implications for San Diegans, as well as all United States citizens. &nbsp;Although most registration deadlines for individual states have passed, it is still physically plausible to register to vote in California - granted it is in a timely fashion before October 22.</p>

<p><em>Any further questions regarding "late" voter registration can be directed to the Registrar of Voters at</em> &nbsp;858.565.5800.</p>
