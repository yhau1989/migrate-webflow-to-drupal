<p>You can participate in this historic experience simply by going to <a href="http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/internet-voting.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">the city’s website </a>&nbsp;and clicking on “Registration.”&nbsp; Type in, and make a note of, your password. You can enter any old address, but use this Postal Code: T5A 0A1. Then when you are asked for your ID, click on “Other document.” They will send you your Voter’s PIN in a couple of days. (Giving false registration info is NOT a crime for this contest.)</p>



<p>The Voter Registration System will be open until Thursday, November 1, 2012. Voting will begin on Monday October 22, 2012, and be open 24/7 until November 2d.</p>



<p>Vote for your favorite color jellybean: Black, Green, Red, or Yellow</p>



<p>If you take their survey after you vote, you’ll be entered in a drawing for $500 credit on your Master Card.</p>



<p>Be Bold – try it! We’ll be doing it in the USA someday!</p>
