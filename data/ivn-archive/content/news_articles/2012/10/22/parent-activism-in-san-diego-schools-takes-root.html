<p>A movement began at a kitchen table in San Diego.</p>

<p>Soon, a handful of PTA moms and dads became a grassroots faction and founded a nonprofit called San Diego United Parent for Education, or <a href="http://www.upfored.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">UPforEd</a>. Parent activism in San Diego schools is&nbsp;uprooting and challenging the status quo in California's second largest school district.</p>

<p>"I had no idea that suggesting parents take an interest in education was radical, but I'm cool with that so long as it means I'm fighting for my kids," said Teresa Drew, Treasurer. She founded the organization with UPforEd Director of Development, Shelli Kurth.</p>

<p>About 7,000 teachers instruct 135,000 students, where the <a href="https://www.sandi.net/Page/29662" rel="noopener noreferrer">continuing achievement gap</a> still produces a sizable <a href="http://star.cde.ca.gov/star2012/ViewReport.aspx?ps=true&amp;lstTestYear=2012&amp;lstTestType=C&amp;lstCounty=37&amp;lstDistrict=68338-000&amp;lstSchool=&amp;lstGroup=1&amp;lstSubGroup=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">population of students exiting</a> high school without the 21<sup>st</sup> century skills needed to be successful citizens.</p>

<p>"We'd sit in hours-long board meetings on budgets and policies that sometimes went to votes without talking about the effect on student achievement," said Executive Director Lisa Berlanga of UPforEd. "That seemed like an incredible hole in the narrative when, nationwide, we're talking about how to improve public education."</p>

<p>The beleaguered school district faced possible <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/data-drive/article_990feeb0-f6cf-11e0-abf7-001cc4c002e0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">insolvency and state take over</a> before finally approving a $1.8 billion budget for the 2012-13 fiscal year. District officials still project a budget shortfall next year estimated at $98.4 million.</p>

<p>At such a crucial crossroads, Berlanga said the organization felt it was time to push parents to join the fight and transform San Diego Unified into a world-class public education system.</p>

<p>"UPforEd believes every child deserves a high-quality education and that parents are the stakeholders representing the most important element in public schools - our children," Berlanga said. "By uniting parent voices, we ensure that the needs of students are the priority in decision making."</p>
