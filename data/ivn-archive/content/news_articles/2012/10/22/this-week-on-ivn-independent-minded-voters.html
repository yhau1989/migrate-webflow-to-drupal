After holding its first non-partisan open primary this June, California went from the least&nbsp;competitive,&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/?wysijap=subscriptions-4&amp;email_id=21&amp;user_id=0&amp;demo=1&amp;urlpassed=aHR0cDovL2l2bi51cy9lZGl0b3JzLWJsb2cvMjAxMi8wOS8xNC9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXdpdGgtbW9zdC1jb21wZXRpdGl2ZS1lbGVjdGlvbnMtaW4tY291bnRyeS8%2FdXRtX3NvdXJjZT13eXNpamEmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249SVZOX05ld3NsZXR0ZXJfX09jdG9iZXJfMjJfXzIwMTI%3D&amp;controller=stats&amp;action=analyse&amp;wysija-page=1&amp;wysijap=subscriptions-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">to the most competitive</a>&nbsp;elections in the country, according to Ballotpedia. Arizona has a&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/?wysijap=subscriptions-4&amp;email_id=21&amp;user_id=0&amp;demo=1&amp;urlpassed=aHR0cDovL2l2bi51cy9vcGVucHJpbWFyaWVzLzIwMTIvMTAvMDkvaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQtc3VydmV5LXN0cm9uZy1zdXBwb3J0LWZvci1vcGVuLXByaW1hcnktaW4tYXJpem9uYS8%2FdXRtX3NvdXJjZT13eXNpamEmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249SVZOX05ld3NsZXR0ZXJfX09jdG9iZXJfMjJfXzIwMTI%3D&amp;controller=stats&amp;action=analyse&amp;wysija-page=1&amp;wysijap=subscriptions-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar measure</a>&nbsp;on its ballot that would end party-controlled primaries.

As the 2012 General Election approaches, IVN will pay special attention to the numerous incumbent partisans in California who face serious challenge for the first time, the state of Arizona's open elections initiative, and other races across the country where independent-minded voters are challenging the partisanship that pervades our politics.

It is two weeks away from California's first full top two runoff election under its new open primary system and the Golden State's new method for electing its lawmakers has created a drastically different political landscape.

For evidence, observers need to look no further than California's 2012 elections for the US House of Representatives, where at least five incumbent partisans are facing serious competition.
