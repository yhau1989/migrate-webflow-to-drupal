<p>Tonight President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will have one last opportunity to&nbsp;address&nbsp;voters directly in the last of the 3 presidential debates. &nbsp;It will be the last major event before Election Day on&nbsp;November 6th and will initiate the final sprint for the Holy Grail: the Presidency of the United States.</p>

<p>The election process has already been going on for a long time, starting in Iowa in January, and will only be fully completed when the elected president takes office in January 20th, 2013.&nbsp;If you are not&nbsp;completely familiar with the whole process of how the President of the United States is elected, the following&nbsp;infographic, made by&nbsp;<a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/08/27/how-united-states-presidential-election-works/dntc" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Endowment</a>, will help clarify this unique but sometime confusing process.</p>
