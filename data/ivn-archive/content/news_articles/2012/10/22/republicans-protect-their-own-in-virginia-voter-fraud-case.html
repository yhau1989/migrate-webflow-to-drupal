<p><a href="http://ivn.us/tomorrows-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomorrow’s Democracy</a> has covered the issue of voter fraud extensively in its argument for implementing a national online voting system. The central argument against an online voting system is the assumed risk of <a href="http://ivn.us/tomorrows-democracy/2012/09/28/best-arguments-against-online-voting-systems/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter fraud</a>. Aside from the lack of factual information to support the argument, another wrench is thrown into the system when voter fraud presents itself and goes unpunished.</p>



<p>Voter registration is the main area where voter fraud can occur. Individuals, political groups, and clerks all have access to voter registration info and could be implicated in perpetuating <a href="http://ivn.us/tomorrows-democracy/2012/08/29/voter-id-and-voter-fraud-do-not-compare/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter fraud</a>.</p>



<p>Recently a Republican contractor who was hired by the Republican Party of Virginia to conduct voter registration drives was implicated in a <a href="http://ivn.us/tomorrows-democracy/2012/08/27/are-incidents-of-voter-fraud-criminal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter fraud</a> scheme. Colin Small, was charged with voter fraud crimes after state investigators found as many as nine voter registration applications were found in a trash bin behind a store.</p>



<p>The chair of the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus pushed for the Virginia Attorney General to investigate the case. The Republican Attorney General has <a href="http://wtvr.com/2012/10/20/attorney-general-wont-investigate-worker-arrested-for-dumping-voter-registrations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused</a> to investigate after the State Board of Elections failed to call for an investigation.</p>



<p>The head of the State Board of Elections, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jun/22/hager-judd-leading-to-replace-gillespie/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Judd</a>, also happens to be a Republican official and former executive director of the Virginia Republican Party.</p>



<p>Brandi Lilly, Virginia Registrar has defended the decision by stating. “there’s no way to tell by party when people fill out these forms, what party they’re affiliated with, so I don’t think there’s any political motivation.”</p>



<p>With all due respect to Miss Lilly, the old idiom, if it looks like a duck, and walks like a duck, it’s a duck should apply here. This is clearly a partisan battle, but it is coming at the expense of Virginia citizens and those who are pushing for a factual discussion on voter fraud.</p>



<p>Two Republican leaders are lining up to protect one of their own who has made headlines, perpetuated voter fraud, and is now walking away scot-free.</p>
