<p>Prop 34 seeks to change the manner in which the state of California handles death penalty convictions in the state. Prop 34, if passed, would apply retroactively to inmates currently on death row. Also, Prop 34 would replace death sentences with lifetime sentences for the most serious offenders in California.</p>
