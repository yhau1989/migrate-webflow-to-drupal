[caption id="attachment_53897" align="aligncenter" width="600"] The Cost of Campaigning, as reported by the Center for Responsive Politics[/caption]<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cost-of-Campaigning.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Cost of Campaigning" height="328" src="cloudinary://Cost-of-Campaigning.jpg" title="Cost of Campaigning" width="600"></a></p>

<p>In an attempt to earn the highest office of the United States of America, both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have set records in spending, with the cost of campaigning skyrocketing daily.</p>

<p>As the presidential candidates talk about solutions, there is a void in policy making, replaced instead by campaign rhetoric, and above all, campaign fundraising. Projected by the Center for Responsive Politics, fundraising and campaign costs for the 2012 presidential race will top $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>That's just the presidential race. Total, the Presidential and Congressional races, political party costs, and outside money will total a whopping $5.8 billion. CNBC did the math, and the projected cost of campaigning for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney equals a combined <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49550998" rel="noopener noreferrer">$26.86 every second this election cycle</a>&nbsp;-- that's more than three times the federal minimum wage per hour, current set at $7.25.</p>

<p>In a time of economic recovery, the excessive waste associated with these costs is troubling.&nbsp;Putting these numbers into perspective,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mdgadvertising.com/election2012/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDG Advertising</a>&nbsp;has created an interactive infographic that begs that question: How else could that money have been spent?</p>

<p><em>"<a href="http://www.mdgadvertising.com/election2012/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dollars and Senselessness of Political Campaigning</a>‚Äù</em> outlines the ways in which campaign cash could have been spent if resources were funneled towards one of six categories: small business, education, family living, health, housing, or fun. Lastly, their interactive infographic gives users the opportunity to decide where the 5.8 billion election dollars would be better spent.</p>

	<li>139,178 people being hired.</li>
	<li>The staff of at least 275 "small" businesses.</li>
	<li>193,333 small businesses being started from scratch - it would be equal to the first-round funding for 58,000 Googles, 23,200 Apples, and 11,600 Facebooks.</li>

<p>And while the candidates debate about "Obamacare,"</p>
