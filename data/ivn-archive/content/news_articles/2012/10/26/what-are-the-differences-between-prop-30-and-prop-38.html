<p>California's education system will be at the center of the November election as two propositions are&nbsp;addressing the issue of the school funding.</p>

<p>On the one hand you have proposition 30, supported by Governor Brown, will&nbsp;increase&nbsp;funding for schools through two key fundraising provisions: a raise of the state sales tax&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as an increase of the income tax of the three highest income brackets.</p>

<p>On the other hand you have proposition 38, supported by millionaire Molly Munger, will also raise the funding for school but&nbsp;through&nbsp;a different fiscal scheme. The proposition will create a graduated income tax increase for a 12 year period that will be applicable to most income brackets.</p>

<p>Beyond these main differences, many other parts of the propositions&nbsp;differ. The following infographic, provided for <a href="http://www.edsource.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdSource</a>, will help you understand how the two proposition interact with each other and help you make up you mind.</p>
