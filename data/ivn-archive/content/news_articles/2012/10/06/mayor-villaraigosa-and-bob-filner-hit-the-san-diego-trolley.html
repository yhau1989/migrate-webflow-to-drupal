<p><img alt="" height="350" src="cloudinary://mayor-villaraigosa-and-bob-filner-hit-the-san-diego-trolley-51488.jpg" width="600">Mayor Villaraigosa, this year's Chairman at the Democratic National Convention, took a break from the Obama campaign trail this weekend to visit San Diego and campaign on behalf of Congressman Bob Filner. The two met up with a small gathering of supporters at <a href="http://www.welcometosandiego.com/san-diego-neighborhoods/condos-for-sale-downtown-san-diego/core/smart-corner-san-diego/#img0" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Corner</a> in downtown, then jumped on the Trolley to speak with voters on the way to a press conference held at an old progressive hosting ground, El Fandango, in historic San Diego's Old Town.</p>

<p>Some trolley-goers seemed &nbsp;unimpressed by the small cadre that temporarily stole the attention. &nbsp;Others were excited to meet the Los Angeles Mayor and sitting Congressman who were willing to shake a few hands and answer one-on-one questions.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="200" src="cloudinary://mayor-villaraigosa-and-bob-filner-hit-the-san-diego-trolley-78363.jpg" width="300">An elderly woman on the trolley, who seemed content in observation, answered a few questions when prodded. She said that she was a teacher for many years, and her biggest concern is the talk about wipping out her pension. She made it a point to say that she doesn't follow politics as close as she used to, because substance is rarely discussed. And while she assumes Filner would do a better job of protecting her pension, she was not aware of either candidates' plan to come to a practical agreement on how to handle the situation. Another passenger, a disabled ticket-salesman who has worked at San Diego's famous Sea World for six years, was unfazed by the candidate and the Democratic figurehead joining his daily commute.</p>

<p>When the trolley stopped in Old Town, the Congressman and Mayor&nbsp;shook&nbsp;hands with few more lively folks who were a bit more excited to see them. Waiting at El Fandego was a crowd of about 75 people, which included former Assemblyman <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/law/academics/faculty/bio.php?id=935" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Wayne</a>, Southwestern College Board Member <a href="http://www.humbertoperaza.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humberto Peraza Jr</a>., and Christopher Yanov, founder of <a href="http://realitychangers.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Changers</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="200" src="cloudinary://mayor-villaraigosa-and-bob-filner-hit-the-san-diego-trolley-69413.jpg" width="300">Filner and&nbsp;Villaraigosa took turns at the podium, addressing the crowd and the cameras on the importance of the election. They&nbsp;described&nbsp;San Diego as a place that is ready for a more progressive Mayor and forward looking financial plan.&nbsp;Villaraigosa talked about his <a href="http://www.metro.net/projects/30-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-in-10 initiative</a>&nbsp;in Los Angeles that has spurred development in his city. 30-in-10 refers to the goal of accomplishing city development projects that would traditionally take 30 years in just 10. Filner joked that he wanted to implement a 40-in-10 plan, but couldn't resist the opportunity to take a jab at the "tea partiers" and others as the source of gridlock and&nbsp;disfunction that have prevented such lofty goals.</p>

<p>Neither Filner or Villaraigosa addressed independent-minded voters directly, but they both referred to a need for a better sense of cross-community cooperation and the belief that goals are better accomplished when resources, both financial and metaphorical, are directed in a common pursuit.</p>
