<p>Republican Justin Amash has taken the Michigan contest for the newly redrawn 3rd Congressional District to the airwaves, as his opponent, Democrat Steve Pestka, gained ground.</p>

<p>Justin Amash was elected in 2010 as one of the youngest members of Congress, at age 30. His libertarian leanings also made him one of the rare Republicans <a href="http://ivn.us/common-sense/2012/08/13/rep-justin-amash-endorsement-ron-paul-2012-stands/" rel="noopener noreferrer">to endorse Ron Paul</a> in his 2012 bid for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>

<p>Amash&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G10/MI" rel="noopener noreferrer">won his district with 59.7%</a> of the votes in the last election, but the district was redrawn in 2010 and is now less favorable to Republican candidates, making this election a very tight race.</p>

<p>Justin Amash has a major advantage on the social media front. The 32 year old made himself known for his transparency on Facebook, reporting each vote he made in Congress. &nbsp;He amassed a solid following of 35,000 on Facebook and 11,000 on Twitter. Opponent Steve Pestka, on the other hand, has waged a more classic political campaign. The 62 year old has been less savvy on social media outlets, with only 7,000 Facebook fans and 259 Twitter followers.</p>

<p>Recent polls show that TV remains an absolutely essential media outlet for candidates, even in the internet golden age. The <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/ron-paul-supporter-amash-trails-poll" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest polls</a> show the two candidates in a dead heat, with&nbsp;Steve Pestka barely leading at 34.9 percent, compared to Amash's 33.8 percent and, 28.5 percent of voters undecided. This poll has been contested by Amash, who claims to have a 14 point lead according to a poll commended by his campaign.</p>

<p>Steve Petska has recently injected $1 million into his campaign, allowing him to flood West Michigan air waves with campaign ads. This has led to a surge in support for Petska. His campaign spent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/10/steve_pestka_has_flooded_west.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$410,860 giving him 977 spots</a> on local stations.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;Justin Amash only began advertising&nbsp;on TV last week and spent<a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/10/steve_pestka_has_flooded_west.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;$58,250 for 93 spots</a>.</p>

<p>Justin Amash is currently&nbsp;concentrating&nbsp;his energy on getting an advantage on the air. His campaign website is asking for his supporters to buy him TV ads, with the objective of raising $100,000 before election day. He also has more cash on hand than his opponent, which could give him an edge in the last days of campaigning.</p>

<p>This race is an example of how politicians are having to adapt to an eligible voter base that now spans&nbsp;millennials&nbsp;and retirees; one must be strong on social media, yet remain deeply rooted in television and traditional forms of media.</p>
