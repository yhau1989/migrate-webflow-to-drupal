<p>Superior Court elections are of the utmost importance in San Diego, despite the fact that judicial races do not focus on specific issues or positions, and in which candidates are nonpartisan. &nbsp;Superior Court judges are elected by each county's voters to six-year terms, and attorneys are allowed to run against sitting Superior Court judges at their retention elections. Deputy District Attorney <a href="http://www.amadorforjudge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Amador</a> has been working as a prosecutor for the last twenty-nine years, and is currently running for Superior Court Judge.</p>

<p>When Robert Amador joined the District Attorneyâ€™s Office, he wanted to work in homicide and set hefty goals for himself. He then realized as a District Attorney, that justice was served on a per case basis, and cases were often few and far between. Now, Amador wants to serve the San Diego on a larger scale. As a judge, he would be able to uphold justice to a greater extent.</p>

<p>After college, Amador wanted to go into the police force, but due to poor eyesight was unable to join the force. Amador decided to attend law school instead, giving him the ability to be involved in the justice system - allowing him to better serve his community.</p>

<p>If elected, Amador aims to serve justice in a fair, equal, and respectful manner. Regarding being elected a judge, Amador says, "When people leave my courtroom, they should feel that justice has been served, and that they were treated appropriately."</p>

<p>Amador is currently working as a law enforcement&nbsp;liaison, offering support to sheriffs around San Diego County. As the election nears, he has been reaching out to many San Diego politicians to discuss his experience and explain why he is running regardless of political affiliation.</p>

<p>Attorneys must be a member of the <a href="http://www.calbar.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">State Bar of California</a> for at least ten years in order to be eligible to become a Superior Court judge in California. Robert has been in good standing with the bar association his entire legal career.</p>

<p>The election is one week away, and now it is up to voters in deciding who is the best fit to serve as San Diego Superior Court Judge for the next six years.</p>
