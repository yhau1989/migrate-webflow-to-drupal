<p>The OB, or Ocean Beach Farmers Market takes place every Wednesday, from 4-8pm on Newport Ave (between Cable and Bacon Streets).&nbsp;While most farmers markets in San Diego offer a similar variety of produce, dips, honey, oils, and breads, the OB farmers market stands alone in its dedication to creating an experience for the whole family.</p>

<p>Enclosed with palm trees and just minutes from the beach, the OB farmers market is a vibrant celebration of San Diego beach culture and agricultural produce.&nbsp;Upon entering the bustling street, one's senses are immediately activated. Tastes, scents, and sights are everywhere, with a seemingly endless line of vendors to visit.&nbsp;Unlike most other farmers markets in the county, the sensory experience of OB is not limited to those in the market for fresh food.</p>
