<p>Del Mar's annual street fair, <a href="http://taste.delmarmainstreet.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Del Mar Taste and Art Stroll</a>, highlighted the art, culinary genius, and beautiful&nbsp;scenery that the ocean-side city of Del Mar has to offer.&nbsp;In its seventh year, the art festival attracted around ten thousand attendees, was open to the public, children, and pet-friendly.&nbsp;Located in the heart of Del Mar village, the Del Mar Taste and Art Stroll spanned across five blocks, with displays of paintings, glass, jewelry, arts and crafts, face painting, and of course, food.</p>

<p>The festival is a chance for local and regional artists to showcase their work to the "<a href="http://taste.delmarmainstreet.com/art/artist-participation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">affluent and sophisticated</a>" locals and visitors of Del Mar, and an opportunity to meet with other local artists, chefs, musicians, and community leaders.</p>

<p>The festival also featured a culinary tour of the local restaurants that make the vibrant city one of the most popular tourist attractions in San Diego.&nbsp;<a href="http://delmarpizza.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Del Mar Pizza</a>, for example, is one of the twenty-eight restaurants participating in Taste of Del Mar 2012. As a small, local, independent business, Del Mar Pizza makes all their food from scratch and relies on service from local residents and San Diegans for continued business. Other businesses included some local favorites like Board &amp; Brew, Cafe Secret, Pacifica Del Mar, PrepKitchen Del Mar, Sbicca, Seaside Yogurt, Jake's Del Mar, and KITCHEN 1540.</p>

<p>With purchase of a Taste ticket, each guest was invited to take a culinary tour down Camino Del Mar, visiting each food station for a sampling of the restaurants participating. Tastes included sushi from Sushi Japone, a lobster and bacon stuffed potato skin from KITCHEN 1540, ahi tacos from Jake's Del Mar, and bacon wrapped dates from PrepKitchen Del Mar, to name a few.&nbsp;The tour was not limited to humans either, with a handful of&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;providing treats for dogs.</p>

<p>At the end of the tour, food critics were asked to cast their vote in <em>Ranch &amp; Coast</em>'s annual "Tastiest Taste" contest, to enter to win a prize. The winning dish will be featured in November's issue of <em>Ranch &amp; Coast</em>, a San Diego lifestyle magazine.</p>

<p>While enjoying the tastes of Del Mar, visitors could view the many tables of art set up along Camino Del Mar. Paintings mirrored the interests of the likely audience, with images of the beach, surfers, and sunsets a popular subject for local artists. Festival-goers were also greeted with live music, with local musicians playing from 10am-5pm on 11th street, L'Auberge Amphitheater, Del Mar Plaza, 1313 Camino Del Mar, and 1201 Camino Del Mar.</p>

<p>The festival was kid-friendly, with face-painting stations, henna tattoos, children's crafts, and access to the Del Mar library.&nbsp;Within walking distance of the beach and a short drive away from Del Mar's dog-friendly beach, the location of the festival attracted locals and visitors alike to experience art in the streets.&nbsp;Appealing to all the senses, Del Mar Taste &amp; Art Stroll offered visitors and locals the opportunity to see, taste, and hear the culture of the San Diego beach town Del Mar.</p>
