<p>There are only a handful of restaurants and lounges around San Diego that can be recommended to anyone and you know they will enjoy it. <a href="http://www.starlitesandiego.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starlite</a> San Diego on India Street is slightly off the beaten path outside Little Italy, but it’s worth the venture.</p>

<p>When you walk up to the building you’ll be greeted with a cinderblock building with dark wooden accents, surrounded by several cacti in rock and metal planters. The building and interior design was created by San Diego’s own <a href="http://www.allthebellsandwhistles.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bells &amp; Whistles</a> including a beautiful hexagonal entryway and modern steel tube chandelier hanging over the sunken bar. The chandelier sets the feel for the interior bar as the light reflects off a mirrored ceiling.</p>

<p>Patrons are seated in black leather booths around the bar highlighted by stone walls, natural walnut paneling, cork tiles, and palm decor. The quiet, dim room is perfect for a date night, business meeting, or a drink.</p>

<p>Step through the interior bar, up a cement staircase and into a sprawling patio with retractable canvass roof. You’ll feel like you stepped into a retro desert celebrity oasis, reminiscent of <a href="http://www.tikiroom.com/img/35x4b337fbb.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer">1970s</a> Palm Springs.</p>

<p>Take a seat at one of the outside tables and enjoy a dish from the ever-changing “<a href="http://www.slowfoodurbansandiego.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">slow food</a>” <a href="http://www.starlitesandiego.com/food/dinner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">menu</a> reflecting local, natural, fresh, and sustainable ingredients. Starlite capitalizes on the year-round seasonal produce available in San Diego, crafted by Executive Chef Kathleen Wise</p>

<p>If you’re dropping in for a <a href="http://www.starlitesandiego.com/drink/" rel="noopener noreferrer">drink</a> enjoy a Kentucky Colonel, made with Buffalo Trace bourbon, ginger beer, lemon, and house made cherry vanilla bitters served in a signature copper mug.</p>

<p>During <a href="http://www.starlitesandiego.com/drink/happy-hour/" rel="noopener noreferrer">happy hour</a> enjoy their traditionally baked mac &amp; cheese. Happy hour takes place every day of the week from 5-7pm with a 4pm cocktail hour on Fridays. Sunday and Monday include $6 Starlite mules and $15 off any bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Next time you’re looking for a new lounge or restaurant in San Diego, Starlite is your best bet and you’re sure to recommend it to all your friends soon.</p>
