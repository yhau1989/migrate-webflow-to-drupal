<p>In California, voters will be presented with a choice of whether or not to end the death penalty by voting for or against <a href="While social media statistics are not the end-all be-all of a campaign, they are playing an increasingly important role in state and local elections. As the November 6th nears, California voters are debating the merits of the death penalty on Twitter." rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 34</a> this November.</p>

<p>According to the California Legislative Analyst's <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/10/27/some-agreement-on-lao-proposition-34-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">assessment</a>, the passage of Prop 34 would save an estimated $100 million annually in the first few years and grow to about $130 million annually thereafter. Opposition to the California proposition relies largely on emotional appeal to the death penalty's deterring effect.&nbsp; Focusing on narratives of families of murder victims, <a href="https://vimeo.com/51115953" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Case Against Prop 34</a>&nbsp;is part of a campaign to preserve the California death penalty.</p>

<p>In an election where money plays such a large, and arguably disproportionate, role, it is important to look at the top donors and campaigns funding both the "Yes" and "No" campaigns.&nbsp;The top two&nbsp;funders are Nicholas Pritzker and the Atlantic Advocacy Fund, where their $6 million comes from&nbsp;4,000 individual donors, all giving between $5 and $1 million.&nbsp;Californians for Justice and Public Safety falls far behind, only reaching $0.245 million. The "Yes" campaign has almost 25 times more campaign cash on board, which is reflected in their social media strategies.</p>

The account also taps into their audience by thanking supporters for their part in ending the death penalty, sharing videos and images, and tweeting out polls and statistics.</p>

The account has under 100 followers.</p>

<p>While social media statistics are not the end-all be-all of a campaign, they are playing an increasingly important role in state and local elections. As November 6th nears, California voters are debating the merits of the death penalty on Twitter.</p>

<p>And in the fight to end the death penalty in California, every tweet counts.</p>
