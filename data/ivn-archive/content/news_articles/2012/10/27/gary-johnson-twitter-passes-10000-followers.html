<p><img alt="" height="224" src="cloudinary://gary-johnson-twitter-passes-10000-followers-21115.jpg" title="Gary Johnson Twitter Facebook" width="597">Most politicos were watching President Obama's speech today in Nashua, New Hampshire, where he hit on a his main theme of "moving forward." Elsewhere, third party candidates like <a href="http://www.jillstein.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jill Stein</a> and <a href="http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a> are looking forward to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/26/gary-johnson-and-jill-stein-will-debate-one-on-one/" rel="noopener noreferrer">debating in Washington D.C.</a> on October 30th, where they will focus on moving away from the two-party controlled political discussion.</p>

<p>A common trope after the final mainstream Presidential debate was that it wasn't much of a debate. &nbsp;The two candidates essentially agreed on all major issues, from intervention in Afghanistan, the need to protect Israel, and putting increased sanctions on Iran. From ending the war on drugs, to ending the wars oversees, many voters have turned to third party candidates for alternative perspectives.</p>

<p>Gary Johnson is perhaps the most popular "online candidate" since Ron Paul, and undoubtably draws many of the Congressman's supporters. And with over <a href="https://www.facebook.com/govgaryjohnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">300,000 Facebook Likes</a>, over 1,000,000 <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GovGaryJohnson/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google+ followers</a>, and as of today, over 100,000 <a href="http://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> followers, Gary Johnson could be laying the groundwork to make a significant impact on the political conversation for a long-time to come.</p>

<p>Politics and technology are at an&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;cross-roads. The big number of reliable votes are still made by the folks sitting in a reclining chair with a remote control in their hand, but it won't be long until those who grew up with Facbeook and Twitter start to really change the playing field.</p>
