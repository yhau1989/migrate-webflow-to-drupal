<p>On a Tuesday night in late April, GOP presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, took the stage at Southern New Hampshire University. With his smiling wife, Ann, standing close beside him, the former Massachusetts governor stood behind a podium that read: <em>A better America Begins Tonight. </em>His victory in the 2012 primaries was official.</p>

<p>“Tonight is the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years,” Romney told the boisterous New England crowd. “I have a very different vision for America, and of our future.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the America Romney champions differs from the current Obama administration. However, these divergent values are not what seems to be perplexing American voters as Election Day approaches. More and more the question is, what exactly is Romney’s vision? For months Romney has been portrayed in the media as chameleon-like, constantly flip-flopping on core policies and values. Most are quick to point out Romney’s drastic value changes over the past decade. Over and over we are given the story of an open-minded, socially liberal governor, turned hardline arch-conservative 2012 GOP frontrunner.</p>

<p>Ultimately anyone is capable of changing their values over the course of a decade.&nbsp;What is more telling, however, is how Romney’s policies have evolved in the last six months on the campaign trail. Below are eleven explicit differences between primary and general election Mitt Romney.</p>

<p><strong>1) Who to Tax</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB90n-pRldk&amp;feature=related" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then</a>: Obama's policy is weak and apologetic. Romney will lead the charge of an unapologetic and headstrong American diplomacy.</p>

<p><strong>3) Afghanistan Withdrawal Dates</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/23/politics/fact-check/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then</a>: Obama should never have publicly stated a withdrawal.</p>
