<h4>Requests Attorney General to Investigate Market Procedures</h4>
<p>On October 9, Senator <a href="http://sd40.senate.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juan Vargas</a> (D-Chula Vista) held another press conference regarding the spike in gasoline costs.&nbsp; This would mark his second press conference regarding the issue in a period less than one week. With&nbsp;California’s gasoline prices reaching a new record high at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-california-gas-prices-one-more-new-record-20121009,0,6234697.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.671 per gallon</a>, Senator Vargas expressed his own, as well as citizens' concerns.</p>

<p>Senator Vargas praised Governor Jerry Brown for utilizing his emergency powers to allow refineries to commence the production of winter-grade fuel on October 7. However, his impromptu press conference demonstrated his outrage regarding the gas spike in southern California.</p>

<p>“I’m pissed off,” stressed Vargas, “and if no one else is pissed off, they very well should be.”</p>

<p>The cause behind Vargas’ resentment was that consumers have seen no decrease in fuel costs, which he feels should have taken effect by now.&nbsp; As Vargas pointed in the direction of gasoline pumps and price-per-gallon placards, he alluded to the fact that the gas spike happened almost overnight.</p>

<p>“With prices like these, you have to know something is up,” stated Vargas. “This is wrong, and we shouldn’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>That being said, he felt that if prices could increase so dramatically in such a short period of time that they could come down just as quickly.</p>

<p>Vargas is following suit with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Cali.), who recently requested that the Federal Trade Commission investigate the unprecedented gas spike on suspicion of illegal market procedures.</p>

<p>“The market is not functioning as it should,” said Vargas. “Prosecutors should be investigating here, not politicians.&nbsp; Someone has to be held responsible, and this is why I am writing a letter to <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attorney General Harris</a> asking her to investigate.”</p>

<p>Senator Vargas added that this investigation would not negatively affect the production of winter-grade fuel in California.</p>

<p>It appears that Senators Vargas and Feinstein have both been provided with little, if any, &nbsp;information about what is really causing this issue. &nbsp;This in itself is troublesome.&nbsp; These elected officials have been left out in the cold, which poses the question: “Where does that leave voters?”</p>
