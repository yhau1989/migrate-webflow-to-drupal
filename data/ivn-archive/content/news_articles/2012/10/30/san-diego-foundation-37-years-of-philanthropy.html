<p>The San Diego Foundation is public charity that awards grants to nonprofit organizations and causes that operate within the city. What began in 1975 as a center for charitable assets in San Diego has grown to a leading resource to assist in San Diego's needs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sdfoundation.org/Portals/0/AboutUs/TSDFFact%20Sheet_julyAug2012.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">As of August 2012</a>, the San Diego Foundation has awarded $791 million in grants since its inception. &nbsp;The San Diego Women's Foundation, Charitable Real Estate Foundation, and the Balboa Park Trust are notable affiliates of the SD Foundation.</p>

<p>The Foundation covers a <a href="http://www.sdfoundation.org/AboutUs/FastFacts.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">wide spectrum of San Diego's offerings</a>. Assets donated by contributors and managed by the foundation result in grants that come out to:</p>
<blockquote>More than $60 million each year go to outstanding&nbsp;non-profits&nbsp;throughout the county, in areas such as the environment, arts and culture, science and technology, civil society, health and human services, and disaster relief.</blockquote>
<blockquote>More than 1,600 individuals, families and corporations house their philanthropic funds at The Foundation. These include endowment, non-endowment, legacy and scholarship funds.</blockquote>
<p>The San Diego Foundation also houses funds from Audrey Geisel, Ruben H. Fleet family, and Sol and Helen Price. The foundation shows dedication to education funding by awarding over $15 million in scholarships with its Community Scholarship Program.</p>

<p>Nonprofits of San Diego require grants to remain operational.&nbsp; Wit the existence of organization such as the San Diego Foundation, the nonprofits truly reflect the character of the city - genuinely caring of others, and especially philanthropic.</p>
