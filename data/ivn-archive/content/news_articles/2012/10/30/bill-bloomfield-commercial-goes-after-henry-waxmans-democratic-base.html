<p><img alt="" height="350" src="cloudinary://bill-bloomfield-commercial-goes-after-henry-waxmans-democratic-base-18070.jpg" title="Billl Bloomfield Henry Waxman Congress" width="600">California is undergoing a <a href="http://ivn.us/openprimaries/2012/10/28/arizonas-proposition-121-and-why-it-matters-to-everyone-else/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quiet revolution out West</a>. Coming off of its first non-partisan open primary, there are several races this year that won't look familiar to everyday politicos. And a new <a href="http://bloomfieldforcongress.com/welcome/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Bloomfield</a> commercial proves that the landscape has changed.</p>

<p>Because of the new <a href="http://ivn.us/openprimaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">"top-two" style</a> primary system, this year's 33rd congressional district is pitting Bill Bloomdfield, an independent businessman, against Democratic&nbsp;stalwart Henry Waxman head-to-head.&nbsp;In this Democrat heavy district, Waxman has been reelected comfortably 19 straight times to his seat in Congress. But with the new rule change, an independent Bil Bloomfield has a real shot against the Congressman.</p>

<p>Waxman, known as one of the more partisan members of Congress, is not likely to pick up many non-Democrat votes. And while&nbsp;Bloomfield is a first time candidate, he is no political novice. In fact, he was an early supporter of the non-partisan open primary. The theme of his campaign has been that partisanship doesn't work, and representatives like Waxman are at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>in his latest commercial, Bloomfield is hitting Waxman right at his base, appealing directly to Democratic voters. "I've voted for Henry Waxman 19 times. Not this time."</p>
