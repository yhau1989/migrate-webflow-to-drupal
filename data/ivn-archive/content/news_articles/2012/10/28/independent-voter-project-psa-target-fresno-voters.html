<p>Today, the Independent Voter Project began airing a series of get-out-the vote messages which will be targeting in districts where independent-minded voters are likely to make an impact. The purpose of the public service announcements are to remind voters that regardless of their party affiliation, their vote counts more than ever this election, even if there is not a candidates from their party on the ballot.</p>

<p>This is particularly important in Fresno, where two Republicans square off this general election. It will be the Democrats and independents that will decide the election. There is also a spanish version of the PSA. IVP's research shows that 32% of the population in AD23 is latino and is a large block of voters who largely self-identify as independent voters.</p>
