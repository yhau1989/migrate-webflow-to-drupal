<p>SAN DIEGO, CA –October 29<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2012--The Independent Voter Network (IVN.us) invites you to appetizers, drinks, and some non-partisan fun at its official Election Night Party on November 6, 2012 at Marina Kitchen. The event will be held at Marriott Marquis &amp; Marina at 333 West Harbor Drive South Tower Lobby Level. The event starts at 5pm.</p>

<p>IVN.us launched a local news outlet just two weeks ago right here in its hometown of San Diego to bring a non-partisan and civil discussion of local and statewide politics to the city. The launch of IVN San Diego also serves as a prototype for the expansion of the news platform into other cities.</p>

<p>IVN, in its first year of development, reached over 3 million people last week online through its website and various social networks.</p>

<p>The IVN San Diego Election Party is open to all and Marina Kitchen will be providing a special IVN Election night menu with drinks and appetizers.</p>

<p>IVN is a project of the Foundation for Independent Voter Education (FIVE) a sister organization of the Independent Voter Project (IVP). FIVE is dedicated to restoring the importance of open dialogue, engagement, and constructive compromise in our political system, unfiltered by the partisanship that drives the larger public dialogue. FIVE defines “independent” as people, positions, or information not dictated by a partisan point of view.</p>
