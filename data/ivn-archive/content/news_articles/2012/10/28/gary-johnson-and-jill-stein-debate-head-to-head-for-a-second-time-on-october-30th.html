<p>Gary Johnson and Jill Stein debate head to head for a second time on November 5th.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="http://freeandequal.org/?v=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free and Equal</a> hosted a debate with the four main third-party candidates Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, Rocky Anderson, and Virgil Goode. After the debate, Free and Equal offered users the opportunity to choose who they would like to see debate head-to-head in a second round, using a top-two election.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://freeandequal.org/updates/winners-of-october-23-presidential-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free and Equal</a> released the results and not surprisingly, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein received the most votes.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/free-and-equal1.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="331" src="cloudinary://free-and-equal1.jpg" width="600"></a>Johnson and Stein will face each other for a second time after having already debated head-to-head on&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN.us</a> on October 18th. IVN.us presented the candidates with questions directly from independent voters entirely online through Google+ Hangout. This was the first time two candidates have debated in real-time from different locations, Dr. Stein in Seattle, WA while Gov. Johnson was in Laramie, WY.</p>

<p>On November 5th, the set up will be more classic as Stein and Johnson will address each other from Russia Today's studio in Washington, DC. The debate originally scheduled for October 30th has been&nbsp;postponed due to the <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/10/26/frankenstorm-could-affect-gas-prices-and-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankenstorm</a> currently disturbing the various presidential campaigns on the East Coast.</p>

<p>During the Free and Equal debate last Tuesday the four candidates were asked questions on 5 main topics: 1. their opinion on the top two primary system, 2. the war on drugs, 3. the rising costs of college&nbsp;tuition, 4. indefinite military detention under the NDAA and 5. what amendments they would make to the Constitution.</p>

<p>This leaves a wide range of issues untouched to be&nbsp;addressed&nbsp;during the November 5th debate. The debate is likely to be the last opportunity to hear Gary Johnson and Jill Stein before the November 6 election. Follow the debate on <a href="http://freeandequal.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free and Equal</a> or here on IVN on November 5th beginning at 9pm Eastern.</p>
