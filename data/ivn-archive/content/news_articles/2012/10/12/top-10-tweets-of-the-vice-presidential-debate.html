<p>Last night, vice presidential candidates Joe Biden and Paul Ryan took to the stage at&nbsp;Centre College in Danville, Kentucky to debate the economy, foreign policy, medicare, social&nbsp;security, and abortion. Meanwhile, the internet community was actively tweeting the debate, sending a total of <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/12/twitter-vice-presidential-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.5 million tweets</a> during the vice presidential debate. While this is only one-third the amount of tweets sent during the first presidential debate between President Obama and former Governor Mitt Romney, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan sparked some interesting conversation online. The internet community jumped on the opportunity to capitalize on the newly released workout photos of Paul Ryan, quickly generating a <a href="http://mansplainingryan.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of internet memes</a> poking fun at the photos. Joe Biden's smile also received a lot of attention on Twitter,&nbsp;prompting&nbsp;someone to create the parody account <a href="https://twitter.com/LaughinJoeBiden" rel="noopener noreferrer">@LaughinJoeBiden</a>&nbsp;which now has almost 10,000 followers. To highlight the best tweets of the night, here are the top 10 tweets of the vice presidential debate:</p>
