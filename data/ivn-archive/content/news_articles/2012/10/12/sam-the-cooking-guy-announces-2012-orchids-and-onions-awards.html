<p><img alt="" height="280" src="cloudinary://orchids-and-onions-awards-2012-18712.jpg" width="600">From the ahi tacos, to the orchid martinis, the food was almost as inspirational as the architecture. But nothing could top the light-hearted mood set by&nbsp;Sam the Cooking Guy&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.mcasd.org/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> for the <a href="http://sdarchitecture.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Architectural Foundation</a>’s (SDAF) annual <a href="http://www.orchidsandonions.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orchids and Onions Awards</a>. <img alt="" height="178" src="cloudinary://sam-the-cooking-guy-announces-2012-orchids-and-onions-awards-39597-300x178.jpg" width="300">The title sponsor of the event was the <a href="http://www.newschoolarch.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newschool Architecture of Design</a>.</p>

<p>The event included a silent auction&nbsp;with an array of wines, vacation packages, artwork, and other gifts. All proceeds went to benefit SDAF, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to help promote diverse&nbsp;architectural&nbsp;education, programming, planning, and recognition.</p>

<p>This year, Onion recipients addressed the crowd for the first time. Sam said it best, “[C]oming up on the stage to accept an Onion is the equivalent to having architectural balls.” But what the guests learned from many of the Onion speeches is that the perception of a failed project to some, may be accompanied by a brighter story that&nbsp;can't be measured by an&nbsp;architectural&nbsp;jury. Below are the "Orchids" and "Onions" accompanied by some of the most memorable quotes from the night’s light-hearted event.</p>
<h6>#1 - Orchid: Public Art at Ocean Beach Comfort Station</h6>
