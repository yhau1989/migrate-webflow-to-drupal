<p><a href="http://thepearlsd.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pearl Hotel</a> is one of those unique places in San Diego that pervades the city's&nbsp;eclectic, progressive, and nostalgic vibe. &nbsp;Passing by the unassuming strip malls, Starbucks, and fast food joints that compose Rosecrans Street , it may seem like an unlikely spot for a boutique hotel. &nbsp;In fact, there are several hotels in this area that appear to have seen better days - but perhaps that was back in the seventies when they were designed.</p>

<p>On the surface The Pearl is a hotel - a hotel that could have been used on the set of an early James Bond film. &nbsp;The underlying theme, however is that the hotel is a sustainable project of San Diego entrepreneur and Pearl Owner Greg Strangman.</p>

<p>Strangman owns and operates <a href="http://www.lwpgroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">LWP Group,</a> which stands for the acronym for Live Work Play. &nbsp;LWP is involved in the acquisition of older buildings in San Diego, which the company refurbishes in a completely sustainable and sleek manner. &nbsp;Strangman is also actively involved in nonprofit work, as seen in his San Diego nonprofit Community Gives. &nbsp;Community Gives is geared towards education, arts, and culture for San Diego youths.</p>

<p>As part of their check-in procedures for guests, The Pearl suggests that one dollar a day be donated to Community Gives. &nbsp;This donation is totally voluntary, but ultimately benefits an important community nonprofit.</p>

<p>The Pearl is completely original to San Diego. &nbsp;Upon initial view, the classic mother-of-pearl cursive lettering adorning the Rosecrans two-story retro lodging - which is surrounded by palms on all fronts - provides a glimpse into a more sophisticated era. It's front glass facade creates the illusion of a fish bowl, which is a necessary accessory to the swimming pool.</p>

<p>Not only is this a hotel, where rooms are designed in a streamlined, chic, modern fashion, but also a restaurant, bar, and movie theater. &nbsp;Yes, a movie theater.</p>

<p>One of The Pearl's favorite amenities, the "<a href="http://www.thepearlsd.com/default.aspx?pg=divein" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dive-in Theatre</a>," a screen which is located to the northeast side of the swimming pool and bar, is one-of-a-kind in San Diego, and perhaps southern California. &nbsp;The Dive-in Theatre derives its name from the fact that guests can swim while taking a flick, or having a drink. &nbsp;Another thing - admission is free to all movies, which range from cult classics, comedies, and season-oriented films every Wednesday night at 8 pm. &nbsp;During October, The Dive-in Theatre is showing the 80s classic&nbsp;<em>Rad,&nbsp;</em>Audrey Hepburn's&nbsp;<em>Breakfast at Tiffany's, Donnie Darko,&nbsp;</em>and Tim Burton's&nbsp;<em>Edward Scissorhands&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Beetlejuice</em>.</p>

<p>"This is one of the first in San Diego," says Pearl Marketing Director Danielle Munn of the Dive-in. &nbsp;"We serve specialty cocktails that coincide with the movie, so the theater is fantastic for drinks, date night, or to get together with friends."</p>

<p>Since the Dive-in is such a popular facet of the hotel, and is adjacent to the restaurant, bar, and swimming pool, it is encouraged to make reservations for parties larger than six.</p>

<p>Continuing in the realm of film, the Pearl also hosts a documentary night on the third Thursday of every month. &nbsp;In showing these documentaries, The Pearl teams up with various business partners operational in San Diego. &nbsp;In honor of All Hallow's Eve, The Pearl has partnered with Zombie Industries, a San Diego-based production company, for the month of October.</p>

<p>Adding on to the activities, The Pearl hosts a bingo night the last Thursday of every month (check in 9 pm, begins at 9:30 pm). &nbsp;Bingo prizes include happy hour deals, free one night stays, meals, and lots of other great swag.</p>

<p>Further utilizing the restaurant and bar, The Pearl will be hosting several other events in October and November. &nbsp;One event, "Hops 'n' Heels," which is catered towards San Diego women, will entail four desserts provided by Azucar (Ocean Beach) paired with Stone Brewing Company beers. &nbsp;Hops 'n' Heels will be held from 5:30-7:30 pm, and tickets are twenty dollars online. &nbsp;Another event, BYOB (Bring Your Own Bowl) will be held on Sunday, November 11 from 4-7 pm. &nbsp;The Bring Your Own Bowl event will include free soup from Mama's Kitchen, where guests receive free soup - provided they bring their own bowl.</p>

<p>The Pearl is also holding their fourth annual pumpkin carving competition on Thursday, October 25, which is a competition where tools/pumpkins are provided, and prizes are doled out to winners.</p>

<p>Whether it involve a relaxed movie night with friends (including the benefit of not having to clean up after everyone), a "stay-cation" at one of their lodgings to break away from the grind, or for some food and drinks, a visit to The Pearl Hotel will surely support a genuinely rare local business, and ultimately benefit a nonprofit organization.</p>

<p><em>The Pearl Hotel is located at 1410 Rosecrans Street 619.226.6100. The Pearl is also available to rent for weddings, holiday parties, or any other group get together. &nbsp;For information on availability and booking, email&nbsp;</em>sales@thepearlsd.com.</p>
