<p>How did we survive before Twitter and our ability to instantaneously interact with like minded people on a daily basis?&nbsp;Twitter has changed the way we watch and interact in the political world. Judging by the Twitter highlights of the debate, the social network has been effective in providing a platform for independent-minded voters to voice their opinions. Before the advent of social media, the voices of independent voters was often times ignored, but as technology advances, it paves way for alternative voices.</p>
