<p>On Sunday the world lost Antoni Dobrowolski, the oldest known survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Mr. Dobrowolski passed away in the Polish town of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=debno+poland&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x47076b814bbc2999:0x7c821114a1da0f9f,D%C4%99bno,+Poland&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=IpOFUK_RD5Po2gXb24H4Bw&amp;ved=0CJkBELYD" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debno</a> at age 108.</p>

<p>Antoni Dobrowolski was imprisoned by the Germans in 1942 after being arrested by the Gestapo. Prior to being moved to Auschwitz, he was imprisoned in the concentration camps of Gross-Rosen and Sachenhausen, according to the Auschwitz museum.</p>

<p>In Dobrowolski’s case he was sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auschwitz</a>, the notorious death camp also known as Birkenau. His fate was rare, as an estimated 1.1 million people were killed in the camp between 1940 and 1945.</p>

<p>Dobrowolski’s capture and imprisonment was a part of a much larger effort to arrest those caught educating Polish children.</p>

<p>When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, sparking WWII, the German occupiers banned all education of the Poles beyond four years of elementary education. The tactic was a portion of a larger strategy to use the Poles as a slave race.</p>

<p>Immediately an underground movement began to teach Polish children and those involved in teaching the students were sent to concentration camps or prisons.</p>

<p>Dobrowolski was arrested for educating young students, but returned to teaching after the war ended.</p>

<p>Following the war, Antoni Dobrowolski moved to Debno where he worked as a Polish-language teacher and principal at an elementary school and later at a high school.</p>

<p>He will be buried in Debno on Wednesday.</p>
