<p><img alt="" height="350" src="cloudinary://bob-schieffer-proves-to-be-a-big-game-moderator-61317.png" title="Bob Scheiffer Moderator of Debate" width="600">Let’s hope CNN’s Candy Crowley, PBS staple Jim Lehrer and all future moderators of high-level political discourse were watching a master at work last night in the third Presidential debate of 2012.</p>

<p>Veteran CBS newsman Bob Schieffer was like a good umpire in a high-pressure baseball game. He let the players decide the outcome. He made no calls or interjected his presence above what everybody was tuned in to see: the combatants.</p>

<p>There has been scattered criticism of Schieffer for letting the debate stray from its intended sole focus: foreign policy. Both President Obama and Governor Romney did turn away from international issues to promote their domestic planks. But to use a football metaphor, Schieffer “let ‘em play,” and use the same set of referee rules to oversee both.</p>

<p>In fairness to putting Crowley’s performance below Schieffer’s, it should be noted that her circumstance – a public forum, where the audience asks questions and the candidates are free to stroll around the stage – is tougher to control than a sit-down face-to-face tilt.</p>

<p>NBC’s iconic former anchor Tom Brokaw was skewered on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> after he moderated the 2008 Presidential public-forum prize fight. The joke was that Brokaw barely let candidates answer a question, much less let audience members finish queries, before yelling out, “Time!”</p>

<p>Independent observers might agree that this year, Lehrer, Crowley and Schieffer swung the other way, and gave the candidates more-than-ample time to over-respond.</p>

<p>But Lehrer let the game get out of hand. And Crowley seemed to want to offer partisan fact-checking. Schieffer, instead, followed up with slightly more focused follow-up questions.</p>

<p>Schieffer has been with CBS News since 1969. He anchored the weekend edition of <em>CBS Evening News </em>from 1973 to 1996, moderates <em>Face The Nation</em> and has been an interim anchor for the weekday evening news.</p>

<p>Lehrer and Crowley are no stiffs. Crowley has earned her spot as a talking head. And Lehrer (like Schieffer) has moderated Presidential debates during the last three elections.</p>

<p>It’s Schieffer, though, who has proven to be the strong-but-relatively-silent moderator who’s the right call for championship games.</p>
