<p><a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/propositions/about-prop-35/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prop 35</a> would change the legal consequences of human trafficking offenses in California. If passed, the proposition would increase prison sentences, require sex traffickers to register as sex offenders and to disclose all of their internet accounts, require criminal fines to pay for victim services, and mandate law enforcement training on human trafficking. Both sides of the argument have support from attorneys, nonprofits, and sex workers' rights groups which are funding Proposition 35's "Yes" and "No" campaigns.</p>
<h3>YES on Prop 35</h3>
<p>Proposition 35 is jointly funded by California Against Slavery and the Safer California Foundation. California Against Slavery (CAS) is a non-profit, non-partisan human rights organization dedicated to ending human trafficking in California. The Safer California Foundation, which was created by former Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Chris Kelly, is dedicated to supporting efforts to protect Californians from all forms of criminal exploitation.</p>

<p>Many have endorsed Prop 35, including law enforcement and advocacy groups such as the Peace Officers Research Association and the Crowley Children’s Fund, to name a few.</p>

<p>“Anonymity on the internet has allowed human traffickers access and opportunity to sexually exploit children in our state. Right now, we are missing out on critical data that could protect kids online. By requiring sex offenders to provide information to the authorities about their online accounts we can make the internet a much safer place for California’s children,” Kelly <a href="http://www.caseact.org/news/case-act-campaign-submits-865000-signatures-to-qualify-for-november-2012-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated.</a></p>
<h3>NO on Prop 35</h3>
<p>There are several groups that are against <a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/propositions/about-prop-35/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 35</a>, such as the Exotic Service Providers Legal, Education, and Research Project, which have put together statements arguing that the measure would threaten innocent people by broadening the definition of “pimping.”</p>

<p>These groups see the proposition's definition of human trafficking as vague and worry about prosecution. Cases that involve human trafficking can be difficult to prosecute because victims are often too scared to come forward.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to Vote Yes or No on Proposition 35 and now is the time for you to decide.</p>
