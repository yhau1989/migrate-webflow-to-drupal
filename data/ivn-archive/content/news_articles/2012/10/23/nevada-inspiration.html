<p><img alt="" height="325" src="cloudinary://nevada-inspiration-47686.jpg" title="Steven-Horsford-Nevada" width="600">As the content coordinator for Vote-USA.org I read a lot of candidate websites and transfer the content into the Vote-USA.org website. Ever so often I read something that is not the same old clap trap about the wondrous things these politicians are going to do for us. Stuff that really captures my attention, unusual stories about unusual people in politics. I would like to share three I found while scraping the websites of Nevada candidates.</p>

<p>One of them is Democrat <a href="http://www.stevenhorsford.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Horsford</a>. This person became the effective head of his family at age 10 after his father was shot dead, while his mother was an addict and his grandmother had to be cared for round-the-clock. As an adult, he created a culinary training program that placed thousands of homeless people in work, then became the youngest (and the first black) Majority Leader in Nevada State Senate. He then stood up to a wrongful plan by the Governor, resulting in Nevada achieving a balanced budget while retaining the full funding for the state's school.</p>

<p>Another is Independent American <a href="http://stanvaughan.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stan Vaughan</a>. Vaughan is a chess champion at many levels and the winner of a number of world records over many years. He is also the author of a best-selling book. As someone who knows a few things about chess, I know how hard it is to get anywhere in chess. A person who becomes a multi-time chess champion, while coming from Nevada, is certainly someone who gets my respect.</p>

<p>Another is Independent American <a href="http://ccnviap.org/vanderbeek/" rel="noopener noreferrer">David VanderBeek</a>. His statement says the following:</p>

<p>"2012 is not the end of the world, go tell your masters that 2012 is the end of their world and the beginning of our world. 2012 is the beginning of a global shift in human consciousness. It is a renewal. Balance between nature and technology. It is richness. It is health.</p>

<p>"I will not die for my country. I subscribe to the philosophy of another patriot General George Patton. I have no intention of dying for my country. So, if the federal governments thinks they will oppress men like, I intend to make some other poor bastard die for his country. I'm going live as a wild and free American man. I don't want fame. I don't want fortune. I just want to be free to raise my children in peace, health, and comfort.</p>

<p>"I am David Lory Van Der Beek. I am of sound mind. I am a fulfilled, happy, healthy, well American man.</p>

<p>"I care not which religion you are or are not. I am a Christian. I will defend your rights no matter who or what you are: straight, gay, muslim, hindu, christian, atheist. We can be brothers and sisters in the cause of freedom."</p>

<p>All these are highly inspirational figures, but in very different ways. Horsford is someone who came from utter hell and became a strong and accomplished leader. Vaughn is a genius who made good. And VanderBeek is a courageous visionary. They are great in different ways; but they are all great.</p>

<p>America benefits greatly from having such people in it. And for as long as there are such people in America, America's best days are still ahead of it.</p>
