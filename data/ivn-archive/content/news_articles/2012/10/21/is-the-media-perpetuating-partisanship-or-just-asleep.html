<p>Republican vs. Democrat, Red vs. Blue, MSNBC vs. Fox. It’s a vicious cycle. Key politicians dodge making tough decisions in favor of provocative partisan sound bites. The media loves – even profits from – the train wreck. The few politicians who do not play the game are crushed by the combined force of political and media partisanship.</p>

<p>As technology advances, so does our ability to attain information. We have at the touch of our fingertips a constant stream of information, and are tasked with finding the truth behind the rhetoric. With the increasing popularity of social media, stories now break on the internet, more specifically, on Twitter. The speed at which the news moves online has created a culture of sensationalism, where journalists seek headlines, not facts.</p>
