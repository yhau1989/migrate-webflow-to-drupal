<p>California's SD 19 (Santa Barbara) should be a district where Republicans are concentrating some of their efforts to prevent a Democratic super-majority in the House, but the Republican candidate Mike Stoker lags behind former CA Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D) in fundraising. When State Senator Tony Strickland (R) opted to run for US Congress, he left open a seat that could help the Democrats gain the necessary 27 seats for a two-thirds majority in California's upper house.</p>

<p>However, the district hasn't been a Democratic stronghold, but after a recent redistricting, Jackson appears to have a slight advantage in not just fundraising, but also name recognition. Back in 2008 she lost the district to State Senator Tony Strickland by less than 900 votes.</p>

<p>The district is fairly evenly split amongst Democrats, Republicans, and Decline-to-State voters, but the money isn't there, yet Mike Stoker led in the primary. According to the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-primary/pdf/97-state-senators-formatted.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">CA Secretary of State</a>, Stoker won the June 5 primary over Jackson 44.9% to 41.6%, respectively. That would bode well for the former Santa Barbara Supervisor, but if you include Democrat Jason Hodge coming in a distant third with 13.5%, you would see a much closer general election come November 6.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/18/republican-candidate-mike-stoker-speaks-out-on-open-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">May Q&amp;A</a> posted on IVN, Mike Stoker pointed out his bi-partisan accomplishments and laid out stark contrasts between himself and Ms. Jackson.</p>
<blockquote><em>...I am the only candidate supporting Democrat Governor Jerry Brownâ€™s Pension Reform proposal. My two Democrat opponents </em>[Jackson and Hodge]<em> are opposed...&nbsp;I am the only candidate focusing on Budget Reform and Regulatory Reform to help make California more business friendly.</em></blockquote>
<p>The November election will be an interesting test for a district with two same-party candidates with large amounts of votes where one did not make it to the general election. Mike Stoker could be overcome by Jackson if she gains the 13% of the June vote that went to fellow-Democrat Jason Hodge. To overcome this obstacle <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/18/republican-candidate-mike-stoker-speaks-out-on-open-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Stoker</a> plans to avoid the discussion of special interests and contribution to attract independent-minded voters.</p>

<p>Regardless of Stoker's move to gather independents, there may be too many Democrats in the district for him to win and Hannah-Beth Jackson may give the Democrats an extra seat toward the super-majority they are seeking in the Legislature.</p>
