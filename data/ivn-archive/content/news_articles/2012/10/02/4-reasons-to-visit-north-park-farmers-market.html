<p>San Diego has mastered the art of urban farming, and as San Diego's fourth largest industry, agriculture in San Diego is a year-round phenomena. Fresh produce is available everyday at any given location around the city, with over 25 farmers markets in San Diego alone. With a unique surrounding and diverse selection of food, the North Park farmers market has earned its way to the top of my list of farmers markets in San Diego for these 4 reasons:</p>

<p><strong>1. Fresh produce: </strong>Although this is somewhat of a given, the selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, garlic, herbs, and bread is reason enough to spend the extra money on buying local produce. The farmers market may seem small compared to other San Diego locations, but in terms of fresh produce, it's huge.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Home to Bitchin' Sauce:</strong> This applies to all farmers markets in San Diego. An alternative to hummas, Bitchin' sause is a&nbsp;vegan, gluten-free, almond-based, savory sauce that can be used for cooking or as a spread.&nbsp;If you haven't tried it already, I suggest the Chipotle.</p>

<p><strong>3. Honey:&nbsp;</strong>Ranked as the <a href="http://www.sandiego.org/articles/shopping/san-diego-farmers-markets.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">third</a> largest honey producer in the nation, any San Diego farmers market would not be complete without an excessive amount of honey. The North Park farmers market is no exception.</p>

<p><strong>4. Friendly, diverse atmosphere:</strong> The people at the North Park farmers market were talkative, giving this market a particularly friendly feel.&nbsp;While this farmers market is not as eclectic as the Ocean Beach farmers market, which hosts a blow up jumpy castle and llama feeding, and is not as conveniently located as the UTC farmers market located behind a well-established mall, it’s got a lot to offer. It proves that you don’t need all that glitz and glam to provide a community with fresh food. From the wide variety of produce, to the tasty dips, to the beautiful array of floral arrangements, this market brings color to the neighborhood it surrounds.</p>
