<p>For the first time in its history the Green Party has received matching public funds for the presidential election from the government, and they are on most of the state ballots.&nbsp; Though the media is only focused on the two big parties (the Democrats and Republicans), the people need to be aware that there are more than just two parties.&nbsp; The focus of the party is called the Green New Deal, which is a four-part plan to reshape our economy, put Americans back to work, and change Washington.&nbsp; When reading through it, it all basically sounds fairly simple and straight-forward.&nbsp; And several parts of it are things that most Americans have been calling for the last four years, and the Democrats and Republicans have only been giving 'lip-service' to.</p>

<p>A big focus of the Green New Deal is a focus on the transition to green energy and away from fossil fuels.&nbsp; This would be done by investing in green businesses, prioritizing green research, and it would provide jobs.&nbsp; Providing jobs is key in our current economic climate.&nbsp; A big deal was made when President Obama thwarted Congress on the Keystone Pipeline, but jobs in green energy are just as good as that and could possibly be even more long-term than the pipeline would have been.&nbsp; So let me raise this question... big oil is technically big energy as they do invest in renewable energy sources, so wouldn't they still get the tax breaks if they are given to green energy companies?&nbsp; But placing more focus on green energy would surely provide a major boost to our economy.&nbsp; As the plan says, it's a transition so that little by little we start moving in that direction.&nbsp; There would still be a need for oil production, as the less we use, the more we'd be able to export to other nations that have not replaced their focus on energy yet.&nbsp; It could easily be a win-win during this transition phase.</p>

<p>To go along with financial reform would be an economic bill of rights.&nbsp; The plan calls for the right to employment through a Full Employment program... that would be run locally. &nbsp;It calls for replacing the minimum wage with a living wage.&nbsp; This could be easily tied to inflation and/or the cost of living. &nbsp;They call for the right to decent affordable housing which includes an immediate halt to foreclosures and evictions as well as the right to accessible and affordable utilities that operate at-cost.&nbsp; Now most of our utilities are public utilities, but they also want to add in phone and internet.&nbsp; Since most of us now only have cell phones, would this mean taking over (or nationalizing) the cell phone companies?&nbsp; Wouldn't more choices be a better option and let the free market actually work?&nbsp; And what determines at-cost?&nbsp; Things will need repaired, there will be new equipment, and even new upgrades as time moves on.&nbsp; How are those planned?&nbsp; Another point is that tuition is skyrocketing for college students, and they are graduating under a burden of a major debt.&nbsp; The Green Party calls for tuition-free public education from pre-school to college.&nbsp; But they don't explain how they would get the money from this if it is federally funded.&nbsp; Education is the basis of any thriving society, and we should have a focus on improving it, but I'm not quite sure college can be completely tuition-free.&nbsp; And what about private school and even charter schools?&nbsp; Where do they fit into this plan?&nbsp; And since this would be all be funded through our tax dollars, this brings to another part which is "the right to fair taxation that's distributed in proportion to the ability to pay."&nbsp; The progressive scale of taxation can work if it coincides with one's ability to pay.&nbsp; Those that make more pay a bit more in taxes than those that make less than them, and I'm referring to percentages and not dollar amounts.</p>

<p>My overall goal for this piece wasn't to convince you to vote for the Green Party.&nbsp; It was to introduce you to them and their overall plan.&nbsp; I didn't discuss every bit of the Green New Deal... just a few points of it.&nbsp; I recommend reviewing the plan for yourself for more details.&nbsp; (click <a href="http://www.jillstein.org/summary_green_new_deal" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)&nbsp; It's an easy and quick read.&nbsp; Your vote is still your decision, but at least you have become a more educated voter in the process and that there are more than just the two options.</p>
