<p>Alex Halderman, the famous DC Internet voting system hacker, and I recently debated Internet voting security issues.</p>



<p>In my last post, I presented <a href="http://ivn.us/tomorrows-democracy/2012/09/22/canadas-national-debate-over-internet-voting-part-four/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Canadian Model</a>&nbsp;for framing the Internet voting debate. I have also posted about the many cities in Canada that use Internet voting.</p>



<p>But, just to be sure I am up to speed on all the issues, I'm taking an online&nbsp;Digital Democracy <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/digitaldemocracy" rel="noopener noreferrer">class</a> with Professor Halderman. Our debate was during his online office hours.</p>



<p><span>Issues</span>: What is more important to consider in the debate over Internet voting security -- known facts about the many successes of Internet voting trials, or scary possibilities that haven't happened? How much weight should be given the theoretical notion that a hack can go undetected? What evidence is RELEVANT to this debate?</p>



<p>Our discussion starts at 21:30 and ending at 42:00).</p>
