<p>In America's Heartland, independent voters are again a topic of scrutiny. The Indiana Senate race has become a monetary sinkhole as Republicans and Democrats pour advertising funds into the race in an attempt to pick up undecided, opposition, and independent voters.&nbsp;Americans for Prosperity, a Republican PAC, announced they would be spending&nbsp;$700,000 in a statewide ad campaign, while the The&nbsp;Majority PAC (Democrat) announced it would be investing&nbsp;$500,000 in ads in Indiana.</p>

<p>Indiana suddenly became a much heated debate after the meltdown of Todd Akin in Missouri, a race which the Republicans had predicted as solidly theirs. Since Akin's off-color rape comments, the&nbsp;Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee cancelled <a href="http://www.newstribune.com/news/2012/sep/27/akin-mccaskill-both-courting-republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">millions of dollars</a> of TV ad buys in Missouri. After the predicted loss in the state, the deadlocked senatorial race in Indiana became a higher priority for the Republican party as they attempt to gain the national Senate majority.</p>

<p>Democratic candidate Rep. Joe Donnelly has released a number of TV ads since the influx of support from The Majority PAC. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcaTucJDZxI&amp;feature=plcp" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent ad</a>, uploaded on Tuesday, attacks his opponent for not standing with middle class families. He explains that he intends to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, while creating jobs and voting against excessive spending. His opponent, Richard Mourdock, also released<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEl2M_g79s4&amp;list=UU8NUZNOBBmrA5KDBDRDMq7g&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a new ad</a> earlier this week. Mourdock's ad defames Donnelly as being out of touch with Indiana's needs, while constantly voting for big government spending, like bailouts and healthcare.</p>

<p>With 16% of Indiana's voters defining themselves<a href="http://www.kpcnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=41931" rel="noopener noreferrer"> as independent</a>, both parties are eager to appeal to this demographic. According to a recent Market Research poll of independent voters in Indiana:</p>
<blockquote>"Independent voters favored Mourdock 21 percent, Donnelly 25 percent, Horning 14 percent, while 41 percent were undecided. Itâ€™s those voters who will decide this race."</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, independent voters are still undecided in the Indiana senatorial race. Last year, the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/26/nation/la-na-obama-indiana-20110926" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a> reported that many independent voters in Indiana were disenchanted with Obama and the Democratic Party, and unlikely to vote that way in the 2012 presidential race. <a href="http://stateimpact.npr.org/indiana/2012/09/20/independent-voters-seem-to-favor-romneys-education-policies-over-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR </a>also reported that independent voters favored Romney's policies over Obama's. Could the right-leaning sentiments leak over to the senatorial race?</p>

<p>Donnelly maintains a marginal lead in the polls, but as ads start rolling out from both candidates, independent voters could determine the Indiana Senate race.</p>
