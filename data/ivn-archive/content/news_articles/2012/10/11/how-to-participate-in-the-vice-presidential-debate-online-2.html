<p>IVN is committed to the&nbsp;belief&nbsp;that democracy works best when the most people participate. One of the ways we encourage that at IVN is through the use of social media. We've created channels on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/independentvoternetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ivn" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/101219378970530930435/101219378970530930435/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google+</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/IVoterNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://pinterest.com/ivnetwork/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>, and <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/blog/ivnetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tumblr</a> to reach out to users online who share a frustration with politics today.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, IVN will be hosting a series of tweet chats during the presidential debates. This is a unique opportunity for an open discussion.&nbsp;Independent-minded voters, who are often left out of the bi-partisan rhetoric, can now connect with other independent-minded voters to discuss the 2012 election.</p>

<p>There are just 3 steps to joining in and making your voice heard:</p>

<p>1) Sign in or create a <a href="twitter.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> account</p>

<p>2) Go to <a href="http://www.tweetchat.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.tweetchat.com</a></p>

<p>3) Enter in the hashtag <strong>#indyvote&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>All tweets submitted through Tweet Chat will automatically add IVN's designated hashtag: <strong>#indyvote</strong>.</p>

<p>We will be discussing more than just bi-partisan talking points on Thursday. We will talk about not just what was said, but what was left out of the debate. Twitter is one of the fastest growing social netowrks today, with over 40 percent of users politically independent of with no party affiliation.</p>

<p>Our next tweet chat will be <strong>Thursday, October 11, 9pm EST, 6pm PST</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Join other independent-minded voters this election and make your voice heard!&nbsp;</em></p>
