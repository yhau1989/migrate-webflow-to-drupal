The campaign made special note that the are committed to staying positive, even in the face of all the bipartisan negative advertisements against the non-partisan measure:</p>
<blockquote>Noting that opponents have leveled a barrage of criticism at the measure in their effort to preserve the state’s current partisan primary election system, Johnson admitted that the ads are indeed different for a political campaign. “We too could have gone negative,” said Johnson. “Rather than become immersed in the swill of negative ads we seemingly see and hear on a constant basis, we chose a different course,” said Johnson. “After all, Prop 121 is designed to make a positive difference by leveling the playing field for all voters and all candidates.”</blockquote>
