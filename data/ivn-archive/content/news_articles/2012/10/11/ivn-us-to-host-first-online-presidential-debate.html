<p><a href="http://ivn.us/about" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN.us</a> will be hosting the first ever, online presidential debate. Unlike debates in the past, the candidates and moderators will simultaneously participate from different states. IVN.us will utilize its website and associated social media accounts to publish the event and gather questions for the candidates.</p>

<p>The participants will include Libertarian candidate and former Governor of New Mexico, <a href="http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a> and Green Party candidate Dr. <a href="http://www.jillstein.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jill Stein</a>. Governor Johnson will be joining from Laramie, Wyoming and Dr. Stein will join from Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>IVN.us is working with Google+ Politics to host the event using a live <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ccrsllod8ebmjdn8v6q1mjsdqqg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google+ Hangout</a>. Each participant will appear using videoconference technology and respond to questions submitted online and from one another.</p>
