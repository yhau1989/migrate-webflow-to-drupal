<p><strong>Drop Your Pin to Show Washington Where Partisanship Doesn't Work.</strong></p>

<p>IVN.us announces the launch of the <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/dropyourparty/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Drop Your Party Facebook App</em></a> on Facebook to show Washington, DC where partisanship is not going to work anymore. With Congressional approval ratings hovering around 10 percent, it’s time we move past party labels and start electing those who are dedicated to developing lasting solutions, regardless of party affiliation. Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, Greens, and everyone else is invited to ‘Drop Your Pin’ on the map of voters committed to independent-minded voting.</p>

<p>IVN.us is also launching a localized prototype of the news platform in San Diego on October 17th and will be hosting the first ever online presidential debate the following day. Further details will be announced soon.</p>

<p>IVN.us is an open platform for any and all viewpoints that follow our four simple etiquette guidelines.</p>
<ul>(1) No Personal Attacks: Attack the argument, not the person.</ul>
<ul>(2) No Partisan-based Attacks: Sentences starting with “Democrats think…” or “All Republicans are…” are poor choices.</ul>
<ul>(3) No Self-Promotion: This news platform is for discussing the issues.</ul>
<ul>(4) Sources Must be Substantiated: Just because someone else said it does not mean its true. The gossip stops here.</ul>
<p>Through these guidelines the Independent Voter Network is raising the level of public discourse above talking points and towards constructive dialogue between informed individuals. We believe Americans are capable of coming to their own conclusions when exposed to multiple viewpoints.</p>

<p>IVN.us has also established an <a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election Center</a> dedicated to independent-minded voters. Users simply enter their 9-digit zip code to view a sample of what their November ballot will look like. Local district races all the way up to the Presidential race is featured, as well as biographical profiles for each.</p>

<p>We know that these tools will give voters the best chance to make informed decisions by November 6th 2012.</p>
