From websites, to social networks, to phone applications, today's online&nbsp;technology provides us tools of communication that could not be imagined even a decade ago.</p>

<p>We look forward to the participation of independent-minded voters from across all party lines looking for a more reasoned and&nbsp;temperate&nbsp;discussion of the serious issues we face today. We hope you will join us as we try to level the political landscape so that participation is not conditioned on your party affiliation.</p>
