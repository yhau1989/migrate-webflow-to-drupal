<p><img alt="" height="328" src="cloudinary://Political-Landscape.jpg" title="Political Landscape" width="560">With the 2012 election finally behind us, we all witnessed how divisive and partisan our political culture has gotten. Diversity of opinion is a defining and essential characteristic of democracy, but it does not have to divide us. This week on IVN, we will pay special attention to the new make-up of our political landscape and its implications on America's evolving political culture.</p>
