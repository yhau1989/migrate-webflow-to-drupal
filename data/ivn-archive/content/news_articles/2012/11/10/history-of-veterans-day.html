<p>Veteran's Day is a day that we may know mostly as a Federal Holiday but what is the true history of Veteran's Day. November 11, 1918 is known as the end of the "war to end all wars" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Wilson</a> proclaimed November 11 as the first tribute to Armistice Day.</p>
<blockquote>"To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations…".</blockquote>
<p>-President Woodrow Wilson</p>
<p>Originally, the day&nbsp;observed suspension of business beginning at 11am, and included parades and public meetings. The ratification of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28963" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Holiday Bill</a>, which&nbsp;was signed on June 28th, 1968, outlined a three day weekend for Federal employees. &nbsp;The Uniform Holiday Bill enabled government employees to celebrate four national holidays on Monday, &nbsp;including Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Washington's Birthday, and Memorial Day. The logic behind this was aimed at allotting time for people to travel and enjoy activities outside of work, though surprisingly many states did not agree with this.</p>

<p>The first Veteran's day was celebrated on October 25, 1971.&nbsp;Currently Veteran's Day is observed on November 11, regardless of the weekday. This national holiday is observed to honor America's veterans for their love of this country and patriotism. Veterans make the utmost of sacrifices so we can enjoy the freedoms bestowed upon us through the constitution. This being said, attend or watch a veteran's parade on television. It is also highly encouraged to thank veterans for their service, as the sentiment goes a long way.</p>
