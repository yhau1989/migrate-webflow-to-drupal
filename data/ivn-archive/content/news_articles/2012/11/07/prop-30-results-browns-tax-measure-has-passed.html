<p>Projected revenue is slated at approximately $6 billion. Prop 30 will alleviate triggered budget cuts from public schools, community colleges, universities.&nbsp;K-12 education and community colleges will not lose $5.35 billion dollars across California. The University of California and California State University systems will not lose $250 million each.</p>

<p>Local public safety services such as CALFIRE and grants for city police will not lose a total of $49 million in state funding.</p>

<p>Revenues generated by Prop 30 are to be stored for educational purposes in the newly created Education Protection Account, where 89-percent of the funds would go to K-12 schools and 11-percent would go to community colleges.</p>

<p>California's spending reductions will be halted. Citizens will be playing close attention to the state government for appropriate use of Prop 30's revenue.</p>

<p>Prop 30 results throughout the night showed the measure trailing from behind from the start. As the night went on, "Yes" continually grew its lead and held on until the end.</p>
