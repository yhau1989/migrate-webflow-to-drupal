<p><a href="http://www.amadorforjudge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Amador </a>will be elected as judge to the San Diego Superior Court. Winning a landslide victory, Amador defeated private practice lawyer Jim Miller of El Cajon with 59 percent of the vote. Amador secured the position at 1:00 am on November 7.</p>

<p>Judge-elect Amador has been serving the San Diego community for thirty years as Deputy District Attorney. This race was a contested race, due to accusations on Miller’s bar accreditation with the California State Bar. This proved a dramatic change from the June primary, when Miller took 38 percent to Amador’s 33 percent.</p>

<p>During his campaign, Amador stated that he aims to service justice in San Diego in a fair, equal and respectful manner. He was endorsed by Sheriff Bill Gore, District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, and seventy-five San Diego Superior Court judges.</p>

<p>“When people leave my courtroom, they should feel that justice has been served and they were treated appropriately,” said Amador on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>His opponent Jim Miller, a native San Diegan of El Cajon, has worked as a private attorney in East County. With his experience, Miller ran for Judge of San Diego, but encountered complications when the California State Bar started questioning his bar accreditation- rating him unqualified. Miller does have a broad experience, and has worked in five areas of the county court. Miller further believes that his law background was sorely needed in courts that are overrun by judges who were once prosecutors and other government attorneys. He stated that they didn't "Want somebody coming in who's going to upset their apple cart."</p>

<p>Many promises have made by Robert Amador during the election cycle. Once he is officially the San Diego Superior Court Judge, one can hope that he lives up to his promises and the expectations of San Diego.</p>
