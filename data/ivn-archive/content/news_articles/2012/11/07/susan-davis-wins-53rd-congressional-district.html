<p>As of 1:44am, Incumbent Democratic Representative Susan Davis will have won the election for California’s 53<sup>rd</sup> Congressional District with 60.6% of the popular vote, compared to her candidate, Republican Nick Popaditch's 39.4%. She defeated Popaditch with&nbsp;96,394 votes to his 62,708 votes.</p>

<p>There are 354,345 registered voters in the 53<sup>rd</sup> District, of which 101,402 are registered Republicans, and 149,471 are registered Democrats, and 103,472 are “other or unaffiliated” voters.</p>

<p>Davis defeated Republican candidate Michael Crimmins in the 2010 election with 62.26% of the vote, with 104,790 votes to Crimmins' 57,227. She has won reelection in the past five races. Davis’ total campaign funding totaled up to $588,151, as compared to Popaditch’s total campaign funding of $98,097 total funding. Both candidates ran a fair campaign cycle, but in the end, the incumbent held on to her position.</p>

<p>The 53<sup>rd</sup> Congressional District engulfs a majority of San Diego, stretching from the heart of the city to the Mexican border, so this position will directly affect how San Diego is represented in Washington. The district is bordered to the east is the city of Lemon Grove, and to the south lies the community of La Presa. The 53rd District further stretches west and south to the cities of Coronado and Imperial Beach.</p>

<p>Davis is proud to serve such an idyllic district, saying on her website:</p>
<blockquote>"San Diego is a tourist's paradise, with many major attractions and warm sunny days year round. We can begin our tour in the north at Torrey Pines State Reserve where majestic stands of the native Torrey pine tree overlook carved sandstone cliffs and the pounding Pacific. Nearby are the world-famous Torrey Pines Golf Course, the University of California San Diego, Birch Aquarium, and the picturesque village of La Jolla."</blockquote>
<p>Surely Representative Davis will continue to perform her duties as she has done within the past five terms. Although Popaditch ran his campaign well- supporting veterans and plausible healthcare - Davis defeated him in a landslide.</p>
