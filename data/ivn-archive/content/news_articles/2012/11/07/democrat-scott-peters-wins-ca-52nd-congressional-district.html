<p>Democrat Scott Peters won California’s 52nd Congressional District in the race against incumbent opponent, Republican <a href="http://bilbrayforcongress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Bilbray</a>. He won&nbsp;with 51.2% of the vote to Bilbray's 48.8%. This election was decided early in the morning, around 2:31am.</p>
<p>The newly created 52nd district has a 9.5 percent Republican advantage, with 132,981 Republicans, 121,418 Democrats, and 118,753 unaffiliated/other. Though a Democrat, Peters won over Republican and independent voters by <a href="http://www.scottpeters.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighting</a> his reform efforts as San Diego’s first City Council President.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Peters reached out to independent minded voters. He had an impressive list of&nbsp;endorsements, from former president Bill Clinton, to recently declared independent Nathan Fletcher.</p>

<p>Peters’ campaign outspent Bilbray $1,367,506.99 to $263,284.33.&nbsp;Peters' success is also due, in part, to the efforts of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s <a href="http://www.dccc.org/pages/redtoblue" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red to Blue</a> campaign, which identifies and targets districts that can feasibly change from Republican to Democratic control.</p>

<p>During his tenure in San Diego City Council, Paters led the creation of the strong-mayor form of government. He added an independent budget review committee, created an independent audit function, and hired San Diego’s first independent budget analyst.</p>
