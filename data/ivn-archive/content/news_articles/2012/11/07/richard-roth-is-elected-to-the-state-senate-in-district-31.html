<p>Richard Roth wins in SD 31 with 53 percent of the vote. His opponent Jeff Miller collected 46 percent of the vote with 100 percent of precincts reporting. The race opposed Republican Assembly Member Jeff Miller and Democrat Richard Roth in the newly redistricted 31st district.</p>

<p>This Senate race has been of major importance as it is one of the few races that will determine if the Democrats reach the <a href="http://www.pe.com/local-news/politics/jim-miller-headlines/20121102-31st-senate-district-race-on-pace-to-be-state-s-most-expensive.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer">27&nbsp;super majority</a>&nbsp;which would give them the power to override the Governor and the House on taxes and other issues. As the republicans and the democrats are nearly tied in terms of voter registrations, the outcome has been uncertain all along the campaign.</p>

<p>Because of its importance this race is one of, if not the, most expensive&nbsp;legislative&nbsp;contest this year with close to <a href="http://www.pe.com/local-news/politics/jim-miller-headlines/20121102-31st-senate-district-race-on-pace-to-be-state-s-most-expensive.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer">$8 millions</a>.&nbsp;All the money paid for the waves of mailers, TV ads, and radio ads necessary to convince the voters to go one side or the other.</p>
