<p>After a long wait for the results, Democrat Tammy Baldwin won the Wisconsin Senatorial race with 52 percent of the vote, beating out Republican Tommy Thompson by 7 percentage points.</p>

<p>Wisconsin was the center of a fierce fight for the the Senate seat between Baldwin and Thompson. Both were trying to replace long time<a href="http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/baldwin-thompson-each-hope-for-final-boost-from-visits-by/article_0cbf7110-252c-11e2-bf09-001a4bcf887a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Senator Herb Kohl</a>, who is retiring, in a seat that has been held by the Democrats since 1957. The seat was highly disputed, as the winner will&nbsp;influence who will control the Senate.</p>

<p>This seat was supposed to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/us/politics/in-wisconsin-senate-race-partisan-lines-draw-near.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">an easy pick</a> for the Republicans, since Republican Governor Scott Walker won a recall election a few months ago. Additionally, Vice Presidential hopeful Paul Ryan calls the state home. After being behind in the polls for months, Democrat Tammy Baldwin came back strong and led in the last polls before Election Day by 3 points.</p>

<p>For the most part, the two candidates remained steadfast to party lines. Tammy Baldwin has been a strong backer of President Obama's policies, while Tommy Thompson has been vocal&nbsp;against the Democrat administration, especially on Obamacare. Both, however, advocated themselves as the <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/10/29/tommy-thompson-and-tammy-baldwin-fighting-for-independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">champion of the middle class</a> in order to win the votes of independent, middle class voters.</p>

This led to negative campaign tacticts that have turned off some voters. Neither <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_PAWI_1103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">candidate is, indeed, particularly liked</a>, as Thompson only enjoys a 44/48&nbsp;favorability&nbsp;rating and Baldwin has a 44/50.</p>

<p><a href="http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/about/biography.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tammy Baldwin</a>, 50, has been representing Wisconsin's 2nd Congressional District in the House of Representative since she was elected in 1999.
