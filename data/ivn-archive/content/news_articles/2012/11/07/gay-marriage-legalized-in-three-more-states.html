<p>32 states have previously put the right for same-sex couples to receive civil marriages to a popular vote, and 32 times the measures were voted down. Yesterday, however, three states became the first to successfully pass ballot measures to make gay marriage legal: Maryland, Maine, and Washington.</p>

<p>Maryland’s proposition passed with close approval, at 52%. The measure’s passage is consistent with pre-election <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/samesex-marriage-favored-maryland-likely-voters/2012/10/18/913e11fa-1918-11e2-ad4a-e5a958b60a1e_page.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">polling</a>. The Maryland State legislature <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/197309/maryland-governor-martin-omalley-to-sign-civil-marriage-protection-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved</a> same-sex marriage in February of 2012, leaving it to be implemented if approved in a voter referendum. The bill will take affect on the first day of 2013.</p>

<p>Maine’s measure passed with a more comfortable margin, but remained close with 53% voting “yes” and 46% voting “no.” Like Maryland’s, the results were consistent with <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_ME_1102.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">polling</a> which found a slight majority of Mainers in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. Unlike in Maryland, Maine’s initiative did not <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2011/07/01/gay_marriage_supporters_plan_referendum_in_maine/?camp=pm" rel="noopener noreferrer">start as legislation</a>.</p>

<p>Washington’s legislation passed with 51% of the vote. Similar to the process in Maryland, Washington’s state legislature passed a law to make gay marriage legal only upon popular&nbsp;<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/06/anti-gay-marriage-measure-qualifies-for-wash-state-ballot/1#.T_FHarWe4j8" rel="noopener noreferrer">vote</a>. Unlike in the other two states, <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_WA_1103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">polling</a> in Washington indicated a more comfortable support for the measure.</p>

<p>The 2012 elections will be remembered for many things. Outside of the focus on the presidential race, the country appears to have arrived at a turning point in the battle for marriage equality. Putting same-sex legalization measures to a popular vote used to be a surefire strategy for defeating the law. But it appears that the tide is turning.</p>

<p><em>Editors Note: An additional measure, to define marriage as between a man and a woman, failed in Minnesota. Marriage equality activists see this as a <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/11/06/same-sex-marriage-legal-in-maryland-and-maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth victory for the movement</a>.</em></p>
