<p>Prop 32 results are in and California voters have decided not to pass the campaign finance reform measure with 56 percent of voters deciding No.</p>

<p>Proposition 32 was an attempt to limit money in politics for state and local elections. The measure would have banned employee payroll deductions to be used for political purposes. Corporations, public and private labor unions, and government contractors would not be able to make donations directly to political candidates.</p>

<p>Prop 32 would have changed the political climate of California by changing current finance rules:</p>
<blockquote>Current campaign finance laws in California limit individual and group contributions to $26,000 for gubernatorial candidates and $3,900 for state legislative candidates.</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kcet.org/news/ballotbrief/elections2012/propositions/whos-funding-prop-32-prohibiting-contributions-through-payroll-deductions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">total funding for the "Yes" campaign</a>&nbsp;totalled approximately $70 million. Notable donors were Charles T. Munger Jr. ($50 million), Arizona's PAC Americans for Responsible Leadership ($11 million), and the American Future Fund ($4.08 million).</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kcet.org/news/ballotbrief/elections2012/propositions/whos-funding-prop-32-prohibiting-contributions-through-payroll-deductions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">total funding for the "No" campaign</a>&nbsp;also totalled approximately $70 million. Notable donors were the California Teacher's Association ($22 million), California State Council of Service Employees Issues Committee&nbsp;($8.34 million), and two AFL-CIO organizations ($7.3 million combined). The latest spending reports relate to expenditures made before October 30, since then the spending has likely accelerated, although reports are not due until after the election in California.</p>

<p>Numbers for expenditures were reported by KCET on October 30.</p>

<p>While limiting the power of direct donations, Proposition 32 does not affect money given to Super PACs or political parties. Money will have to be spent without the coordination of the candidate but is unlimited in its amount.</p>

<p>Proponents of Proposition 32 claim to cut the tie between "special interests" and politicians whereas opponents claimed that the measure would <a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/2012/10/17/prop-32-and-the-rule-of-unintended-consequences/" rel="noopener noreferrer">generate loopholes</a> and the same money indirectly through parties or other organizations.</p>

<p>We will not see how Proposition 32 would have affected the future of politics.</p>
