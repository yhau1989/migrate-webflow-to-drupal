<p>Did you know that the word gay was used in connection to homosexuality for the first time in 1936.</p>

<p>In 1957, for the time in the US the number of men and women voting was approximately&nbsp;equal.</p>

<p>In 1967, Thurgood Marshall became the first the African-American US Supreme Court Justice.</p>

<p>These are only 3 examples among many others.
