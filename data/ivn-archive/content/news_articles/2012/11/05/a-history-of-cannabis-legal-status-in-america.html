<p>On November 6, voters will decide the next chapter of hemp’s ever changing legal status in America. With marijuana-related measures on the ballot in six states, federal and state laws will come to a head should any of these initiatives pass.</p>

<p>From Jamestown colony’s law requiring settlers grow hemp in 1619, to the <a href="http://www.theweedblog.com/creator-of-medical-marijuana-in-the-united-states-releases-new-book/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ratification</a> of Proposition 215 by California voters in 1996, cannabis has had its name and legality changed numerous times since before the United States of America was a country.</p>

<p>Below is a brief legal history of cannabis in the USA. How would you vote if a measure to legalize marijuana was proposed on your state ballot next week?</p>
