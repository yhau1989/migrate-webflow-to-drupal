The Holiday of Lights display in Del Mar, located in the fairgrounds. Starting on November 22 and running until January 1, 2013 the Holiday of Lights display will be a great site for all to see, and is the largest animated drive through light show on the west coast. The set up for all of these typically begins one month prior to the light display's beginning.</p>

<p>The Holiday show has over 400 brillant holiday light displays that are themed especially for the holiday season. Many of the holiday favorites are on display including Toyland, Twelve Days of Christmas, Elves at Play, Candy Cane Lane, San Diego County Fair, Treasures by the Lake, and the Del Mar Racetrack. The one and a half mile route enables vistors to see the lights through the comfort of their own car while enjoying the festive music. The Holiday Show of Lights offers alternatives to driving, offering a hayride - which is only available on Friday November 23 and 30, December 7 and 14, which runs from 5:30 to 9:30pm. Last year saw over 21,000 vehicles drive through the Fairgrounds and an additional 1,900 people partaking in the Holiday Hayride.</p>

<p>The Holiday of Lights in Del Mar is an activity that can be enjoyed by all ages and will be a delight for the whole family.</p>
