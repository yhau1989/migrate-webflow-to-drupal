<p>California State Parks have perpetuated in a state of disarray during the course of 2012 with the announcement that many will be closed, then remain open, and now will have a new director. Retired Major General Anthony Jackson of Fallbrook will take the place of Janelle Beland who has sat as the Acting Director of California Parks following the resignation of Ruth Coleman.</p>

<p>Prior to her resignation, the Director of California Parks had <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/State-parks-director-resigns-amid-surplus-scandal-3723294.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">buried</a> $54 million in surplus funds over the course of twelve years amidst the potential closure of 70 state parks. The department was set to have $22 million scrapped from their budget and force the closure of one fourth of California’s State Parks.</p>

<p>Gov. Brown also <a href="http://www.redding.com/news/2012/nov/07/endangered-state-parks-in-north-state-could-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnered</a> with private groups and local governments to raise enough funds to keep 65 of the California State Parks that were slated for closure <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/california-state-parks-closure_n_1635713.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">open</a> for visitors.</p>

<p>The Major General will take the helm of the system controlling California’s 278 State Parks amid a one third reduction in the annual budget for the program.</p>
