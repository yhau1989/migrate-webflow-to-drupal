<p>The Commons Bar, formerly known as The Lincoln Room on 4th &amp; E, &nbsp;is now under new ownership with first-time restaurateur Jake Pescatello and Dirty Birds owner Leigh Gibson. The Common's renovated the former Lincoln room to create an open atmosphere that provides customers with TV's and a game room upstairs. The menu has many similarities to that of Dirty Birds, especially when it comes to the wings, as Gibson is known as San Diego's wing master. Her wings were named Top ten Wings in American by thedailymeal.com and Yahoo Sports.</p>

<p>"It was the location that really spurred the interest for me, What really made it an exciting concept is the development of Horton Plaza park. We were mindful of creating something that was cohesive with the park and making it something very unpretentious," said restaurateur Jake Pescatello.</p>

<p>Their menu includes options of burgers, cheesy sandwiches, salads, hotdogs, wings, and many more appetizing bar classics. Standard starters include Mac 'n' Cheese Balls with jalapenos and bacon, and are breaded with fried and spicy cheese sauce. Wing sauce choices include BBQ, Spicy Ranch, Drunken Garlic, Volcanic Honey Mustard, Dog Daze Buffalo,Teriyaki and if you are craving something hot&nbsp;eat the Wicked Hot wing.</p>

<p>The Common's Bar will be hosting THE event for Movember &nbsp;on Wednesday November 14th starting at 6PM, which is sponsored by the San Diego Bugle. The Common's will be serving up special Mo cocktails and half-off chicken wings all night. You will not want to miss out on the hundreds of dollars worth of doors prizes and special appearances by the 2011 San Diego Man of Movember.</p>
