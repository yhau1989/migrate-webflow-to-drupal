<p><img alt="" height="256" src="cloudinary://this-week-and-the-future-of-ivn-47726.jpg" title="writersportal" width="600">In less than a year, IVN has become a national platform and outlet for news and information built specifically for independent-minded people. In that time, the IVN community has grown to over 28,000 Facebook Fans, almost 4,000 Twitter followers, and over 200 individuals and independent contributors from all over the political and geographic maps. And&nbsp;during the week of the election, over 600,000 people visited IVN.</p>

<p>As a member of the IVN community, we want to thank you all for your support and kind words as we develop what is a very unique platform. Post election, we will focus on our attention on the issues that are given little or no attention elsewhere, but have significant impact on the lives of everyday Americans. And, we encourage you all to participate in the dialogue by contributing journalistic quality articles and providing your feedback through comments and social sharing.</p>

<p>On a technical level, the foundation for a broad independent news and information network, aimed at reducing the barriers to participation in the public discourse, have been&nbsp;set. Now, our operations will set focus on refining the platform for ease of use, expansion, and increased functionality. We will be excited to share these features and developments in the coming months.</p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of IVN and please contact us anytime with comments, questions, concerns, or feedback.</p>

<p>-The IVN Team, contact@ivn.us</p>
