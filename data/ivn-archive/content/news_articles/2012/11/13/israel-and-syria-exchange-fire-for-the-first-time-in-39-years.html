<p>Israeli tanks shot and scored direct hits on Syrian's artillery units on Monday November 12th in reaction to mortal shells coming from Syria that reached&nbsp;Israeli&nbsp;positions on the Golan Heights. This is the first time since 1973 that Israel and Syria exchange fire.</p>

<p>Israel took&nbsp;possession&nbsp;of the Golan Heights, at the time a Syrian territory, during the 1967 Six Day War. Israel confirmed its control of the plateau after violent fights in the 1973 <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2012/11/11/tirs-de-sommation-israeliens-contre-la-syrie_1788941_3218.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yom Kippur War</a>. The Golan Heights have since been considered of&nbsp;strategic&nbsp;importance for military reasons as well as for its water&nbsp;resources.</p>

<p>Even if officially Israel and Syria are still at war, the two countries have not fought since 1979. While remaining&nbsp;enemies, each of the two countries had reasons to avoid confrontation. <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2012/11/12/tirs-de-la-syrie-sur-le-plateau-du-golan-plus-un-message-politique-qu-une-attaque-contre-israel_1789359_3218.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syria</a> has built its regional influence as a defender of the&nbsp;Palestinian cause without intervening&nbsp;militarily&nbsp;as Syria aims at being a peace and stability actor in the Middle East. From&nbsp;Israel's stand point, the Bashar-Al Assad regime, being an ally of Iran and supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas is a known enemy.</p>

<p>The recent tension between the two countries happened after mortar shells from Syria landed on the Golan Heights, without causing casualties. The origin of the shot remains unclear as the Syrian army and the rebels were fighting in the border region. After the first shot, Israel first reacted with warning shots on Sunday and before firing shot at Syrian's units on Monday as more mortal shells were fired during the night.</p>

<p>Differing analyses have been made as to the significance of these incidents. Some might wonder if this means that Syria's civil war is spilling on&nbsp;neighboring&nbsp;countries and dragging Israel into it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20302503" rel="noopener noreferrer">Israel's military&nbsp;and political leaders</a> affirm the contrary and that this warning is meant to say that Israel will not accept any additional shelling whether&nbsp;deliberate&nbsp;or accidental on its territory.</p>

The mortal shots on the Golan are a clear political message, in his opinion, showing that a front that has been at peace for the last 40 years is now&nbsp;endangered&nbsp;by the Syrian revolution. However, he believes that, like with Turkey, it will not go further as the Assad regime does not have the capacity to escalate an international conflict.</p>
