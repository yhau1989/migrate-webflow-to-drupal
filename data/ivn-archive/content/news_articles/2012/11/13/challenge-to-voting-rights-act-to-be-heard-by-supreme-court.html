<p>The Supreme Court has granted cert. in the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/shelby-county-v-holder/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelby County v. Holder</a>, a suit filed regarding an Alabama county and its relation to the Voting Rights Act. The challenge points to a provision in the law that requires states with a history of racial bias to seek permission <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20277729" rel="noopener noreferrer">before</a> changing their voting laws from either the US Attorney General or a three-judge panel of the District Court of the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>The Voting Rights Act was initially passed in 1965 as a plank of a larger overhaul of civil rights legislation. The heat of the law addresses discriminatory voting practices that disenfranchised African American citizens. Since 1965 the Act has <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/take_action/download_resources/vraflier.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended</a> protection to voters whose English proficiency can be a barrier to voting, prohibits purging voter rolls of voters who did not participate in the last election, and ensures that voters who appear at a poll can participate without an ID if they sign an affidavit.</p>

<p>The particular provision that will be <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/12-00096qp.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> before the court is: Whether Congress' Decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the fourteenth and fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution.</p>

<p>Section 4(b) requires that the new voting rules within covered <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/covered.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">jurisdictions</a> must be precleared by the Attorney General or the three-judge panel in a District Court in the District of Columbia. Some states are covered as a whole, including Alabama.</p>

<p>The challenge comes in the wake of an election where minority voters played a determinative role in national leadership and where several states attempted to implement voting <a href="http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/voter/voteridlaw.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictions</a> that would fall especially hard on minority groups.</p>

<p>Advocates of the Voting Rights Act provision point to states that are implementing new election rules that make voting more difficult, including for minority groups. These practices <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/171199/why-we-still-need-section-5-voting-rights-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a> voter ID laws, abbreviated early voting periods, and disenfranchising ex-felons.</p>

<p>Article I Sec. 4 of the Constitution <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article01/" rel="noopener noreferrer">declares</a> that “the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.”</p>

<p>Opponents of the Voting Rights Act argue that the federal law oversteps the bounds of Article I Sec. 4 and that the provisions are redundant as the 10<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> Amendments provide ample protection to minority groups from discriminatory voting practices and leave the States the authority to decide how elections will be conducted within their borders.</p>

<p>The case sprung from a local redistricting effort carried out in Shelby county that may have played a role in the defeat of the sole African-American incumbent on city council in Calera, AL.</p>

<p>Oral arguments will likely be heard in early 2013 with a decision in the early summer.</p>
