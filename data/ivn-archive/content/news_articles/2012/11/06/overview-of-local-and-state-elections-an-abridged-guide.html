With a tense election day ahead, the city and state are anxiously awaiting their next leaders, and since there are so many candidates on the ballot, IVN San Diego has provided the an abridged guide for key races for San Diego.</p>

<p><span><strong>Mayor of San Diego</strong></span></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong></strong>Bob Filner (D) vs. Carl DeMaio (R)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://filner.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filner</a> is the incumbent congressman, looking to expand the port, all the while promising to rebuild the city's numerous neighborhoods, place an emphasis on K-12 education, and foster a "blue economy" as a job solution. Filner has been particularly crucial of DeMaio, for his lack of substantial voting on key issues, as well as catering to special interest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carldemaio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeMaio</a> is the city council member that leans on his experience as a businessman, and champions his work with Proposition B pension reform. DeMaio further looks to increase tourism, and favors the expansion of the convention center. The council member has been an active participant in a tit-for-tat of personal attack ads towards Filner, criticizing him for extensive travel junkets and failed pension plans.</p>

<p><strong></strong><span><strong>33rd US Congressional District </strong></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Henry Waxman (D) vs. William Bloomfield (I)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://waxman.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waxman</a> is a veteran politician and liberal Democrat who has served in both the California and US Assembly intermittently since 1975.&nbsp; His last bid for office resulted in his 2003 election to the 30th Congressional district; the position of which he is the incumbent. True to his party, Waxman's campaign website reads of the collapsed economy:&nbsp; "Congressman Waxman believes the top priority for this Congress should be putting America back to work. When President Obama was sworn into office, our country was facing the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression."</p>

<p>Bloomfield is the Independent candidate who aims to eliminate trillion dollar deficits, reform No Child Left Behind, and "rebuild America's economic engine." The Independent's first bid for public office, he want to "fix what's wrong with Congress."</p>

<p>"We will need to change Congress by sending people to Capitol Hill who are not vested in the special interests that obstruct reform, but, just as importantly, are willing to do whatever it takes to change the system to allow the solutions to our nation’s problems to be implemented," reads Bloomfield's campaign site.</p>

<p><span><strong>39th California Senate District</strong></span></p>
<ul>

</ul>

His platform entails "getting San Diegans back to work," pension reform, and the stimulation of the economy.

</ul>
<p><a href="http://sd40.senate.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vargas</a>, the incumbent senator representing California's 40th District, also serves on San Diego City Council. In a strangely political turn of events, Vargas had raised funds heavily promoting Crimmins as a Republican candidate, even though he is a Democrat. This was to ensure that Crimmins would garner enough votes, so Vargas had a better shot advancing in the primaries.</p>

<p>A veteran Marine Corps Officer for over two decades, <a href="http://www.crimminsforcongress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimmins</a> understands the relationship between the city and its large military population. Crimmins campaign site elaborates hi tance on the economy:</p>
<blockquote>"I believe in the American Dream and the free market. No nation has ever taxed itself out of a recession or into prosperity. I recognize that lowering taxes will spur economic growth. Raising taxes will only serve to hurt small businesses, hinder economic growth and increase the unemployment rate."</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.scottpeters.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peters</a>, an economist, has served as Diego’s first City Council President, where he encouraged greater accountability and efficiency in government.&nbsp; Keeping up with trends, his campaign has focused on the well being of veterans, as well as praising the President in the realm of healthcare reform.
