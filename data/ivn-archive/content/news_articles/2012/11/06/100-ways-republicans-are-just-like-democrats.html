<p>There is a widely-held perception that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are drastically different in their policy, proposals, philosophy of government, and general modus operandi. While there are certainly some significant differences between the two parties, the number of similarities are astounding. A few months ago on IVN, <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/17/100-ways-mitt-romney-is-just-like-barack-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wes Messamore explored</a> the similarities between the two major party candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.</p>

<p><strong> [heading title="100 Ways Republicans Are Just Like Democrats" subtitle="Here’s a look at the broader similarities between the Democratic and Republican parties:"] </strong></p>

<p>1. A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/s230" rel="noopener noreferrer">large</a> <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/vote/2011/h/932" rel="noopener noreferrer">number</a> of Democrats and Republicans signed the National Defense Authorization Act for the year 2012, which critics say allows for the indefinite detention of American citizens on U.S. soil without due process. President Obama <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/3234/ndaa-another-broken-promise-by-president-barack-obama-and-an-attack-on-civil-liberties" rel="noopener noreferrer">pledged</a>&nbsp;to veto the NDAA, but went back on his word and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/02/president-obama-signed-the-national-defense-authorization-act-now-what/" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed</a>&nbsp;it into law with the indefinite detention provision included. Mitt Romney&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1yY3NCiMVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a>&nbsp;that he would do the same.</p>

[outset type="half"][/outset]<p><a href="http://endpartisanship.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="onetwothree.v2" height="280" src="cloudinary://governor-cuomo-wants-publicly-funded-campaigns-new-york-46364.gif" width="336"></a></p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/577671-republican-keynesians-need-to-come-out-of-the-closet" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans and Democrats</a> overwhelmingly favor Keynesian economics rather than other schools of economic thought such as the <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2012/02/16/keynes-vs-hayek-oversimplified" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austrian School</a> of economics.</p>

<p>3. The Bush-era Patriot Act, which allows for warrantless wiretapping, was passed with <a href="http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/7877#.UHxfU6mPWSo" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan</a>&nbsp;support and recently&nbsp;<a href="http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/senate/1/84" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended</a> by policymakers of both parties.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaXfwuGmxg&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney</a>&nbsp;has voiced his support for the controversial legislation. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patriot-act-extension-signed-into-law-despite-bipartisan-resistance-in-congress/2011/05/27/AGbVlsCH_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama</a>&nbsp;supported it as a senator and signed the extension into law as president.</p>

<p>4. Both the Republican and Democratic administrations have attempted to justify the use of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cfr.org/counterterrorism/targeted-killings/p9627" rel="noopener noreferrer">extrajudicial</a>&nbsp;targeted killing, the killing of people without trial or substantive due process, including American citizens. The use of these tactics <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/obama-drone-wars-normalisation-extrajudicial-killing" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased</a>&nbsp;under President Obama and has received&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-presidential-primary/184813-romney-perry-congratulate-obama-perry-gives-backhanded-praise" rel="noopener noreferrer">praise</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/02/dick-liz-cheney-obama-awlaki-apology_n_991062.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">from</a>&nbsp;members of both parties. There was strong&nbsp;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/03/bipartisan-approval-targeted-killing" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan</a>&nbsp;support for the Obama Administration's extrajudicial killing of U.S. citizen&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/30/awlaki-killed-american-cl_n_988929.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anwar al-Aulaqi</a>&nbsp;and his 16 year old son without trial, which received praise from Republican Party&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/30/washington-praises-killing-al-awlaki/" rel="noopener noreferrer">members</a>&nbsp;and was strongly&nbsp;<a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/10/03/8130791-romney-forcefully-defends-killing-of-al-awlaki?lite" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a>&nbsp;by Mitt Romney.</p>

<p>5. The Democratic and Republican parties both generally support the vastly-growing use of unmanned aerial combat drones in the Middle East:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The use of unmanned drones to patrol foreign skies, which have been <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/timeglider/" rel="noopener noreferrer">responsible</a>&nbsp;for many civilian and child deaths, began under&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/the-bush-years-2004-2009/" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Bush</a>&nbsp;and drone use has drastically&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased</a>&nbsp;and expanded under President Obama. There has been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/09/drones" rel="noopener noreferrer">little</a>&nbsp;to no partisan opposition to these tactics and while the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012GOPPlatform.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOP platform</a>&nbsp;advocates for increased drone use, the Democratic&nbsp;<a href="http://assets.dstatic.org/dnc-platform/2012-National-Platform.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform</a>&nbsp;doesn't mention their use at all.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/drone-war-admission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drone warfare</a> in Pakistan started under Bush, has been significantly escalated by Obama, and Romney has&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/F2gCv_nOvrI" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicated</a>&nbsp;that he will continue using drones in Pakistan if elected. Both parties also support the continued drone warfare being&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/libya-drone-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer">used</a>&nbsp;in Libya, which&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/26/nader-obama-is-a-war-criminal-but-romney-would-be-worse/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney</a>&nbsp;has stated he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/06/06/pawlenty-obamas-drone-strikes-dont-go-far-enough/" rel="noopener noreferrer">would</a>&nbsp;likely continue.</li>
	<li>In Yemen, the Obama Administration has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/foreign-affairs-defense/al-qaeda-in-yemen/interactive-map-americas-war-in-yemen/" rel="noopener noreferrer">continued</a>&nbsp;the fighting that the Bush Administration&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/international/middleeast/02MILI.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">initiated</a>, which Obama has done with the use of secretive drone warfare and by&nbsp;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-notifies-congress-troops-sent-libya-yemen-182602336--election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently</a>&nbsp;sending troops back.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Both parties will also allow drones to patrol the skies of the United States. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr658" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012</a>, which calls for the use of up to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/7/coming-to-a-sky-near-you/?page=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">30,000</a>&nbsp;drones in U.S. airspace, passed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/s15" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate</a>&nbsp;with overwhelming bipartisan support.</p>

<p>7. The Federal Reserve is allowed by both parties to continue to operate as an "<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12799.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent</a> government agency," whose monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president nor any other elected member of the executive or legislative branch.&nbsp;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was appointed by George W. Bush and re-appointed by Obama. Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on whether he would reappoint Bernanke, stating in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/Governor/Massachusetts/Mitt_Romney/Views/The_Federal_Reserve/" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010</a>&nbsp;that he would reappoint him, but stating <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/24/business/la-fi-mo-bernanke-romney-federal-reserve-chairman-20120824" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently</a>&nbsp;that he would not reappoint Bernanke for a third term. Bernanke was reappointed for his second term in 2010 after a <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/double-whopper-no-beef/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan</a> vote of 70-30. However, the Audit the Fed bill has also received strong&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/audit-the-fed-bill-set-for-house-vote/2012/07/24/gJQAJypU7W_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan support</a>.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;In an apparent direct conflict of interest, 130 Republican and Democratic congressional members have invested in company stocks while making legislative decisions that impact those same companies.</p>

9. [social_link quote="Democrats and Republicans both played a role in the founding of the Federal Reserve." hyperlink="http://a.ivn.us/UfPNz8" handle="" hashes=""] Initial versions of the Federal Reserve Act were drafted by Republican Senator&nbsp;<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Aldrich" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nelson Aldrich</a>&nbsp;and the final version was drafted y Democratic Congressman&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Glass" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carter Glass</a>&nbsp;of Virginia, which then went to receive <a href="http://www.llsdc.org/FRA-LH/" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong bipartisan support</a> in Congress.</p>

<p>10. Both Republican and Democrats have allowed the Federal Reserve to inject <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/StreetTalk/Springer-fight-Fed-rise/2012/10/02/id/458344" rel="noopener noreferrer">trillions</a> of <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/01/343-trillion-counting" rel="noopener noreferrer">dollars</a> into the economy through their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/quantitative-easing-and-the-electronic-money-printing-machine-—-saying-goodbye-to-historically-low-mortgage-interest-rates-federal-reserve-95-percent-complete-on-buying-1-25-trillion-in-mor/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quantitative</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/finance-economics/core-finance/v/quantitative-easing" rel="noopener noreferrer">easing</a>&nbsp;programs. While many Republicans including Romney have said they are against the third round of quantitative easing, neither party has or is likely to introduce bills aimed at regulating or halting quantitative easing altogether.</p>

<p>11.&nbsp;Republicans and Democrats love earmarks so much that even the bipartisan earmark moratorium, while greatly cutting back on earmarks,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/congress-has-still-found-ways-to-pass-earmarks-despite-ban-heres-how-and-a-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer">couldn't stop</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/2472-House-Getting-Creative-With-the-Earmark-Moratorium" rel="noopener noreferrer">pork</a> from being <a href="http://www.cagw.org/reports/pig-book/2012/" rel="noopener noreferrer">slipped</a> into bills. Approved earmarks in <a href="http://endingspending.com/fixing-the-budget/earmarks/map/" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010</a> totaled over $15 billion and the amount of requested earmarks in <a href="http://endingspending.com/fixing-the-budget/earmarks/map-2011/" rel="noopener noreferrer">2011</a> exceeded $129 billion. Citizens Against Government Waste <a href="http://www.cagw.org/reports/pig-book/2012/2012-pig-book.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that $3.3 billion has been approved for 2012.</p>

<p>12. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Both&nbsp;parties</a> and their national, congressional and senatorial committees have spent more than one billion dollars on their 2012 campaigns.</p>

<p>13. The Democratic and Republican convention committees each&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/fecrecord/december2011/conventionfunding2012.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a>&nbsp;$17,689,800 from the U.S. Treasury for their conventions in 2012 and an additional $600,000 to cover the cost of inflation. This is paid for through a voluntary check off on federal income tax forms.</p>

<p>14. Both parties are largely <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">backed</a> by the same&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/sectorall.php?cycle=2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate</a>&nbsp;contributors and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest</a>&nbsp;groups. Congressional members also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">receive</a>&nbsp;contributions from many of the same interest groups. Both parties are heavily <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">lobbied</a> by <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com/10-of-the-biggest-lobbies-in-washington/" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate</a> America -- to the tune of $3.3 billion in 2011 and $1.68 billion thus far in 2012.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Both parties are largely backed by the same corporate contributors and interest groups. " hyperlink="http://a.ivn.us/UfPNz8" handle="" hashes=""] 15. The majority of both parties agreed that Wall Street should receive bailouts. The TARP bailout was signed into law by&nbsp;<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program" rel="noopener noreferrer">George W. Bush</a>&nbsp;and initially drafted by Bush-appointed Secretary of Treasury-- and Republican-- Henry Paulson. Obama <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2009/12/08/obama_supporting_tarp_in_2008_step_up_and_do_whats_right.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> TARP as a senator and the bailout went on to receive overwhelming support from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/h26" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrats</a>&nbsp;in the House. TARP also received largely&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep2008/bail-s24.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan</a>&nbsp;support in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/110-2008/s213" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate</a>.</p>

<p>16. The same&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/02/tarp-recipients-paid-out-114-m.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street TARP recipients</a>&nbsp;who were top contributors to the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic</a> presidential campaign in 2008 are now the top contributors backing the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00000286" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a>&nbsp;presidential campaign in 2012. In 2008, Republican&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/summary.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00006424" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McCain</a>&nbsp;was backed by the same companies, although his campaign received less than the Obama campaign.</p>
<blockquote>Both parties work hard to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/judge-napolitano/what-if-elections-don-t-matter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintain</a>&nbsp;the illusion of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8pxyAWTBk" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-party system</a>, but in reality they both serve the interests of the business party.</blockquote>
[pullout_blockquote quote="20. The Democratic and Republican parties have both sued third parties to prevent them from appearing on the ballot in key states." author=""] 17. Both parties are private, non-profit corporations and are in no way an official part of the United States government. Furthermore, neither party is mentioned in the Constitution nor is there mention of a two-party system, and a few of our <p><a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-04/opinion/avlon.independents.day_1_independent-voters-party-political-debates?_s=PM:OPINION" rel="noopener noreferrer">founding</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iHpfjCoA1_wC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=did+james+madison+fear+parties&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L0Pg4-ZTag&amp;sig=tneoB8nc1DP-ZSJE5JdS-hopvLc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CQmHUIjSCJS60QGX3oGADg&amp;ved=0CGwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=did%20james%20madison%20fear%20parties&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">fathers</a> expressed concerns regarding the emergence of a rival two-party system.</p>

<p>18. As Glenn Greenwald&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/third-party-us-presidential-debate-deceit" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out in an article</a>&nbsp;for The Guardian, Republicans and Democrats discuss certain <a href="http://reason.com/reasontv/2012/10/15/split-between-little-differences-matt-we" rel="noopener noreferrer">general issues</a> during debates while ignoring other more controversial issues that they may agree on, hoping to convince the public that there is a huge difference of choice.</p>

<p>19. Both Democrats and Republicans seem to believe that voting for a third party is equivalent to throwing away your vote while in reality, if everyone voted their conscience and avoided voting for the "lesser of two evils," which <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/july_2012/46_will_be_voting_for_lesser_of_two_evils_this_presidential_election" rel="noopener noreferrer">46 percent</a> of those polled said they would be doing this election, the two-party stranglehold may actually be broken.</p>

<p>20. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A626-2004Jun23.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic</a> and <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/12731-gop-suing-to-keep-third-parties-off-ballot-in-november" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a> parties have <a href="http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/9/15/153818.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">both</a> <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/14389/republican-use-dirty-tricks-crack-down-on-ron-paul-and-gary-johnson-in-state-courts" rel="noopener noreferrer">sued</a> <a href="http://chippewa.com/news/article_914887ce-1c07-5a53-9184-7fbaf565a84f.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">third</a> parties to prevent them from appearing on the ballot in key states.</p>

<p>21. Both the Democratic and Republican parties <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/16794/jill-stein-arrest-why-the-cpd-shutting-out-third-party-candidates-like-gary-johnson-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer">exclude</a> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122861&amp;page=1#.UIgv8GfcyYo" rel="noopener noreferrer">third</a> <a href="http://opendebates.org/theissue/exclusionofpop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">parties</a> from the presidential debates. In 1987, the Democratic and Republican parties founded the nonprofit <a href="http://www.opendebates.org/theissue/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> to regulate the presidential debates, which&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDQsIKbQLFY" rel="noopener noreferrer">excludes</a>&nbsp;third party candidates from participating in the only nationally televised presidential debates.</p>

<p>22. The Democratic and Republican parties have both been&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/common-sense/2012/09/23/gary-johnson-files-anti-trust-lawsuit-for-entry-to-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sued</a>&nbsp;for conspiring to exclude third parties from the quadrennial presidential debates.</p>

[advertisement]23. Both also both believe that taxpayers should provide funding to other countries around the world. The bipartisan&nbsp;<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Appropriations" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission on Appropriations</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=295910" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved</a>&nbsp;$40.1 billion in foreign aid for the 2013 year.</p>

<p>24. Both party platforms mention Israel, confirm Jerusalem as being the capital city, and both the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=033gCiurxbg&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/6dERXzPQo2U" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a> presidential candidate have pledged their allegiance to Israel.</p>

<p>25. The Democratic and Republican parties&nbsp;<a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/14111/obama-vs-romney-on-the-israel-palestine-two-state-solution-why-both-must-pledge-to-make-it-happen" rel="noopener noreferrer">both agree</a>&nbsp;that a two-state solution should be pursued between Israel and Palestine.</p>

<p>26. No one other than a Democrat or Republican has been elected president in the last 160 years.</p>

<p>27.&nbsp;Lawmakers from both parties in Congress and the executive branch have been responsible for all&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations#1850.E2.80.931859" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign interventions since 1853</a>, keeping America in a near perpetual state of war. They are also responsible for the assistance and direct involvement of the U.S. in at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions#During_the_Cold_War" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 instances</a> of covert foreign regime change since the beginning of the Cold War.</p>

<p>28. There is cross-administration support of preemptive cyber attacks. The Obama Administration has <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/230443-report-obama-bush-ordered-cyber-attacks-against-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer">continued</a> the Stuxnet cyber attacks against Iran which were started under the Bush Administration.</p>

<p>29. Sanctions against&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._sanctions_against_Iran" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iran</a>&nbsp;began under Carter and have received&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/104-1996/h250" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong</a>&nbsp;bipartisan support from every&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cfr.org/iran/lengthening-list-iran-sanctions/p20258" rel="noopener noreferrer">administration</a>&nbsp;since, continuing under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/obama-order-implements-iran-sanctions-approved-by-congress/2012/10/09/2536e40e-1266-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama</a>&nbsp;Administration.</p>

<p>30. Both Democrats and Republicans are&nbsp;eager&nbsp;to place <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/world/middleeast/obama-and-congress-in-step-over-iran-sanctions.html?pagewanted=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more sanctions</a> on Iran, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/iran-santions-suffering" rel="noopener noreferrer">which</a> <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-08/how-the-u-dot-s-dot-is-hurting-innocent-people-in-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer">harm</a> innocent Iranian civilians, hoping to prevent Iran from developing nukes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17511816" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight other countries</a>&nbsp;already have nukes is usually ignored.</p>

<p>31.

<p>40. The Bush Administration's use of torture through&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alfred-w-mccoy/extraordinary-rendition-torture_b_1775438.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">extraordinary rendition</a>, which is when prisoners are sent from CIA black sites to other countries where "information extraction" will be attempted, began after Clinton signed <a href="http://loc.gov/law/help/usconlaw/pdf/fisher_aulr57_5_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDD 39</a> and has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/obama-black-sites-rendition-torture_n_1812578.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">continued</a>&nbsp;under the Obama Administration.&nbsp;By failing to speak out or attempting to change these practices, Republicans and Democrats both allow for "enhanced interrogation techniques" -- such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation, hypothermia and stress positions, among others-- &nbsp;to be used to extract information from suspects. The Obama Administration even <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer" rel="noopener noreferrer">granted final immunity</a> to Bush's CIA torturers.</p>

Since the beginning&nbsp;of prohibition in 1937, no administration has attempted to legalize marijuana. &nbsp;Even though there is more <a href="http://beyondchronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Grannys-List-July-2012.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientific evidence</a> than ever indicating the benefits of marijuana, every administration has kept&nbsp;marijuana regulated under Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act. A Schedule I classification places marijuana in a stricter regulatory category than cocaine, labels it as having no medicinal benefit, and prohibits doctors from prescribing it. Hemp production, which <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/kentuckyhempstudy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">would</a> <a href="http://reason.org/news/show/1002979.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">provide</a> many <a href="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/ncnu02/v5-284.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">environmental and economic</a> benefits, continues to remain outlawed and ignored as well.</p>

<p>43.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmaE2Aez_XY" rel="noopener noreferrer">Both parties</a>&nbsp;rigged aspects of their 2012 conventions by using teleprompters with pre-loaded and predetermined vote outcomes, and then ignored overwhelming delegate dissent during voice votes.</p>

<p>44. Both parties generally ignore the fact that the United States has the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5xRCN8YmR" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?pagewanted=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">incarceration rate</a>&nbsp;per capital in the world with over half imprisoned for nonviolent drug use, and neither platform offers solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>46. The Bush Administration's Guantanamo Bay has remained open under Obama and although he did sign an executive order calling for the closing, the Senate, in an overwhelmingly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/s202" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan</a>&nbsp;effort, blocked the federal funding to ship the prisoners to Illinois. Obama then signed the federal fund-blocking bill into law when he could have vetoed. The Obama Administration has also imposed new <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/" rel="noopener noreferrer">arbitrary rules</a> for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-turns-back-the-clock-on-guantanamo/2012/08/16/e97f10c2-e62c-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">prisoners</a> and Romney has said that he would like to see it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Mitt_Romney_Homeland_Security.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">double</a>&nbsp;in size.</p>

<p>48. Under the Bush Administration, not one Senate member&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2001/s295" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a>&nbsp;against the bill that founded the&nbsp;Transportation&nbsp;Security&nbsp;Administration&nbsp;and the House displayed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2001/h448" rel="noopener noreferrer">overwhelming</a>&nbsp;support as well.

On the other hand, there has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_US_Congresspersons_who_support_or_oppose_SOPA/PIPA" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan support</a> for bills such as <a href="http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2011/10/technology-a-bipartisan-attempt-to-regulate-the-internet.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOPA</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIPA</a>, which critics such as <a href="http://www.google.com/takeaction/past-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Learn_more" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-sopa_n_1214090.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> say would allow severe internet regulation, censorship and provide the president with an "internet kill switch."</p>

Both the Republican and Democratic platform agree that the death penalty should remain in place, which&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcl-T0P7xYU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/romney-town-hall-crowd-applauds-death-penalt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney</a> also support.</p>

<p>62. Although&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150245/americans-swap-electoral-college-popular-vote.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">62 percent</a>&nbsp;of Americans polled said they want to get rid of electoral college in favor of a more direct approach to democracy, neither the Republican or Democratic Party present this as an option.</p>

<p>63. As Jon Stewart <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-june-16-2010/an-energy-independent-future" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out</a>, the last eight presidents have gone on television and pledged to move America toward an energy-independent future. In 2012, both party platforms as well as both&nbsp;<a href="http://www.c2es.org/publications/candidates-climate-energy-guide-key-policy-positions-president-obama-governor-romney#reducingoilimports" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney and Obama</a>&nbsp;pledge to bring America into a new era of energy independence.</p>

<p>64. Voter fraud paranoia is largely bipartisan. Voters belonging to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/10/poll-voter-fraud-paranoia-officially-bipartisan" rel="noopener noreferrer">both parties</a>&nbsp;are paranoid that the opposing party may be involved in voter fraud.</p>

<p>65. Political campaign advertisements from both parties have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/us/politics/obama-romney-and-a-campaign-of-attack-ads-political-memo.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">long</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/15/west.negative/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">focused</a>&nbsp;on attacking the other candidate in often misleading ways. Gary Johnson&nbsp;takes&nbsp;a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2XSwRU61YI" rel="noopener noreferrer">different</a> approach to campaign ads, deciding to not mention his opponent by name.</p>

<p>66. Americans of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/17/AR2010021701151.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">both parties</a>&nbsp;overwhelmingly oppose the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling that allows corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited amounts of money, in secret, on political campaigning.</p>

<p>67. Yet both the Republican and Democratic parties continue to heavily rely on the same&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">super PAC</a>&nbsp;funded campaign strategies permitted by the Citizens United ruling.</p>

<p>68. Both&nbsp;<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/07/27/5409/democrats-and-republicans-alike-are-exploiting-new-fundraising-loophole" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic and Republican</a>&nbsp;parties are exploiting loopholes that allow&nbsp;members of Congress and presidential candidates to assist super PACs in their fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>69. Among those&nbsp;<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/02/23/auto-bailout-now-backed-stimulus-divisive/" rel="noopener noreferrer">polled</a>, there is strong bipartisan support for Obama's Keystone Pipeline project, and the bill passed the House with strong <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/222349-house-gop-thwarting-obama-clears-highway-bill-with-oil-pipeline-mandate" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan support</a>. Romney has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJAl5nZTnXw" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicated</a> that he supports this project as well.</p>

<p>70. The Democratic and Republican parties refuse to ban contributions from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/influence/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporations and interest groups</a>, whereas the&nbsp;<a href="http://dissidentvoice.org/2008/12/refuse-corporate-donations-it-is-what-must-be-done/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Party</a>&nbsp;runs on a platform of refusing to accept corporate donations.</p>

<p>71. The two-party system continues to operate largely due to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/09/what-are-your-favored-electoral-reforms/" rel="noopener noreferrer">laws</a> and <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/america-needs-electoral-reform#" rel="noopener noreferrer">regulations</a> <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=candidate-selection-process" rel="noopener noreferrer">created</a> by the two parties, which severely limit and regulate the ability of third party candidates to gain traction and ballot access.</p>

<p>72. There has been&nbsp;<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2011/01/27/filibuster-reform-achieved-on-bipartisan-basis/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan</a>&nbsp;congressional support of filibuster reform.</p>

<p>73. Neither the Democratic or Republican Party are willing to address the <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/06/afghanistan-iraq-wars-killed-132000-civilians-report-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer">130,000</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3321" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;plus</a> Iraqi and Afghan civilian deaths that have happened as a result of the bipartisan Global War on Terror.</p>

<p>74. Republicans and Democrats are&nbsp;<a href="http://truth-out.org/news/item/11307-reforming-welfare-and-gutting-the-poor-a-bipartisan-platform" rel="noopener noreferrer">both responsible</a>&nbsp;for the gutting of the welfare system.</p>

<p>75. Presidential signing <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/signingstatements.php#q6" rel="noopener noreferrer">statements</a> have been a significant source of controversy, but have been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33667.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">employed</a>&nbsp;heavily by every administration since Reagan.</p>

<p>76.

<p>77. Both Republicans and Democrats are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/5839-bipartisan-support-stuxnet-drone-leaks-crackdown.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">concerned</a>&nbsp;about the public's knowledge of their use of drones and the use of cyber weapons against Iran.</p>

<p>78. In the 2012 presidential race, both the Democratic and Republican campaigns&nbsp;<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/04/mitt-romney-public-financing-presidential-campaign-/1#.UHpdqKmPWSo" rel="noopener noreferrer">have decided</a>&nbsp;to not spend taxpayer money on their campaigns.</p>

<p>79. Both parties act as if the <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2012/08/20/the-wrong-side-absolutely-must-not-win" rel="noopener noreferrer">other</a> <a href="http://www.lessgovisthebestgov.com/Mitt-Romney-Barack-Obama-blame-stops-here-America-wins.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">party</a> is the <a href="http://cincinnati.com/blogs/letters/2012/09/10/both-parties-play-the-blame-game/" rel="noopener noreferrer">worst</a> thing that has ever happened to America.</p>

<p>80. A new farm bill, which will finance dozens of price support and crop insurance programs for farmers and food assistance for low-income families, received&nbsp;<a href="http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/senate/2/164" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong bipartisan</a>&nbsp;support in the Senate.</p>

<p>81. Among those <a href="http://www.nature.org/newsfeatures/pressreleases/poll-conservation-is-patriotic-and-has-bipartisan-support.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">polled</a>, there is strong bipartisan agreement that conservatism is patriotic.</p>

<p>82.&nbsp;Federal term limits, which many say would be a huge step towards&nbsp;ending corruption in Washington, have been repeatedly <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/208395-senate-rejects-amendment-recommending-congressional-term-limit-" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/termlimits/stories/033095.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">through</a> bipartisan votes. In a poll conducted by <a href="http://pollposition.com/2012/01/09/support-term-limit-for-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pollposition.com</a>, 51 percent&nbsp;of those polled said they would support a one-term limit for members&nbsp;of the House and Senate.</p>

<p>83. Both parties largely believe that the government has the power and right to take private property for public use, and sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London" rel="noopener noreferrer">private</a> use, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain" rel="noopener noreferrer">eminent domain</a> <a href="http://prfamerica.org/speeches/7th/EminentDomainForPrivateGain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">laws</a>.</p>

<p>84. Both parties are responsible for continually <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=3423" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing</a> the size of the federal government.</p>

<p>85. Multimillion dollar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-bid_contract" rel="noopener noreferrer">no-bid</a> contracts are <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/08/the-yearly-bill-for-the-pentagons-no-bid-contracts-140-billion/" rel="noopener noreferrer">awarded</a>&nbsp;to companies by both <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/senate-democrat-seeks-investigation-of-obamas-no-bid-contract-for-smallpox-drug/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic</a> and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3340998/ns/business-oil_and_energy/t/halliburtons-iraq-contract-extended/#.UIYA76mPWSo" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a> administrations.</p>

<p>86. Instead of encouraging an open press, Republicans and Democrats <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2035994,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonize</a> the leak publishing organization known as WikiLeaks, and its founder Julian Assange, who are responsible for leaking information that has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/19/wikileaks-white-house-state-department" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> damaged U.S reputation. The U.S. military recently <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/us-calls-assange-enemy-of-state-20120927-26m7s.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">classified</a> WikiLeaks as an enemy of the state, the same legal category that Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are placed in.</p>

<p>87. Medicaid and Social Security were initially passed with strong support from <a href="http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2010/03/22/an-historic-vote-in-more-ways-than-one/" rel="noopener noreferrer">both parties</a>.</p>

[outset type="half"][/outset]88.&nbsp;Republicans and Democrats often claim that their administrations are transparent, <p><a href="http://endpartisanship.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="onetwothree.v2" height="280" src="cloudinary://governor-cuomo-wants-publicly-funded-campaigns-new-york-46364.gif" width="336"></a><a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/opinion/editorial/obama-congress-both-fail-on-goal-of-transparency/article_6179a99c-d856-51e6-9590-03db6193f5ea.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">but</a> <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/2500212#.UIwo72fcyYp" rel="noopener noreferrer">there</a> is <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/obama-transparency-fail-wont-admit-to-producing-mandatory-fisa-reports/article/2507615#.UIwonWfcyYo" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty</a> of <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/61878/shutting_down_transparent_government,_bush-style" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence</a> <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7904516028875682825" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicating</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/obama-blocks-drones-kill-list-release" rel="noopener noreferrer">otherwise</a>.</p>

<p>89.&nbsp;The Bush Administration <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/news/2001/09/fr091801.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">invoked</a> a state of national emergency following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and the Obama Administration <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/09/message-president-regarding-continuation-national-emergency-respect-cert" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended</a> the state of emergency, which allows for revocation of the right to habeas corpus.</p>

<p>90. Since the 1992 presidential debates -- which was the only year to include a Democratic, Republican and a third party candidate -- the Republican and Democratic candidates have refused to participate in presidential debates that include third parties. Obama and Romney campaigns both received invitations to the Free and Equal debates as well as the IVN online debate, but <a href="http://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005124" rel="noopener noreferrer">neither</a> candidate responded.</p>

<p>91.&nbsp;Both <a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/2012/10/27/gop-rigging-elections-for-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">parties</a> are <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/07/15/ny-democrat-voter-fraud-part-of-the-culture-for-both-major-political-parties/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124182750646102435.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">routinely</a> <a href="http://politic365.com/2012/10/21/republicans-tied-to-voter-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">involved</a> in <a href="http://politic365.com/2012/10/21/republicans-tied-to-voter-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter</a> <a href="http://politic365.com/2012/10/21/republicans-tied-to-voter-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fraud</a>.</p>

<p>92. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Intelligence Community</a>, which consists of at least sixteen various agencies, has grown <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of control</a> and has been left largely unchecked by either party, with some reports <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/09/06/140056904/the-top-secret-america-created-after-9-11" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicating</a> that no one knows how much money is spent.</p>

<p>93.&nbsp;Both the Democratic and Republican parties routinely&nbsp;<a href="http://article.wn.com/view/2012/08/28/Political_pandering_to_Americas_middle_class/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pander to the middle class</a> as they blame their opponents for hurting the middle class, and both platforms advocate for middle class tax cuts. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#International_comparisons" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple studies</a>&nbsp;have demonstrated that the United States has more income inequality than most other developed nations, with the poverty rate at <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-12/record-u-dot-s-dot-poverty-rate-holds-as-inequality-grows" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 percent</a> and the middle class suffering from almost a <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/eo20120829rs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">40 percent</a> wealth loss between 2007 and 2010. The top one percent, which most of our lawmakers belong to, has seen increased earnings up to <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42729" rel="noopener noreferrer">275 percent</a> in the past 35 years with the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105" rel="noopener noreferrer">top one percent</a> now controlling 40 percent of the nation's wealth.</p>

<p>94. The Republican and Democratic parties and candidate fail to adequately address the <a href="http://transitionvoice.com/2012/10/neither-presidential-candidate-shows-grasp-of-americas-oil-predicament/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue of peak oil</a>, which is when the maximum rate of petroleum extraction has been reached and the rate of production begins to decline.</p>

<p>95. Both parties refuse to accept responsibility for the credit downgrade and neither was successful at stopping the downgrade. When S&amp;P decided to downgrade the United States from an AAA credit rating to an AA+ rating, <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245316529563" rel="noopener noreferrer">they</a> <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/11213656/1/sp-blames-inept-congress-for-downgrade.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/08/05/s_p_downgrades_u_s_to_aa_blames_political_brinksmanship.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">that</a> the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20089038-503544/whos-to-blame-for-s-ps-u-s-credit-rating-downgrade-/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blame</a> lies with Congress and policymakers from both parties, dating back to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/3-us-policy-mistakes-most-responsible-sp-downgrade-841751" rel="noopener noreferrer">2001</a> and the Bush Administration.</p>

<p>96. Thanks to our Democratic and Republican lawmakers, the United States is one of only two countries in the world that permits pharmaceutical companies to advertise <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/03/big-pharmas-direct-to-consumer-advertising-corrupts-americas-health-culture/" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry#Direct_to_consumer_advertising" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumers</a>. The pharmaceutical <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2012&amp;ind=H04" rel="noopener noreferrer">lobby</a> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_lobby" rel="noopener noreferrer">routinely</a> the top lobbying industry, spending a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=H04&amp;year=2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">total</a> of $124,441,774 on lobbying in 2012 alone. Obama and Romney <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?cycle=2012&amp;ind=H04" rel="noopener noreferrer">each received</a>&nbsp;over one million dollars. In 2009, nearly <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/06/will-12-million-a-day-convince.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">three dozen</a> former congressmen worked as lobbyists for a&nbsp;pharmaceutical or health product company.</p>

<p>97. Republicans and Democrats <a href="http://influencealley.nationaljournal.com/2012/10/dem-and-gop-agree-government-n.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">agree</a> that the government needs more money.</p>

<p>98. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/157427/americans-split-need-third-party.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> Gallup poll suggests that many Americans -- 46 percent of those polled -- believe that a third party is needed because the Republican and Democratic parties are not doing an adequate job of representing the people.</p>

<p>99. There is bipartisan <a href="http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121022/NEWS90/210220309/-1/NEWS" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreement</a> that the Social Security payroll tax break should be allowed to expire, which would raise taxes on 163 million Americans regardless of who wins the election.</p>

<p>100. Presidential nominees for both parties are selected through a very complicated and expensive <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~dguber/POLS125/articles/piroth.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">process</a> which involves state caucuses and primaries that happen over the course of many months.</p>
