<p>What is Cavalia and why is it all the rave in San Diego? <a href="http://www.cavalia.net/en/cavalia-show/tickets-info/san-diego-ca-usa" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavalia</a> premiered locally on November 13 and is located in a massive white top downtown adjacent to Petco Park. On the surface, it may look like a “horse show,” but in actuality it offers much more than that. Cavalia provides a fresh mix of equestrian arts and special effects, as it has been known to be called "the equestrian ballet," and highlights the relationship between man and horse.</p>

<p>Cavalia is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec and has two shows that tour, Cavalia and Odysseo - both of which include equestrian arts. Cavalia first debuted in 2003 and has been attended by 3.5 million people across North America and Europe.</p>

<p>Offering a unique look at the history of horses in fairytale settings, and filled with emotion and poetry, the show combines dance, live music, arts, and acrobatics. This stellar combination shows off the splendor, nobility, and strength of these magnificent animals. San Diego is the only city in the United States where Cavalia will be premiere,&nbsp;and will be in town from Novmeber 13&nbsp;to December 2<span>,&nbsp;</span>and will have extended shows from December 22 to December 30&nbsp;due to the high number of ticket sales for the show.</p>

<p>“We enjoy Southern California so much we decided to call it our home for the holidays and are excited to spend one of the most joyful times of the year in San Diego,” said Normand Latourelle, Cavalia’s founder and artistic director. “Cavalia has a long time local following in San Diego since its initial visit in 2004. That is why we chose America’s Finest City for the last stop of our North American tour before traveling to the land Down Under for our first ever Australian tour in early 2013.”</p>
