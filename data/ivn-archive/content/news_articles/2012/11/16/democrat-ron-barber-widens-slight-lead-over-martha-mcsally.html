<p><img alt="" height="254" src="cloudinary://democrat-ron-barber-opens-slight-lead-over-martha-mcsally-49678.jpg" title="Ron Barber Martha McSally" width="599">Ron Barber has earned national name recognition since taking over for Gabby Giffords' congressional seat earlier this year. But the Democrat has not had an easy time keeping his seat in the heavily Republican state. As the polls closed on election day, McSally <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/07/ron-barber-martha-mcsally-too-close-to-call-in-az-cd-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">had a slight lead</a> over Barber in what is making for a surprise race in Arizona's 2nd Congressional district. But as the trend has been in many states across the country, the late voting has favored Democrats. Ten days past the election and Democrat Ron Barber has steadily gained votes, and now leads Republican Martha McSally by 923 votes.</p>
