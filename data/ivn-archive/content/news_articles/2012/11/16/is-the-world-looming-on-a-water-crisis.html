<p>The United States and Mexico are expected to sign a <a href="http://ivn.us/san-diego/2012/11/14/us-and-mexico-nearing-colorado-river-water-treaty-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer">water sharing agreement</a> regarding the Colorado River. The agreement took seven years to negotiate. But in many cases&nbsp;trans-boundary waterways lead to disputes, more precisely 1831 disputes between 1950 and 2000.</p>

<p>The Earth is covered at 70% by water, but only 2.5% is freshwater. Of this 2.5%, 70% is made of ice, 29% is underground leaving only 1% of freshwater readily available. This explains why the control over the major trans-boundary rivers often leads to disputes. Currently the major water related disputes are located in Asia between India and Pakistan, India and China and the countries&nbsp;neighboring the Aral Sea; in the Middle East for the control of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiger and&nbsp;Euphrates and Africa for the Nile.</p>
