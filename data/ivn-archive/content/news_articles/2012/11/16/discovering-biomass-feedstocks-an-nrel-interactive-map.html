<h5>Distribution Map for Biomass Feedstocks: Click the Image Above</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a> operates as the <a href="http://energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Department of Energy's</a> primary national laboratory for renewable energy efficiency research and development. Addressing the nation's energy and environmental goals, NREL has put out a series of <a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">robust mapping tools</a> that address certain distributions of energy sources and production.</p>
<p>Biofuel is a growing renewable energy industry which requires plant-based material(s), called feedstocks, to be the starting point in production. Biomass feedstocks are abundant and potential sources are found throughout the United States.</p>
<p>This mapping tool allows the user to turn on and off distribution layers of potentials for biomass feedstocks as well as other distributions of non-renewable resources, like coal and oil, and their production facilities.</p>
