<p>A recent guest who had to use the restroom on the second floor of downtown San Diego’s Hotel Palomar, came out of the facility shaking his head.</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t know San Diego was this hip,” he said, seemingly mildly amused.</p>

<p>Turns out the bathroom is a unisex potty.</p>

<p>It’s a trend more widely spotted in Los Angeles or Las Vegas. At the Hotel Palomar, which is part of the San Francisco-based chain of Kimpton boutique hotels, the sign outside the bathroom simply reads “His &amp; Hers.”</p>

<p>It’s a major architectural feat, first installed when the property was privately built as the one-off Se Hotel. The walls, ceiling and floor of the washroom are covered in rolled granite and inlaid with Lucite.</p>

<p>Gentlemen and ladies share a waterfall sink in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The bathroom is certainly a conversation piece – even if the conversation starts with, “Where are the stalls?” Turns out the stall doors are flush (if you will) with the granite walls, and not the easiest to discern.</p>

<p>And when you do find your way into some personal space, don’t look for a light switch. The lone source of interior illumination is a single bulb that shines up from the floor.</p>

<p>The facility serves both the hotel’s Saltbox restaurant and Summersalt Rooftop Bar &amp; Lounge.</p>

<p>Gals and guys who might ordinarily head to the restroom to speak in gender-specific tones would be well advised to save those conversations for another place.</p>
