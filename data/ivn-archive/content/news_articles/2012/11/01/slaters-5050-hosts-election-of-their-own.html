<p><span><span>As America anxiously awaits for the results of the 2012 elections on November 6, Slater’s 50/50 of San Diego will be holding an election of their own.&nbsp; Though this election will not involve choosing a president, or any other elected official for that matter, Slater's is asking fans choose between burgers created by Founder Scott Slater and Executive Chef Brad Lyons. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"Voters" have two burgers on the ballot - aptly named "The Brad" and "The Scott."
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>The Brad</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"The Brad” features Sterling Silver ground beef infused with Heinz 57 ketchup and caramelized red onion slices with two slices of cheddar cheese, thick cut bacon, beer battered jalapenos, sautéed mushrooms and garlic aioli on a white brioche bun. Lyons’ Le Cordon Blu training shows in the design of his burger which is refined and precise. </span></span></p>

<p><strong>The Scott</strong></p>

<p><span><span>"The Scott” also entails Sterling Silver ground beef as well, but is infused with A1 Sauce in place of ketchup.&nbsp; To add to the burger, Montreal Steak Seasoning is included in the patty process, plus blue cheese, bacon cheese, thick cut bacon, Kettle Chips, avocado mash, grilled onions and Thousand Island dressing on a <em>bacon</em> pretzel bun.&nbsp; Wait - a bacon bun? Finally.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The two burger candidates reflect the unique personalities – and tastes – of the Founder and Executive Chef. San Diegans will ultimately play a role in what burger shows their individual food personalities.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Slater's 50/50 is different than most burger joints in San Diego, as they utilize bacon in the patty making process.&nbsp; The tentative recipe involves fifty percent Sterling Silver ground beef, and fifty percent bacon, as well as other secret ingredients.&nbsp; Hence the name, Slater's 50/50.&nbsp; Located in the Liberty Station area off of Rosecrans Street, Slater's has joined many other San Diego businesses that have revitalized the former military area.
