How do you know who is really winning the Presidential election? This graph from the Huffington Post tracks 546 different Presidential Polls and puts them all in a single chart, and aggregates the results.</p>

Who is Really Winning the Presidential Election?</h4>


<p>Aside from aggregating views of voters about the presidential election, more and more polling firms have been asking voters about their political tendency, regardless of their "official" party registration.

<p>While most states condition a voter's ability to effectively participate in the election process through primary/caucus voting limitations and extraneous ballot access requirements for candidates who are not part of the Red or Blue teams, <a href="http://ivn.us/openprimaries/2012/10/28/arizonas-proposition-121-and-why-it-matters-to-everyone-else/" rel="noopener noreferrer">states like California</a> have adopted new voting laws that open up the process to everyone.</p>
