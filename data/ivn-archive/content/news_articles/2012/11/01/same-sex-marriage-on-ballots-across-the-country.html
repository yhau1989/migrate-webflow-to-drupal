<p>Four states have same-sex marriage on ballots this election, with voters in those states nearly split evenly on the issue. Citizens in&nbsp;Maryland, Washington, Maine, and Minnesota will choose whether or not to recognize same-sex marriage on Election Day. President Obama <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obama-comes-out-i-think-same-sex-couples-should-be-able-to-get-married/" rel="noopener noreferrer">has weighed in</a> on the issue and publicly stated his support of same-sex marriage. The national campaign director for Freedom to Marry, <a href="http://m.npr.org/news/U.S./163727661?page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Solomon</a>, noted the importance of the president's support and its potential impact on the outcome of the initiatives on Election Day.</p>

<h6>Maryland Question 6</h6>
<p>Question 6 is actually a referendum and aims to keep same-sex marriage legal. The Maryland General Assembly passed the initial same-sex marriage bill <a href="http://cnsmaryland.org/2012/02/17/house-narrowly-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in February</a> by a narrow margin, and now voters will have to decide whether to uphold the existing law. <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?tag=civil-marriage-protection-act" rel="noopener noreferrer">Governor O-Malley</a> and the legislature support the Civil Marriage Protection Act, which has redefined marriage to include same-sex couples.</p>

<p>The likelihood of the referendum being upheld is impacted in part by a high constituency of African American voters, who have traditionally opposed same-sex marriage (51 percent according to national <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Politics_and_Elections/Democrats%20Gay%20Marriage%20Support-tables.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center poll</a> in July). Nearly 30 percent of the v<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/10/26/163727661/gay-marriage-on-ballot-in-four-states-obama-endorses-measures" rel="noopener noreferrer">oting population</a> is African American, compared to 13 percent nationally.</p>

<p>The NAACP has supported the president’s endorsement of the right to same-sex marriage, which could increase the likelihood of the ballot measure passing. However, some African American voters have changed their opinion in recent weeks, according to a <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-10-27/news/bs-md-ballot-poll-20121027_1_maryland-marriage-alliance-african-american-voters-marriage-measures" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baltimore Sun poll</a>&nbsp;which currently shows the outlook as evenly split.</p>
<h6>Washington Referendum 74</h6>
<p>Like Maryland, same-sex marriage is legal in Washington State. The passage of Referendum 74 would uphold same-sex marriage. President Obama's press secretary, Paul Ball, stated, "Washington's same-sex marriage law would treat all Washington couples equally, and that is why the president supports a vote to approve <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-mirabella/president-obama-approve-r_b_2018781.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Referendum 74</a>." The bill was narrowly passed in Washington's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-gay-marriage-washington-idUSTRE81727F20120209" rel="noopener noreferrer">House</a>, 55 to 43, and&nbsp;<a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2017398387_gaymarriage02m.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate</a>, 28 to 21. According to the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACLU</a>, the latest polls <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/lgbt-rights/polling-numbers-giving-freedom-marry-ballot-efforts-advantage-election-day" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal an approval</a> rating of 49 percent.</p>

<h6>Minnesota Amendment One</h6>
<p>In Minnesota, the ballot initiative is actually an amendment to the state's constitution that would barr same-sex marriage and define marriage as only between a man and a woman. President Obama's&nbsp;Minnesota&nbsp;campaign <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/04/09/460852/obama-campaign-opposes-minnesota-marriage-discrimination-amendment/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> opposing the state’s proposed amendment to the Constitution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“That’s what the Minnesota ballot initiative would do – it would single out and discriminate against committed gay and lesbian couples – and that’s why the President does not support it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even with the Obama campaign's opposition to the state constitutional amendment,&nbsp;a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/176121921.html?refer=y" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent poll</a> found 48 percent of likely voters support the constitutional amendment, while 47 percent oppose it.</p>

<h6>Maine Question 1</h6>
<p>In Maine, the group <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/news/maine-Gay-marriage-referendum.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD) and other organizations mobilized voters to put an initiative in support of same-sex marriage on the November ballot. Supporters, encouraged by the campaign work of <a href="http://www.MainersUnited.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mainers United for Marriage</a>, delivered over <a href="http://www.mainersunited.org/pages/initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer">105,000 petition signatures</a> for the citizen’s initiative to the Secretary of the State, double the number of necessary signatures.</p>
<p>A poll by the Maine People’s Resource Center <a href="http://mprc.me/research/mprc_0412can12.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">found 58.2%</a> of registered voters supported same-sex marriage between March 31 and April 2, 2012, and a September 2012 Public Policy Polling survey shows similar results, with 52% of Maine voters supporting the <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_ME_92012.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">legalization of same-sex marriage</a>. Maine has emerged as the state, from among the battle ground states including Maine, Washington, and Minnesota, as the most likely to pass a bill authorizing the state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.</p>
