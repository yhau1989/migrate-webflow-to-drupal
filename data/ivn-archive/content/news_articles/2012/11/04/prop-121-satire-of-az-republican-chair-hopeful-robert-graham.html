<p>(Arizona) - For those of you unfamiliar with Arizona's Prop 121, the measure would <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/09/14/california-with-most-competitive-elections-in-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fundamentally change</a> the way the primary system is conducted in the state. Instead of party-controlled primaries, the system would be non-partisan; a single ballot for every candidate and voter.</p>



<p>Naturally, party leaders are not supporters of the measure. In California, for example, where the state went from the least competitive to the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/california-leads-nation-with-most-competitive-elections-massachusetts-finishes-last-169163516.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">most competitive elections</a> after the state held its first non-partisan primary, the two parties have continually challenged the measure in the court system in attempts to get their power over the process back.</p>



<p>Perhaps this video highlights the ultimate irony of the "No on Prop 121" talking points.</p>
