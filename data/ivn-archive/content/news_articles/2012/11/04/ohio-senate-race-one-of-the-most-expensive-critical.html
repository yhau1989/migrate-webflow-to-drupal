<p>While a majority of the pubic eye is stationed on Ohio's&nbsp;presidential&nbsp;poll numbers, the Ohio Senate race could&nbsp;have serious implications for the country as well.</p>

<p>The race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel is officially the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topraces.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">fifth most expensive</a> this election cycle. The candidates have raised more than $30 million total and the outcome of the race may very well determine which party holds the majority of the Senate come Election Day.</p>

<p>As of now, the 100-member Senate is Democratically controlled by 4 seats. Republicans need to weaken Brown, and a few other democratic incumbents, in order to regain control.</p>

<p>Brown is currently in the lead<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/10/ohio_us_senate_poll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 51 percent to 47 percent</a>, with a 3.1 percent margin of error, according to a Plain Dealer/Ohio Newspaper Poll released last week. The poll also reports independent voters prefer Brown by a 16-point margin.</p>

<p>Conservative super PACs and other third-party contributors have spent more than $19 million since last year in an effort to prevent incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown from being reelected to a second term.</p>

<p>Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies 9, which is co-founded by Karl Rove, Deputy Chief of Staff during the George W. Bush administration, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/10/ohios_us_senate_race_draws_mil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> spent a total of $8.9 million</a> in attack ads aimed at Brown in order to strengthen Mandel, and by extension, former Gov. Mitt Romney.</p>

<p>Brown has been hit harder by conservatives than anyone else in congress.</p>

<p>Brown is, however, receiving his fair share of<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-ohio-senatebre89s11t-20121029,0,6401526.story" rel="noopener noreferrer"> cash flow.</a> The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Majority PAC have spent a combined $6.5 million on ads promoting Brown and attacking Mandel.</p>

<p>Issues such as President Obama’s Affordable Care Act and the auto bailout are among the most targeted issues in the ads, considering Ohio's&nbsp;economy&nbsp;is extremely&nbsp;reliant&nbsp;on manufacturing jobs.</p>

<p>The $1 million campaign launched by the US Chamber of Commerce<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqcXum8uKYE" rel="noopener noreferrer"> accuses</a> Brown of throwing Ohioans under the bus by voting in favor of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.</p>
<blockquote>“While Ohioans opposed Obamacare, Brown voted for it, even though it will kill American jobs."</blockquote>
<p>According to a Washington Post Poll in September, 48 percent of registered Ohio voters said they hold unfavorable opinions of the president’s Affordable Care Act. However, 64 percent of Ohio registered voters said the auto-bailout&nbsp;was generally good for Ohio's economy.</p>

<p>American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal PAC, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNbTNoAyGe0" rel="noopener noreferrer">released an ad</a> claiming that Mandel has missed 85.4 percent of board meetings required of a State Treasurer while he was raising money and campaigning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/oct/04/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-ad-claims-josh-mandel-raised-campaig/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolitiFact</a> rated that claim as half-true, reporting there is no evidence that Mandel neglected his position while campaigning. Mandel sent representatives to sit in on many of the meetings he missed.</p>
<blockquote>“[Brown’s] campaign cited meetings of the Board of Deposit, on which Mandel sits, including at least one case where Mandel was fundraising in Washington on the day of a meeting. It also cited at least 44 out-of-state political events from March 2011 to July 2012 from Mandel’s schedule -- slightly less than three per month -- and more than 200 out-of-office events, of which at least 64 were fundraisers.”</blockquote>
<p>Mandel recently said he&nbsp;would not have backed the bailout, calling it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt2-gCd_vBc" rel="noopener noreferrer">“unamerican”</a> and claiming it cost too many nonunion employees their pensions.</p>

<p>In the most recent <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/02/14891866-polls-obama-stays-ahead-in-ohio-deadlocked-with-romney-in-fla?lite" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>&nbsp;/ Wall Street Journal poll, the president holds a 6-point lead over Gov. Romney in Ohio.</p>

<p>With only two days until Election Day, Republicans are on the defense and need to make the coming days count.</p>
