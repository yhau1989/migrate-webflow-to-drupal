<p>This election has featured some extremely tight races, even in states that traditionally lean one way or another. This unpredictability has led to rampant campaign <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/11/01/163632378/a-campaign-map-morphed-by-money" rel="noopener noreferrer">spending</a> by both the Republicans and the Democrats, and races in Arizona are no exception.</p>

<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ron_barber/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Barber</a>, former aid to Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D), who was injured in a shooting last year, is running for reelection in Arizona’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Congressional District. Barber, also injured in the attack, won the seat in a special election following Giffords’ June resignation.</p>

<p>With only a few days left until Election Day, the race is still too close to call. On Friday morning, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/02/house-republicans-could-add-to-their-majority-on-election-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a> reported that it is downgrading Barber into a “more vulnerable” status. A recent Real Clear Politics rating pins Arizona as “likely-Dem,” but <em><a href="http://tucsoncitizen.com/in-the-aggregate/2012/11/02/mcsally-can-defeat-barber-in-az-2-race-with-a-big-gop-turnout-on-election-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tuscon Citizen</a></em> is saying the 2<sup>nd</sup> Congressional District will almost certainly go to Barber’s challenger, Republican Martha McSally. The newspaper cites her ample support from independents in the district.</p>

<p>Barber and McSally debated&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;on October 23, and both candidates dealt harsh and personal stabs at one another. The main topic of discussion was health care.&nbsp; Both advocated the need for change within the Affordable Care Act - although McSally wants to restore the $716 billion “<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2012/10/15/20121015barber-mcsally-hold-final-debate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">robbed</a>” from Medicare.</p>

<p>According to an Arizona newspaper’s November 2<sup>nd</sup> <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2012/10/04/20121004barber-mcsally-make-race-district-unpredictable.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> of the race’s standing, both Democrats and Republicans are extremely confident.</p>

<p>A Democratic political strategist noted, “By any objective standards [McSally is] a strong candidate. ... But even before Ron [Barber] worked for Gabby [Giffords], he was well-known throughout southern Arizona. He's built a reputation as honest and fair- dealing."</p>

<p>A representative of the National Republican Congressional Committee retorted, “[It] is now a very close battle. I really attribute that to Martha McSally.”</p>

<p>Starting Tuesday, Giffords’ husband, astronaut <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2012/10/30/giffords-kelly-boost-democrats-in.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Kelly</a>, began an e-mailing campaign supporting the Democratic ticket for Congress, which also includes Richard Carmona for US Senate.</p>

<p>The Senate race is also much closer than originally expected, as Carmona reaches out to Hispanic and independents in a final push to<a href="http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/state/flake-vs-carmona-senate-race-in-arizona-closer-than-initially-thought" rel="noopener noreferrer"> secure Arizona</a> for the Democrats. Carmona has distanced himself from Barak Obama in hopes of gaining support from last minute undecided voters who may be more sympathetic to the Republican cause.</p>

<p>Both Mitt Romney and John McCain have made appeals to voters to cast their ballots for Carmona's Republican challenger, Jeff Flake.</p>
