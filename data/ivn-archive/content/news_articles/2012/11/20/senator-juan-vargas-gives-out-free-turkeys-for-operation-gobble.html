<p>California State Senator Juan Vargas of the 40th District led the 22nd annual <a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Operation-gobble-Vargas.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Gobble in San Diego</a>. The light-hearted titled event is a&nbsp;state-wide&nbsp;turkey drive that donates to families for Thanksgiving. This year's drive in San Diego took place on Nov. 20 from 11am to 1pm.</p>
<p>Senator Juan Vargas held the drive at the Nestor Head Start Center off Grove Avenue in the Chula Vista area. Over one-hundred turkeys are given to families who were pre-selected in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>This isn't Senator Juan Vargas' first turkey&nbsp;give-away&nbsp;this year. The press release announcing San Diego's participation in Operation Gobble stated:</p>
<blockquote>Last week, Senator Vargas’ office partnered with Golden State Water, the Niland Chamber of Commerce and the Calipatria Chamber of Commerce to deliver fifty turkeys to needy families in Niland and Calipatria.&nbsp; The families were selected by the Calipatria Unified School District based on the families’ individual need.</blockquote>
<p>The office of Senator Juan Vargas partnered with the non-profit Episcopal Community Services (ECS). ECS operates Head Start programs in southern San Diego. The <a href="http://www.amwater.com/caaw/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California American Water</a>&nbsp;(CAAW), who operates Operation Gobble, donates the turkeys for the state-wide drive. Sen. Vargas himself <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=abc4oSyqi58E" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented on the being a part of the service</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote>“Sharing food with family and friends at Thanksgiving is something we all cherish and ‘Operation Gobble’ keeps that tradition going for many families in our region. I'm grateful for California American Water’s generosity and the comfort they helped bring to families struggling this holiday season.”</blockquote>
<p>State legislators from all of California participate in CAAW's turkey donation. Operation Gobble gives away over 30,000 leading up to Thanksgiving every year. Senator of the 26th district <a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMERPR/2179711100x0x614370/502f4e67-6380-405f-9e11-e444717cb7ec/Senator_Price_Operation_Gobble_0111612.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curren Price says</a>, "This program raises awareness of the issue of hunger in California while helping those who&nbsp;need it most. This year more than ever, it is important that we all&nbsp;help to ensure that every Californian can be thankful during this Thanksgiving season."</p>
