<p><img alt="" height="338" src="cloudinary://People-in-Politics.jpg" title="People in Politics" width="600">We hear a lot of discussion of the fiscal cliff, taxes, energy policy, and other broad issues that are important to our prosperity. But, we hear less about the people who are crafting the legislation and have to make the critical votes in shaping our future.</p>

<p>It is easy to be a journalist or a philosopher, like a Monday morning quarter-back in the land of "what ifs." This week on IVN, we pay special attention to the people in politics who have to make practical decisions in the reality of "what now."</p>
