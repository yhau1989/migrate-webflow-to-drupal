<p>A 2009 book by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett made an interesting link between income inequality and the happiness and health of a society.&nbsp;The thesis&nbsp;argues&nbsp;that there is a&nbsp;correlation between&nbsp;the width of the income gap and societal factors such as life expectancy, obesity rate, murder rates, and prison population.</p>

<p>The following infographic, published by the<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New Statesman</a>, which compares the latest data of 6 countries, Sweden, Japan, Germany, France, the UK and the US, confirms, in a striking way, what the price of inequality is.</p>
