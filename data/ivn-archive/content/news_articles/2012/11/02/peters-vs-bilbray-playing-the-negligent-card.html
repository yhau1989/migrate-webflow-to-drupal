<p>The race to win the redrawn 52<sup>nd</sup> Congressional District in California is on the national radar, with incumbent Congressman <a href="http://bilbray.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Bilbray</a> facing off against former San Diego City Council member <a href="http://www.scottpeters.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Peters</a>.</p>
<p>Both national parties have spent millions of dollars filling San Diego airwaves with negative attack ads against both candidates.</p>

<p>If everything we hear on TV is true, then Bilbray has taken campaign contributions from special interest groups he lobbied for. And, he protects the tax subsidies of Big Oil. As a congressman, Bilbray voted with former President Bush 93 percent of the time. There’s not much of a public or political bloc left that would consider that a positive for a candidate running in 2012.</p>

<p>From the other side of the fence, the GOP says Peters wants to cut Medicaid benefits. And they’ve labeled him a “negligent” former San Diego city councilman who nearly led the city into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It’s the campaign strategy of Twist and Shout. If ever a race screamed out for a third-party candidate, it’s this one.</p>

<p>Bilbray would seem to represent thirty-six years of broken politics. But hang on. Zeroing in on one chapter of Peters’ career does seem to reveal a series of events that, at the time, appeared to be a political Achilles heel.</p>
<p>In 2002, Peters voted with the majority of the San Diego city council to underfund the city’s pension system. This was after a Blue Ribbon Committee on City Finances warned of the risk. Instead, the council voted to do away with the fund’s safety net.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, national newspapers were calling San Diego “Enron-by-the-Sea.” Today, the after effects linger, and the city is still roughly $2 billion in pension arrears.</p>

<p>Then-mayor Dick Murphy, council members Peters, Toni Atkins, Jim Madaffer and Brian Maienschein&nbsp;were part of a fraud investigation&nbsp;by the Security Exchange Commission. All were eventually labeled “negligent” in the probe.</p>

<p>The collective cost of defending the politicians against the SEC charges was $2.7 million, including $600,000 for Peters.</p>

<p>Walking away from an SEC probe with a label of negligent did not seem to be a feather in the cap that any politician would want to ride forward under. Indeed, Peters ran and lost in 2008 to Mike Aguirre in a quest to be San Diego’s city attorney.</p>

<p>Peters was then appointed to the <a href="http://www.portofsandiego.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Port Commission</a>. Recent news reports suggest he proposed negative amortization/under-funding plans to the Port, but the idea was rebuffed.</p>

<p>Former council member Atkins has managed to salvage a political career. She’s represents San Diego’s 76<sup>th</sup> District in the California State Assembly. But if you take a short trip in the Way-Back Machine to the mid-2000s, it’s hard to imagine any of the local public servants who were handed out “negligent” buttons would ever take another step up the political ladder.</p>
