<p>Food Trucks are blowing up in San Diego. &nbsp;What is the appeal with a food truck and why are they becoming all the rave?&nbsp; Food Trucks enable people to open up a "mini" restaurant that is a much lower cost than opening up an actual restaurant and have been around since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_truck" rel="noopener noreferrer">American civil war</a>.</p>

<p>San Diego offers <a href="http://sdfoodtrucks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">68 different choices</a>, so how does one decide on where to eat?&nbsp; From Asian cuisine to Burgers, food trucks provide San Diegans with a variety of options. Here are some of our favorite picks in San Diego!</p>

<p>John Adams, the owner of Epic Eatz opened up shop in January 2012 to serve the San Diego community "Surf Cuisine," and is serving up delicious dishes including fish tacos, local Halibut ceviche, Hawaiian ahi poki and carnitas.

<p>Amanda Caniglia decided that San Diego needed&nbsp;Swiss style hot dogs. Amanda and her husband Nico started their food truck December 2010 when they made their debut at December Nights in Balboa park. A Swiener&nbsp;&nbsp;is a baquette with melted &nbsp;cheese&nbsp;on the inside with the sausage. With 7 choices of sausages to choose from and fresh bread, how can one go wrong. Most popular item is a tie between the Spice Pork with dijon and melted swiss cheese or the Chicken Apple with caramelized onion sauce and melted raclette cheese and paprika.</p>
