<p><img alt="" height="300" src="cloudinary://san-diego-beer-week-begins-november-2nd-drinkers-need-apply-52564-194x300.jpg" title="sdbw blank" width="194">It is no surprise that San Diegans love their beer.&nbsp; Whether one prefers IPAs, Pale Ales, Lambics, Stouts, or simply something with a higher ABV (alcohol by volume), San Diego beer week is the perfect forum to celebrate all things barley and hops.&nbsp; For this reason, and for beer's sake in general, the <a href="http://www.sandiegobrewersguild.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Brewers Guild</a> will be hosting San Diego Beer Week through November 2-11.</p>

<p>The city is home to some of the more well-known breweries in the country, so it is only natural for the event to last a week- well, more than a week- as trying to squeeze in 400 plus events will call for a lot of drinking.</p>

<p>The fourth annual event(s) of it's kind, San Diego Beer Week, or SDBW 2012, will host beer dinners, festivals, rare bottle tastings, cheese pairings, brewery tours, classes, and much more.&nbsp; SDBW is funded in part by the <a href="http://www.sdtmd.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Tourism Marketing District</a>, through the utilization of <a href="http://www.sdtmd.org/sdtmd-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of San Diego Tourism Marketing District Assessment Funds</a>.</p>

<p>Festivities begin with the "Tap Takeover" on November 2 at 7am sharp (yes, it is socially acceptable to drink this early) at La Bella Pizza/Cafe and Game in South County.&nbsp; The Tap Takeover will continue throughout the day into November 3, with local breweries Karl Strauss, Stone, and Ballast Point running shop intermittently.&nbsp; If that is too early for one to start slamming pints, Stone and Karl Strauss will be hosting "beer breakfasts" at their respective breweries from 9am-12pm.</p>

<p>A city-wide celebration, the festivities will cover nearly every part of San Diego County.&nbsp; For more information on the full day of events on Friday November 2, click <a href="http://sdbw.org/events/#2012-11-02" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp; With the election season nearly coming to a close, it is highly encouraged to stop the partisan bickering, and simply join the party.</p>
