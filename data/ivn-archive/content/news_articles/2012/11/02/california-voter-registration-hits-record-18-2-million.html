<p>In a <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/admin/press-releases/2012/db12-106.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>&nbsp;released today, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen reports that California voter registration hit a record 18.2 million voters. The percentage of eligible Californians registered to vote, however, has remained relatively stable for the last decade, reaching 76.7% this year.</p>

<p>While California remains a heavily Democratic state, with 43.66% of registered Democrats, independent voters are an active and vocal force in California politics. Of the voters registered for Tuesday's election, 21% have no party preference. Moreover, the number of Californians registered Republican dropped to 29.36 percent.</p>

<p>The growing trend is reflected by the Democratic House, Senate, and Governor. The possibility of Democrats gaining a supermajority in the State Senate, a&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/ca-election-center/2012/10/29/for-some-californians-the-number-27-is-scarier-than-halloween/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>de facto</em> single-party rule</a>, is made even more clear in the final days before the election.</p>

<p>This year marks the first year California had the option to register to vote online. The Los Angeles Times <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/11/california-record-182-million-registered-to-vote.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>&nbsp;on analysis by Political Data Inc., a bipartisan company, finding that at least 780,688 people used the online system for California voter registration. Young California voters, in particular, utilized the online system, with 61.5% of those registering online&nbsp;under age 35.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Debra Bowen notes that while registering to vote was easier than before, fewer people registered in the 45-day window before the deadline than did in 2008.</p>

<p><em>"This makes it clear that it’s not just a question of making voter registration easier; it’s really about what inspires people to care about their democracy and be part of the decision-making process," said Bowen.</em></p>
