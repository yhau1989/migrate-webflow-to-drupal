<p><img alt="Hera Hub" height="273" src="cloudinary://workspace-for-women-hera-hub-41028.jpg" title="Hera Hub" width="600">San Diego is becoming a hub for co-working spaces. Hera Hub, which was started by Felena Hanson back in August 2011 in Sorrento Valley, is a shared workspace that is spa inspired for female entrepreneurs in San Diego. It provides a space that is just for women and is a professional space that enables members to meet with clients and provide them with support they need to be successful. Hera Hub prides itself in being more than just a co-working space for women but a place where like minded business owner's can come together and support each other on the growth of each others business.</p>

<p>Hera Hub decided that since so many women were coming from all over the county to Sorrento Valley for work, they decided it was time to open up another location in Mission Valley. They offer members a monthly membership option that is great for independent consultants, entrepreneurs, and many other professions in San Diego.</p>

<p>Other benefits include free coffee, WiFi, conference calling, parking, unlimited black and white printings and monthly cocktail hours.&nbsp;Hera hub is looking to open an additional location in Carlsbad and looking to move into other markets across the United States by 2016.</p>

<p>With all of the amenities in the conducive workspace, Hera Hub is helping women all over San Diego flourish in their business.</p>
