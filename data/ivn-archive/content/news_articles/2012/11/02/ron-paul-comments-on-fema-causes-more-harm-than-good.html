<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy this week, the New York Times declared, "A big storm requires big government."</p>

<p>On John Stossel's Fox Business program this week, however, Congressman and former presidential candidate, Ron Paul argued that FEMA actually causes more harm than good:</p>
<blockquote>"It causes more harm than good. We've handled floods and disasters for 204 years before we had FEMA, and the states and the volunteers and local communities did quite well.&nbsp; You know, I've taken this position for a long time. It's not just recently. And I've taken it since I was first in office, and I kept getting reelected, because people in my district got tired of FEMA. All they had were headaches. They get locked into their insurance and then it's a bureaucracy and I'd try to help them get through the bureaucracy, but they'd just come in and take over."</blockquote>
