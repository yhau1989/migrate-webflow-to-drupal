<p>Tuesday's election night with Barack Obama's re-election was the most tweeted political event in history with more than 300,000 tweets per minute. This is the conclusion of an election where social media played a major role for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney as well as for the third party candidates.</p>

<p>Obama who easily won&nbsp;enough electoral votes to be re-elected had dominated John McCain on social media in 2008 and remained the number front runner on social media this year as well. The following infographic, created by <a href="http://www.verticalmeasures.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertical Measures</a>, recaps how well each candidate did in terms of social media.</p>

<p>Do you think that Obama's supremacy online had a real influence on his re-election?</p>
