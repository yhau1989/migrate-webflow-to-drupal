<ul>
	<li><strong>MONEY</strong>.&nbsp; Even though the Supreme Court’s&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em>&nbsp;decision allowed gross amounts of&nbsp;<a href="http://visual.ly/cost-2012-us-elections" rel="noopener noreferrer">money</a>&nbsp;(almost&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/08/2012-election-will-be-costliest-yet.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$6&nbsp;<em>billion</em></a>) from known and unknown donors to distort the process, few elections near the top of the ballot appear to have been bought.&nbsp; But the down-ballot races may be most of the iceberg.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big money may not have overwhelmed the electoral system in 2012, but that’s far from saying big money doesn’t control too much of government and too many public officials.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>PROCESS</strong>.&nbsp; Even though hyper-partisan Republican legislators, election officials, and outside groups made a concerted effort by a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=9706" rel="noopener noreferrer">variety</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/06/chaos-reins-at-florida-polls-on-election-day.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">means</a>&nbsp;to suppress voting by likely Democratic-leaning constituencies, there was sufficient pushback from the courts, the Justice Department, and professional election officials to allow the democratic process to function pretty well.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like a fair and open election seems to have taken place in 2012, but the people who attacked the process mostly remain in power.&nbsp; Their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/11/07/how_ridiculous_gerrymanders_saved_the_house_republican_majority.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">gerrymandered</a>&nbsp;Congressional districts will remain in place till the next census, in 2020. Unless these people begin to re-think their beliefs, they will continue to have strong motivation to skew the electorate in any way they can, and they will likely try.</p>

<p><strong>Perceiving Reality Remains a National Challenge&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The results of Election 2012 may also support a second hopeful proposition that:&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/07/why_revenge_is_sweet/?source=newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer">denying</a>&nbsp;reality is not as good a path to political victory as it used to be</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/11/07/1155181/huge-wins-on-popular-referendums-chart-progressive-national-course/" rel="noopener noreferrer">portents</a>, some&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/progress-report/rack-em-up/" rel="noopener noreferrer">straws</a>&nbsp;in the wind:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>OBSTRUCTIONISM</strong>. Republicans in Congress (and out) preferred to perpetuate economic suffering rather than risking the perception that the President had any success.&nbsp;<a href="http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/14410-focus-a-thrashing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enough</a>&nbsp;of a less than grateful nation saw through the tactic to prevent it from succeeding.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>CLIMATE</strong>.&nbsp; Nobody talked about the climate, and nobody did anything about it, either.&nbsp; Then Hurricane&nbsp;<a href="http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/14412-focus-hurricane-sandy-beware-of-americas-disaster-capitalists" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandy</a>&nbsp;helped the President win re-election.&nbsp; The big money still backs denial and continued planetary destruction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>WOMEN</strong>. &nbsp;Maybe it’s not God’s will when rape produces pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/11/07/1143331/six-congressional-races-where-gop-extremism-lost/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Candidates</a>&nbsp;who believed it was ended up losing races they could have won. &nbsp;That was the will of the electorate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>MARRIAGE</strong>.&nbsp; The idea that two people who want to get married should have that right in modern America was endorsed by electorates for the first time.&nbsp; False gender stereotypes and appeals to a false notion of “traditional marriage” lost some of their power to cloud people’s minds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>MARIJUANA</strong>.&nbsp; “Reefer Madness” propaganda failed to persuade voters in two states.&nbsp; The dishonesty and stupidity of the “war on drugs” is becoming obvious to a majority of Americans.&nbsp; Does that majority include the President yet?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>RACE</strong>.&nbsp; Years of overt and covert racism failed to prevent the President’s re-election.&nbsp; Is the country post-racial yet?&nbsp; Hardly.&nbsp; But people who agree with what Bill&nbsp;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/07/whites_only_gop_meets_its_demographic_destiny/?source=newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer">O’Reilly</a>&nbsp;means when he says, “it’s not a traditional America anymore,” are part of a slowly contracting minority</li>
</ul>
<p>Some scales have fallen from some eyes, but the country still suffers from many chronic delusions.&nbsp; Probably the most dangerous is the near hysterical fear of Iran having a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; We also remain deluded about the efficacy of nuclear weapons generally, as well as the rationality of nuclear power.&nbsp; And we still imagine that we’re so exceptional that we can – and should – work our will anywhere we want in the world.&nbsp; Even if we could, it wouldn’t be a good idea.</p>

<p>The totality of the election was not a&nbsp;<a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2012/11/07/a-great-night-for-us-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">victory</a>&nbsp;so much as an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Lesser-Evil-Won-Now-G-by-Rob-Kall-121107-239.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">escape</a>&nbsp;from defeat.&nbsp; But there were enough smaller, real victories across the country to make the larger&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/11/07/1155641/obama-second-term-to-do-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer">victory</a>&nbsp;seem almost possible again. Elections Have Consequences.</p>
