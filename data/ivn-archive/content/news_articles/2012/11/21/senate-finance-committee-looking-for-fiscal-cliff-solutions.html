<p>As negotiations on how to resolve the ‘fiscal cliff’ broil on, the Senate Finance Committee acts as a crucible to determine policy outcomes. The Finance Committee naturally maintains heavy influence over policy relating to taxes and entitlement programs and Chairman, Max Baucus (D-Montana), has revealed somewhat positive indications regarding fiscal cliff talks.</p>

<p>Baucus <a href="http://www.kaj18.com/news/baucus-hopes-congress-can-avoid-fiscal-cliff-/#!prettyPhoto/0/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> local news affiliate KPAX:</p>
<blockquote>“I expect good faith, because the election is over and more than that, members of Congress know what the problem is. They know we’ve got a huge big debt. It’s got to be chipped away at. They know we can’t go off this fiscal cliff and I think we’ll find a solution.”</blockquote>
<p>The Hill has <a href="thehill.com/homenews/senate/268805-baucus-demands-seat-at-table-for-tax-budget-talks" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicated</a> that parts of Finance Committee member Ron Wyden’s (D-Oregon) “Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2011” are likely models for parts of a budget deal. The bill, cosponsored by Dan Coats (R-Indiana), would “[Create] a new 35 percent exclusion and a progressive rate structure for dividend and long-term capital gains income.”</p>

<p>This near 20 percent increase provides a significant revenue option for lawmakers. The Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12085/03-10-reducingthedeficit.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> that similar policies of increasing the capital gains rate could “raise revenues by a total of $10 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $49 billion from 2012 through 2021.”</p>

<p>Regarding other aspects of a budget deal, Baucus has been <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83831_Page2.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pushing</a> for rate hikes on the top 2% of Americans, but not necessarily for them to return to their pre-Bush levels of 36% and 39.6% for high earners.</p>

<p>Yet, Ranking Finance Committee Member Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) spoke out against raising tax rates on Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/your-world-cavuto/2012/11/20/tax-hikes-center-fiscal-cliff-talks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monday</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“Well, we hope so, because none of us are for rate increases. We are for finding enough revenue to satisfy the president in the code itself. I think that's something we can do. But to raise the rates would hit a million small businesses and lose about 700,000 jobs.”</blockquote>
<p>The details of a final budget overhaul are still unknowable, and congressional Republicans and Democrats largely remain split on raising tax rates for those earning over $250,000 a year. Baucus and the Democrats have shown some flexibility with regards to how high, but many Republicans remain unmoved.</p>
