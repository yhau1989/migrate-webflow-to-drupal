<p>Preparing Thanksgiving dinner can be quite the task - becoming an all day event not including the clean up afterwards. Why not let Marina Kitchen take the hassle out of cooking all day for your family, and join them for their Thanksgiving Day meal? Executive Chef Aaron Schwartz is preparing a feast with many Thanksgiving favorites on the menu.</p>

<p>Marina Kitchen located at 333 West Harbor Drive inside the San Diego Marriott and Marquis&nbsp;will be serving a three course meal that can include wine pairings if you choose. The first course kicks starts off with some delicious appetizers, including your choice of roasted butternut squash soup, local field green salad, buratta cheese, or&nbsp;charcuterie&nbsp;plate. Second course provides the option of herb roasted free range turkey, daily seasonal fish, roasted brandt beef new york, or cinderella pumpkin risotto. To finish the evening is a tasty selection of three delicious desserts including a Makers Mark milkshake, pumpkin pie or apple tart.</p>
