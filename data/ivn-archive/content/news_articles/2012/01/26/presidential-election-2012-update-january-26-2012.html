<p>The four remaining Republican presidential candidates will meet in Jacksonville, Florida for the 19th Republican debate, tonight at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. central, 5 p.m. pacific). Hosted by CNN, this debate is a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/01/26/political-wisdom-whats-at-stake-in-tonights-florida-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">make or break moment</a> for the political rivalry between Romney and Gingrich. Unlike Monday's debate, this debate will allow audience applause.</p>

<p>What's at stake? All of Florida's 50 delegates will go to the winner of Tuesday's primary.</p>

Speaking at a Tea Party rally in Mount Dora in Central Florida, he said "There is something so grotesquely hypocritical about the Romney campaign." Romney's tax returns continue to play a central role in Gingrich's verbal attacks.</p>

In response to Obama, the Occupy Wall Street movement reported on the group's website a <a href="http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/state-of-the-union-ows-tea/1/25/2012/id/39040" rel="noopener noreferrer">concern with</a> "Obama's lofty goals and his&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to actually deliver them."&nbsp; Mitt Romney's response focused on the President's economic policy, as he criticized Obama for being <a href="http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/state-of-the-union-ows-tea/1/25/2012/id/39040" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of touch</a> with the reality of the nation's&nbsp;deficit.</p>

In other news, the Congressman continues his campaign to end the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). <a href="http://rt.com/usa/news/ron-paul-end-tsa-595/" rel="noopener noreferrer">He states</a> on his official website:</p>
<blockquote>“The police state in this country is growing out of control. One of the ultimate embodiments of this is the TSA that gropes and grabs our children, our seniors and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities.”</blockquote>

According to the New York Times, Romney's campaign is getting personal, attacking Gingrich’s morals and emotional stability.
