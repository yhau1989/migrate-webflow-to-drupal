<p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong> beat Santorum by a slim margin of 0.1%, which <a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/04/need-to-know-news-mitt-romney-defeats-rick-santorum-by-8-votes-in-iowa-syrian-rebels-eye-huge-operations/?hpt=pm_mid" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> reports was just 8 votes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rick Santorum</strong>, feeling confident about his campaign, tells&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iowa-caucus-results-mitt-romney-defeats-rick-santorum-8-votes/story?id=15283406#.TwSVQSNWpdo" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, “<em>A win here is a start. It’s not the culmination, it’s the beginning.</em>”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Paul</strong> came in third place with 21.4%, gaining a large proportion of the independent and youth votes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Newt Gingrich</strong>, finishing fourth with 13.3% of the vote, took a clear shot at Romney congratulating Santorum on a positive campaign, but adding, “<em>I wish I could say that for all the candidates,</em>” <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iowa-caucus-results-mitt-romney-defeats-rick-santorum-8-votes/story?id=15283406#.TwSVQSNWpdo" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Perry</strong> with a&nbsp;disappointing fifth place finish expelled rumors of him stepping out of the race by tweeting “<em>And the next leg of the marathon is the Palmetto State…Here we come South Carolina!!!</em>“&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/From-the-Wires/2012/0104/Rick-Perry-tweets-that-he-s-still-in-the-GOP-hunt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Science Monitor</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in sixth place came <strong>Michele Bachmann</strong>, who decided to suspend her campaign for presidency and backed out by saying: “<em>Last night, the people of Iowa spoke with a very clear voice, and so I have decided to stand aside</em>,” <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57352112-503544/michele-bachmann-drops-out-of-gop-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Political Hotsheet</a> reports.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean? Well,<strong> Jon Huntsman</strong>, who skipped Iowa to focus his attention on New Hampshire, says the results are “<em>unbelievably&nbsp;ambiguous</em>,” and that “<em>no one in New Hampshire cares about what happened there</em>” (<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71071.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think the Iowa results indicate about the election to come?&nbsp;</p>
