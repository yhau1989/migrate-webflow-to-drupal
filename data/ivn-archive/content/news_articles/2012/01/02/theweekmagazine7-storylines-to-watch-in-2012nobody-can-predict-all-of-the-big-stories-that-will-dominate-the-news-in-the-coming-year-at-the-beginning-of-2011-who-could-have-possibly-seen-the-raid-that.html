<p><strong>7 storylines to watch in 2012</strong></p>
<p>Nobody can predict all of the big stories that will dominate the news in  the coming year. At the beginning of 2011, who could have possibly seen  the raid that killed Osama bin Laden coming? Or Japan’s tsunami? Or the  Arab Spring? Or Justin Bieber’s haircut?  Still, there are some looming questions that are bound to be answered  this year. From the economy to the presidential race to the fate of  Apple without the late Steve Jobs, <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/222398/7-storylines-to-watch-in-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">here are some key questions to be  answered in 2012</a>:</p>
<p><strong>1. Which GOP candidate will win the nomination?<br></strong>In 2011, a parade of Republican presidential prospects soared in  popularity, only to come quickly crashing down to Earth. GOP voters  flirted with Donald Trump, then moved on to Michele Bachmann, Rick  Perry, and Herman Cain. As the year ended, the race was looking like it  was “finally turning into a real fight” between Mitt Romney and Newt  Gingrich, says Jay Newton-Small at <em>TIME</em>. But now, Rick Santorum is surging in Iowa, and Newt is crashing. Still, anything could happen,&nbsp;says Rhodes Cook at <em>Sabato’s Crystal Ball</em>.  It used to be much easier to pull off a “quick knockout” on Super  Tuesday, but now there are so many big, late primaries that a dark horse could still enter the race … and win.</p>
<p><strong>2. And will the Republican beat Obama?</strong><br>With the president’s approval ratings in the dumps,&nbsp;says Mona Charen at the Elizabethton <em>Star</em>,  “some Republicans seem to have concluded that the party could nominate a  ham sandwich and still defeat Obama.” Even some liberals concede that  if the election were held today, the president could very well lose. But  “a year is a long time in politics.” Obama is “amassing a huge war  chest,” and he’s effectively accusing his rivals of doing the bidding of  the rich at the expense of the poor. “To escape the noose the president  is preparing, the Republican nominee must… convince independents and  moderates that Republican reforms would benefit everyone, not just those  at the top.”</p>
<p><strong>3. Will “ObamaCare” survive?</strong><br>As part of its “potentially epic” term, the&nbsp;Supreme Court&nbsp;is  expected to weigh in by June 2012 on the constitutionality of President  Obama’s health care reform law. Even legal experts aren’t sure which  way the starkly-divided Roberts Court will rule. But if the court knocks  down all or part of President Obama’s signature legislative  achievement, it could deal his campaign a&nbsp;deadly blow. If Obama prevails, he’ll be able to claim vindication — and take away one of the GOP’s main arguments against him.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which dictator will be the next to fall?</strong><br>The Arab  Spring swept aside a parade of brutal longtime rulers. Egypt’s Hosni  Mubarak is on trial for corruption and deadly repression. Libya’s  Moammar Gadhafi is dead. Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali is out of a  job. And the spirit of protest is still strong in the Arab world. So  who’s next? The oil-rich royal family in Saudi Arabia is facing  protests. Yemeni leader Ali Abdullah Saleh has signed an agreement  promising to leave, but many fear that with his family still controlling  the military, “he’s not going away.” The smart money is that embattled  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will be the next addition  to the fallen dictators’ club. And don’t forget Russia’s Vladimir  Putin. The longtime Russian strongman is seeking a third presidential  term in March, but is already facing massive protests from fed-up citizens.</p>
