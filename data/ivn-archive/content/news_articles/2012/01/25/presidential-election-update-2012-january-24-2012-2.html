<p>Last night’s debate in Tampa, Florida marked the 18th Republican Presidential debate of the 2012 election. What made it different than the previous ones, however, was the lack of audience participation. NBC host Brian Williams told members of the audience to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/republican-presidential-debate-audience-silence_n_1225953.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold their applause</a>&nbsp;in an attempt to focus attention on the candidates’ arguments, not their popularity with the audience.</p>
<p>After refusing to release his tax returns until he secured the GOP presidential nomination, Mitt Romney made headlines early this morning by releasing details of his 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns. Romney’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-24/romney-paid-13-9-percent-tax-rate-on-21-6-million-2010-income.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign revealed</a>&nbsp;that he earned $21.6 million in 2010 and paid income taxes at a rate of 13.9%.</p>
<p>Tonight, President Barack Obama delivers his fourth State of the Union Address. Members of Congress have opted once again to participate in a bipartisan seating arrangement in a&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/state-of-the-union-date-night-on-capitol-hill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">symbolic gesture</a>&nbsp;of unity and civility. The 9 p.m. speech (8 p.m. central, 6 p.m. pacific) can be viewed on most of the major television networks and online at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House Official Website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Newt Gingrich (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>This morning, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich threatened not to participate in any future Republican debates if audience participation continued to be prohibited. In his opinion, “<a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/gingrich-says-he-will-skip-debates-if-audiences-cant-participate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC’s rules amounted to stifling free speech</a>…The media doesn’t control free speech. People ought to be allowed to applaud if they want to.” Despite the lack of audience participation, Gingrich and Romney remained at center stage,&nbsp;<a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2012/01/24/the-morning-after-come-back-loud-debate-audiences-all-is-forgiven/" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to</a>&nbsp;TIME correspondent James Poniewozik.</p>

<p><strong>Barack Obama (Democrat):&nbsp;</strong>Today President Obama will deliver his annual State of the Union Address at 9 p.m. ET. He is expected to&nbsp;<a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/barack-obama-to-make-tax-point-with-warren-buffett-secretary-debbie-bosanek/articleshow/11619597.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlight inequalities</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. tax system, inviting Warren Buffet’s secretary to attend, who reportedly pays a higher tax rate than her billionaire boss. In a September speech,&nbsp;<a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/barack-obama-to-make-tax-point-with-warren-buffett-secretary-debbie-bosanek/articleshow/11619597.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama said</a>, “Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett. There’s no justification for it.” Here are more predictions on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/01/24/State-of-the-Union-Experts-Predict-Obamas-Message.aspx#page1" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama’s projected message</a>.

<p><strong>Ron Paul (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>After his son Sen. Rand Paul’s refusal to commit to a full body pat down by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) yesterday, Ron Paul has launched a money-bomb in his campaign to “end the TSA.” For full text of Paul’s release and more information on his money-bomb, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/rand-paul-tsa-ron-paul-fundraiser_n_1227257.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post’s article</a>. In last night’s debate, Texas Congressman Paul&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/ron-paul-newt-gingrich-find-common-ground/" rel="noopener noreferrer">focused on the Federal Reserve</a>, stating that he wants to see a firm value placed on the American dollar, an argument agreed to by Gingrich. Paul also hinted he would support Gingrich, if the former House Speaker would change his foreign policy to align with Paul’s.</p>

<p><strong>Buddy Roemer (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer has stuck by his decision to refrain from campaigning in Florida. Although he was excluded from the GOP debate last night, he commented on the debate on his&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BuddyRoemer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>&nbsp;account and continues to actively promote his candidacy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/6-Mitt-Romney.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img height="90" src="cloudinary://6-Mitt-Romney.png" width="90"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>While the absence of applause made it hard to define a clear winner, Huffington Post’s Sam Stein states&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/republican-presidential-debate-audience-silence_n_1225953.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was Romney</a>&nbsp;who gained ground on Monday night by making aggressive stabs at Newt Gingrich’s association with Freddie Mac. Romney stated at one point of the debate, “I don’t think we can possibly retake the White House if our nominee was a lobbyist for Freddie Mac.” In defense of his tax returns, he argued in Monday’s debate, “I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more.”</p>

<p><strong>Rick Santorum (Republican):&nbsp;</strong>In last night’s debate, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum seemed to take the back seat, blaming the media for pre-maturely portraying the Republican candidacy as a “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/24/politics/five-things-learned/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">two man race</a>.” Despite receiving less airtime than Romney and Gingrich, he delivered what NPR’s Debra Rosenberg believed to be the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/01/23/145679103/we-watched-so-you-dont-have-to-top-moments-of-the-gop-tampa-debate" rel="noopener noreferrer">best closing argument</a>, saying, “There is no difference between President Obama and these two gentlemen.”</p>
