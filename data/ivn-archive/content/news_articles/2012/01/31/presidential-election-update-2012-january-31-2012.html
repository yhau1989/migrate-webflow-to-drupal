<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1-Newt-Gingrich1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://1-Newt-Gingrich1.png" width="90"></a>Newt Gingrich (Republican):</strong> In the ten days since his South Carolina victory, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been slipping in the Florida polls in what looks like will become an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/florida-polls-open-romney-emerging-frontrunner-15477886" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy win</a> for Mitt Romney. According to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/newt-gingrich-versus-mitt-romney-a-guide-to-latest-charges/2012/01/30/gIQAHmZndQ_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, Gingrich is running behind because of a "deluge of negative campaign ads by Romney and his allies and the perception that Romney bested him in the last two debates." On top of that, Gingrich is <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/10332797-418/former-survivor-member-sues-newt-gingrich-for-using-eye-of-tiger.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">being sued</a>&nbsp;by a former member of the band Survivor for using the bandâ€™s 1982 hit "Eye of the Tiger" in his campaign ads without permission.</p>

The Washington Post speculates that his urging shows a desire for bipartisan cooperation. This proposal for legislation is intended to accelerate small business growth and provide support for startup companies by removing roadblocks. Obama asserted in his State of the Union Address last week that small businesses account for the majority of the nation's jobs. Obama is hoping his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/jan/31/obama-wants-small-business-bill-this-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus on small businesses</a> could win him bipartisan support even during an election year.</p>

Romney leveraged his Mormon faith to win a significant number of the state's Mormon voters, a strategy that Paul is trying to combat this time around by <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/ron-paul-is-placing-big-bets-on-nevada/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reiterating his allegiance</a> to the Constitution. Paul has already opened two offices in Nevada and has been running television ads in the state since late last summer. Speaking about Paul's strategy, ABC correspondent Jason Volack <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/ron-paul-is-placing-big-bets-on-nevada/" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggests</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Paul's focus on Nevada is part of a comprehensive plan to pick up delegates in caucus states where TV advertising is cheaper and independents can vote."</blockquote>

He did, however, recently participate in a tax talk with Forbes' Kelly Phillips. When asked what the single most important tax issue facing Americans today is, he responded: "Trust. Taxpayers can't read the Tax Code and they can't trust it. It's written by lobbyists and taxpayers don't think it's fair."

The <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/romney-confident-as-voters-1324441.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press reports</a>, "Romney is heavily favored in the winner-take-all primary" and will likely pick up the 50 delegates Florida has to offer. Optimistic about his Florida prospects and inspired by President Obama's impromptu rendition of Al Green's "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-hDt2E8MoE" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Stay Together</a>," Mitt Romney serenaded the Lake Sumter Market Square crowd with his own performance of "<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/01/mitt-romney-sings/48072/" rel="noopener noreferrer">America The Beautiful</a>" in The Villages, Florida.</p>

According to the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_19859326" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denver Post</a>, the Republican Party within Colorado is excited to have the GOP candidates come compete in the Colorado caucuses. Santorum and Paul will be the first candidates to campaign in the state this year. While Santorum continues his campaign, the health of his daughter Bella remains a top priority for him, initiating a discussion on the proper role of personal and professional conflicts in all of the candidates' lives.</p>
