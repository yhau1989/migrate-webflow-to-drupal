<blockquote>
<p>Mitt Romney earned&nbsp;<span>$21.6 million in 2010 — and <a href="http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/01/25/012512-news-romney-taxes-1-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="romney taxes">paid just 14% in taxes</a>, far less than&nbsp;</span>Newt Gingrich’s 31.7% or Obama’s 26.3%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>In fact, the Romneys paid a higher tax rate to foreign countries, handing over 18 percent on the almost $375,000 that they garnered abroad. The former Massachusetts governor also shelled out almost $3 million to charity, roughly 16 percent of his post-tax haul.</span></p>
