<p>On January 10, 2012,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/Bills/AB_1413/20112012/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A.B. 1413</a>&nbsp; by Assemblymember Paul Fong (D-Cupertino) unanimously passed the Senate’s California Senate’s Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee.&nbsp; The bill streamlines the election process to ensure that California's new "top two" open primary election system is efficient and cost effective.&nbsp; Because it was determined the legislation does not create any additional state costs or appropriation of state funds and will cause no significant reduction in revenues, it will now be moved from committee, placed on second reading and move to the Senate floor.</p>
