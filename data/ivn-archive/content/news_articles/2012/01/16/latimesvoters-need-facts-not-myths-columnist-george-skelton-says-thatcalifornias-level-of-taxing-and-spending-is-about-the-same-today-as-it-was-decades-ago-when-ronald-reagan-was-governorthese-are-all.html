<blockquote>
<p><strong>Voters need facts, not myths: </strong>Columnist George Skelton says that&nbsp;California’s level of taxing and spending is about the same today as it was decades ago, when Ronald Reagan was governor.</p>
<p>These are all myths, according to Skelton:</p>
<ol><li>There’s no such thing as a <em>temporary</em>&nbsp;tax increase. They all become permanent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Taxes have gone through the roof in California.&nbsp; </li>
<li>California’s spending has been out of control.&nbsp; </li>
<li>California suffers from an exceptionally bloated bureaucracy.&nbsp; </li>
<li>California teachers are pampered and overpaid.</li>
