<p>The Washington Post has provided some great resources for tracking the <strong>2012 Presidential Election</strong>. Here are a few of our favorite at <a href="http://ivn.us" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN.us</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidential-campaign-ads-2012/?tid=rr_mod" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracking TV ads in the Presidential Campaign!&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><em>Great site to watch recent campaign ads, see how much each candidate is spending on ads, and the top messages in the 2012 presidential election ads.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/primary-tracker/New-Hampshire/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican Primary Tracker</a></p>
<p><em>Let’s you see the campaign trails of all the candidates in each state before and after their caucuses or primary, with an updated map of where each candidate is visiting within the state, previous winners in the state, and the demographics of the state.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/campaign-finance/?tid=rr_mod" rel="noopener noreferrer">Campaign Finance Explorer&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><em>A feature that let’s you see just how much each candidate is raising for their campaign, how much they are spending, and what kinds of contributions they are receiving.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Enjoy!&nbsp;</p>
