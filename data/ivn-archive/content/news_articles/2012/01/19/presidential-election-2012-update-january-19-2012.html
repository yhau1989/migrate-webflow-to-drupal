<p><em>A periodic review of the current presidential election campaigns:</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012election.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="107" src="cloudinary://2012election-300x298.jpg" width="108"></a></strong></p>

<p>And then there were four. Just two days before the South Carolina primary, Rick Perry publicly announces his <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/19/breaking-perry-endorses-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">withdrawal from the race</a> for presidency, leaving Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum the four standing contenders for the 2012 Republican candidacy. While acknowledging his imperfections, the Texas Governor endorsed former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich by <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/19/breaking-perry-endorses-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">naming him</a> a "conservative leader who can bring about real change." The four remaining candidates will square off in the 17th Republican Presidential Debate tonight at 8 p.m. ET on CNN.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1-Newt-Gingrich.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://1-Newt-Gingrich.png" width="90"></a>Newt Gingrich (Republican):</strong> After receiving the endorsement of Rick Perry, Gingrich is reported as saying he is "<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/19/breaking-perry-endorses-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">honored and very humbled</a>" to have the support of Perry. The endorsement comes just in time for the last Presidential Debate before the South Carolina primary and solidifies <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/01/gingrich-leads-romney-on-1st-night-of-tracking.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gingrich's recent lead</a> in the South Carolina polls.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2-Barack-Obama.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://2-Barack-Obama.png" width="90"></a>Barack Obama (Democrat): </strong>After delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday, polls show that President Obama's biggest hurdle may be gaining the support of the swing voters. A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/us/politics/poll-shows-obamas-vulnerability-with-swing-voters.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times/CBS News poll</a> reports that just 31% of swing voters are in favor of re-electing Obama, with two-thirds unsatisfied with his handling of the economy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3-Ron-Paul.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://3-Ron-Paul.png" width="90"></a>Ron Paul (Republican): </strong>Today was a big day in the polls for Texas Congressman Ron Paul. The first of two significant polls released today is a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/south_carolina/election_2012_south_carolina_republican_primary" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rasmussen Report</a> South Carolina poll that places Paul in front of former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum by four percentage points. The second is a <a href="http://ivn.us/news/2012/01/19/polls-show-ron-paul-emerging-as-key-player-in-2012-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center poll</a> that predicts a third-party bid for Paul would likely hurt Romney more than Obama, taking away 17% of Romney's independent support while only 9% of Obama's.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4-Rick-Perry1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://4-Rick-Perry1.png" width="90"></a>Rick Perry</strong> <strong>(Republican):</strong>&nbsp; After placing fifth in Iowa, last in New Hampshire, and polling with a mere 4% in South Carolina, Rick Perry publicly announces Thursday morning that he will end his campaign for the 2012 Republican Presidency.&nbsp; Speaking of his campaign, <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/perry-to-end-bid-for-presidency/?emc=na" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry admits</a>, "there is no viable path forward for me," a concession that was followed by his endorsement of Newt Gingrich.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5-Buddy-Roemer.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://5-Buddy-Roemer.png" width="90"></a>Buddy Roemer (Republican): </strong>Insistent on his stance against campaign finances, former Governor of Louisiana Buddy Roemer is still struggling to get invited to the Republican debates. While today's <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/01/gingrich-leads-romney-on-1st-night-of-tracking.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Policy poll</a> shows Roemer with 3%, it's not enough to meet the criteria for inclusion, mandating candidates poll at 1% in 5 national polls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/6-Mitt-Romney.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://6-Mitt-Romney.png" width="90"></a></strong><strong>Mitt Romney (Republican):</strong> While Mitt Romney continues to lead the pack as the clear front-runner in GOP race, a new Public Policy poll shows Romney's lead in South Carolina has slipped and he is now in second place with 28% of the vote, surpassed by Gingrich's 34%. The Rasmussen Report poll confirms Gingrich's lead, but <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/polls/205175-gingrich-overtakes-romney-in-two-more-south-carolina-polls" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill speculates</a>, "this is not a case of Romney fading," saying he will have time to defend himself in tonight's CNN debate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/7-Rick-Santorum.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://7-Rick-Santorum.png" width="90"></a>Rick Santorum (Republican):</strong> After careful review, the results from the Iowa caucuses show that it was actually Santorum who finished ahead with <a href="http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2012/01/19/register-exclusive-2012-gop-caucus-count-unresolved/" rel="noopener noreferrer">34 more votes</a> than Mitt Romney. Despite the numbers, GOP officials are adamant in calling the verdict a "<a href="http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2012/01/19/register-exclusive-2012-gop-caucus-count-unresolved/" rel="noopener noreferrer">split decision</a>."&nbsp; In an interview for CNN's The Situation Room, Santorum tells Wolf Blitzer that he found out about his official victory in Iowa early this morning, and pardons Iowa by acknowledging that "<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/19/polls-south-carolina-primary-tightening-hours-before-crucial-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">they had to go through the process</a>."</p>
