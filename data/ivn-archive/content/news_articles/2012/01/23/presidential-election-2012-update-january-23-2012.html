<p>After a hectic weekend in South Carolina, the candidates start their campaigning in Florida with another Presidential Debate tonight, hosted by NBC. For a recap of the South Carolina Primary results:</p>
<blockquote>Newt Gingrich: 40.4%, Mitt Romney: 27.8%, Rick Santorum: 17%, Ron Paul: 13%, and Other: 1.4%</blockquote>
<p>What's more important than these percentages, however, is&nbsp;<a href="http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/delegates" rel="noopener noreferrer">the actual numbers of delegates</a> distributed in South Carolina. Of the 25 delegates up for grabs, Gingrich won 23, bringing his total number of delegates up to 25, just 8 behind Mitt Romney's 33. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul did not receive any delegates from the South Carolina Primary and their total number of delegates remains at 14 and 4, respectively. Florida, with its winner-takes-all system, will be a defining moment for one candidate, as the winner will take all 50 delegates, placing them ahead of the pack.</p>

A new <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/florida/2012_florida_republican_primary" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rasmussen Reports poll</a> shows that after his win in South Carolina, the former Speaker of the House surged to 41% support, surpassing Mitt Romney's 32%. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/newt-gingrichs-rise--in-one-chart/2012/01/23/gIQAKtFTLQ_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> credits Gingrich's performance in last week's debates and his recent win in the primary to his soaring numbers.</p>

His presence on Google+ will add to his arsenal of social media weapons, making him a dominant force on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Youtube and Instagram, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2012/01/president-obama-to-answer-youtube-questions-in-google-plus-hangout-january-30.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>.

He will not, however, campaign in Florida because of its size and his lack of resources. Ron Paul announced in <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2012/0123/Ron-Paul-plans-to-skip-Florida.-Will-his-strategy-backfire" rel="noopener noreferrer">his speech</a> after the South Carolina primary on Saturday that, "when you win elections and you win delegates, that's the way you promote a cause." Because Florida has a winner-takes-all system for distributing its 50 delegates, Paul will focus on states in the West and North to pursue delegates and promote his cause.</p>
