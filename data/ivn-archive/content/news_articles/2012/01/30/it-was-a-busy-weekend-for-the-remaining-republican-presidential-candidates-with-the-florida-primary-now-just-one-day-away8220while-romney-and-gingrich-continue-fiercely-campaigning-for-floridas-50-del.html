<p>“While Romney and Gingrich continue fiercely campaigning for Florida’s 50 delegates, Ron Paul traveled to Maine to get a head start on the February caucuses and Rick Santorum returned home to take care of some personal issues. Buddy Roemer plans to stay in Florida today to attend a civil liberties conference.”</p>
