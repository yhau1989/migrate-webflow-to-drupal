<p>It was a busy weekend for the remaining Republican presidential candidates, with the Florida primary now just one day away. Because Florida is one of the nation's most competitive states in the general election, Tuesday's results will be an important indication of which candidate could be more successful in a race against President Obama. While Romney and Gingrich continue fiercely campaigning for Florida's 50 delegates, Ron Paul traveled to Maine to get a head start on the February caucuses and Rick Santorum returned home to take care of some personal issues. Buddy Roemer plans to stay in Florida today to attend a civil liberties conference.</p>

<p><strong>On the campaign trail...</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1-Newt-Gingrich1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://1-Newt-Gingrich1.png" width="90"></a>Newt Gingrich (Republican)</strong>: On Saturday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich received an endorsement from former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. Speaking of his recent endorsement, Cain <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/herman-cain-to-endorse-newt-gingrich/2012/01/28/gIQAG2KnYQ_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">described Gingrich</a> as a "patriot" and "not afraid of bold ideas." The endorsement came right before the release of the <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/29/10260572-nbcmarist-poll-romney-up-15-over-gingrich-in-florida" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC/Marist poll</a>, which shows Gingrich trailing behind Romney by 15 points in Florida.&nbsp; The Wall Street Journal reports this may be because of his <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203920204577191304068334144.html?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy" rel="noopener noreferrer">slipping support</a> from Republican women. Despite his second place ranking in Florida, Newt Gingrich is still leading Romney in the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">national polls</a> by 2.8 points.</p>

The Obama administration has been hard at work over the past few months promoting executive actions that favor the Latino population, like Obama's plans to change the green-card policy and his promise to review all pending deportation cases. While these stories are not in the mainstream media, they have been circulating among the Spanish media, and according to a <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/72110.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent POLITICO article</a>,&nbsp;"Latino advocates say they've notice a new level of engagement from the White House."</p>

Weighing his options, Ron Paul decided to focus his attention on campaigning in Maine while the rest of the candidates focused on tomorrow's primary. With 24 delegates available, Maine's caucuses are being held February 4-11. Paul continues his campaign to end the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA), <a href="http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/01/ron-paul-tsa-is-a-bureaucratic-monster-that-undermines-our-liberties-and-doesnt-make-us-safe/" rel="noopener noreferrer">citing</a> the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protection against unwarranted searches and seizures as reason to abolish the TSA.</p>

The ACLU extended an invitation to 7 Presidential Candidates, encouraging them to address their views on key constitutional issues and defend their <a href="http://www.aclulibertywatch.org/ALWCandidateReportCard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACLU Liberty Watch 2012 Candidate Report Card</a> scores. Of the candidates, Gary Johnson and Buddy Roemer are the only two to accept.</p>

A new <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-27/swing-states-poll/52871890/1" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA TODAY/Gallup poll</a> reveals that when matched up against President Obama, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is statistically tied while Newt Gingrich trails the president by 14 percentage points. The poll was taken in the nation’s twelve most competitive swing states, a factor that may help Romney in his fight for the Republican presidential nomination. In response to Romney's lead in the polls, rival Newt Gingrich argues, "He hasn't won the majority of votes in any primary," and warns that Romney cannot rally the Republican Party.</p>
