<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jonhuntsmanjr" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Huntsman</a> threw his two cents into the media cycle on Friday afternoon after announcing that he will not be attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay this summer.</p>

<p>The former presidential candidate joins a growing list of Republicans who are skipping the Republican National Convention. Republican Connecticut Senate candidate and former World Wrestling Entertainment executive, Linda McMahon, is passing on the gathering.</p>

<p>Other candidates who have chosen to skip the convention include: Former VA Sen. George Allen, MT Rep. Denny Rehberg, and NV Sen. Dean Heller.</p>

<p>The former Utah Governor and Ambassador is the biggest name to opt out and the only one not actively on the campaign trail. In another anti-partisan statement Mr. Huntsman <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/linda-mcmahon-other-republicans-plan-skip-gop-convention-150147281.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“I will not be attending this year’s convention, nor any Republican convention in the future, until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States – a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.”</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to seeing if this will spur any other big names to pass on the convention in a movement toward supporting the American people above the national party.</p>
