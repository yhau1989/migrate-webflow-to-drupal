<p>After a discussion about July 4th plans, a friend of mine sent over a clip from the new HBO show 'The Newsroom' where Jeff Daniels responds to a student who asks why America is the greatest country in the world. A liberal commentator cites "diversity and opportunity" while a conservative points to "freedom and freedom." After a bit of prodding Jeff Daniels' character unleashes a tirade regarding how great America was and how we have fallen away from what made us great. Watch below. Let us know your thoughts. Regardless of your response, have a great July 4th!</p>
