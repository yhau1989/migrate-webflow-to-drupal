<p>Today, most Americans are celebrating the Fourth of July, our nation's Independence Day. For many it means family, friends, fireworks, delicious barbeque treats and a medley of making everything possible red white and blue. Its also means freedom, patriotism and pride--a perfect American cocktail for campaigning. So what do our hopeful leaders have planned for July 4th?</p>

<p>Republican nominee hopeful, <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>, will be taking the entire week off for an annual family reunion at his New Hampshire vacation home. Part of this reunion includes the "Romney Olympics", where the 30-something members of the family clan compete in swimming, running and, fittingly enough, who can hang on a pole for the longest. Gov. Romney will squeeze just a little campaigning into the weekend however, by marching in the local Wolfeboro, New Hampshire Fourth of July parade.</p>

<p>Gov. Romney isn't the only one working politics into this holiday weekend. Candidates <strong>Ron Paul</strong> and <strong>Gary Johnson</strong> will be marching in parades and holding parties of their own. Gov. Johnson will be hosting a BBQ at Historic Langford Park in Orlando, Florida on July 4th, starting at 2:00 pm. The event is on Facebook and Johnson says, “I would enjoy having you and your family come celebrate Independence Day with me. I hope to meet and converse with all of you.”</p>

<p>Dr. Paul has posted an update on his website proclaiming his participation in a parade in his district. He then went on to say “but after that I want to take a little bit time off and spend some time at a family barbeque and at home. And I know a lot of you will those same types of festivities on this particular day.”</p>

<p><strong>President Barack Obama</strong> will be spending his Fourth of July at home, after a weekend at Camp David with his family. The president is hosting a picnic on the White House’s South Lawn and is in honor of military families and his administration staff and their families. It is also Maliah Obama's birthday. Thursday, President&nbsp; Obama leaves for a two-day swing state bus tour.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy: former<strong> President George W. Bush</strong> will be spending the holiday volunteering in a cancer clinic in Kawbe, Zambia. There has been no press release regarding the subject but Andrew Kaczynski of BuzzFeed had this photo on Twitter:</p>
