<p>Today's infographic is the second in an infographic series with detailed and visually-arresting educational material about the modern industrial economy and its complexity. Yesterday's infographic was about the <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/28/the-xl-keystone-pipeline-project-infographic" rel="noopener noreferrer">XL Keystone Pipeline Project</a>. Next weekend, we'll cover other interesting resources and aspects of the industrial economy.</p>

<p>Tungsten is unique in its extremes. It’s extremely hard, heat resistant, dense, and environmentally benign. It’s used to make cemented carbide, one of the strongest and most durable compounds.</p>

<p>Tungsten’s supply is dominated by China, who has significant influence on its price. China holds 2/3 of Tungsten’s world reserves and produces 60,000 of the world’s 72,000 tonnes per year.</p>
