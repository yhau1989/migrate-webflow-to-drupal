<p>The elder former President Bush and his wife recently sat down for an interview with Parade magazine. Here's what he had to say about Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform pledge:</p>
<blockquote><em>"The rigidity of those pledges is something I don’t like. The circumstances change and you can’t be wedded to some formula by Grover Norquist. It’s—who the hell is Grover Norquist, anyway?"</em></blockquote>
