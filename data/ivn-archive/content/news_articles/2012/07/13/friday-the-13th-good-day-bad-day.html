<p>For those of you who are&nbsp;superstitious, Friday the 13th is not your lucky day. As for business owners, studies&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/trending/2012/07/13/friday_the_13th_this_week_s_unlucky_day.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggest</a>&nbsp;a total loss of&nbsp;$800 million in productivity in the United States on today's date.</p>

<p>But for those of you following the stock market, today might just be your lucky day, with&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nasdaq.com/News/2012-07/lucky-friday-the-13th-for-jpmorgan-analyst-blog.aspx?storyid=155625#ixzz20WKs57rH" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a>&nbsp;second quarter earnings per share of $1.21, way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.</p>
<blockquote>JPMorgan's better-than-expected earnings signal good going by the sector. A marked recovery of the bond and equity market and the consequent strong performances by its business segments, which helped JPMorgan overcome its difficulties to a great extent, should lift the results of other mega banks during the quarter.</blockquote>
<p>There's more good news. ABC reports that the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pasadenahumane.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pasadena, Calif., Humane Society and SPCA</a>&nbsp;will launch a&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;to encourage prospective pet owners to adopt black cats, the notoriously unlucky symbol of Friday the 13th.&nbsp;Starting today, adoption fees have been dropped to $13, including a spay and nueter, microchip, the first set of vaccines, and the health visit.</p>
