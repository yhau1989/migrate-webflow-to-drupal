<p>In wake of the tragic Colorado shooting in the city of Aurora, our country's leaders spoke to rally the spirits of the people and send their&nbsp;condolences to the victims and their families. Here's what they had to say.</p>

<p>Mayor of Aurora, CO Steve Hogan spoke publicly Friday morning. He showed a tremendous emotional reaction, but<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/aurora-mayor-we-will-survive-this/2012/07/20/gJQAyUoRyW_video.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> had this to say to respond to the incident</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>"To those folks with kids, no matter if they're small or teenagers, let's talk to them. Talk to them. They're going to feel this. It's going to come out. We have to do our duty as parents and civic officials...let them know this is an isolated incident."</em></blockquote>
<p>Congressman Mike Coffman of Colorado's 6th District, which encompasses Aurora, <a href="http://thehill.com/video/house/239193-colorado-congressman-shooting-a-shock-to-aurora-community-" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke to CBS saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>&nbsp;"It is just such a shock to the mayor, such a shock to me, and to the whole community. I've lived in Aurora almost all my life and nothing like this has ever happened here.&nbsp;I served in Iraq with the United States Marine Corps and I certainly expected incidents to occur, this level of violence, in Iraq, but never at home in Aurora, Colorado."</em></blockquote>
<p>Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was the victim of the 2011 shooting in Tuscon, AZ. Her husband, Mark Kelly, tweeted this:</p>
