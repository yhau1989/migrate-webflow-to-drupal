<p>The good folks at Google Ideas, Tribeca Enterprises and the Council on Foreign Relations met last week for the Info Summit 2012 to discuss the ever-interesting topic of "Illicit Networks".</p>

<p>From Info Summit:</p>
<blockquote><em>Global illicit networks — from drug smuggling and arms dealing, to human trafficking and organ harvesting — affect millions of people across the world, bringing in over $2.1 trillion every year.</em>

<em>The initiative does not stop at the event: a series of projects inspired by the summit will continue to be developed over the coming months. Watch this space for updates on the outputs.</em></blockquote>
<p>If you are like most people, you were not invited to Info Summit 2012. No big deal, the conference set up a YouTube account and have begun adding videos of various talks occurring over the multi-day meeting.</p>

<p>Like this one, on Disrupting Illicit Arms:</p>
