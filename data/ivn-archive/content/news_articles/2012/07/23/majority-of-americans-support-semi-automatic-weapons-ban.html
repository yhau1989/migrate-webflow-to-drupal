<p>The recent tragedy in Aurora, Colorado has prompted a variety of responses from lawmakers on the issue of <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/23/doj-study-fails-show-1994-assault-weapons-ban-worked/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gun control</a> and a semi-automatic weapons ban. Senator Dianne Feinstein said Sunday on Fox News Sunday,<em> "</em>weapons of war don't belong on the streets."</p>

<p>New York mayor Bloomberg called on President Obama to act. "Yes, we have great sympathy for the families, but it's time for this country to do something," Bloomberg said on CBS. "And that's the job of the president of the United States."</p>

<p>Back in 2011, the shooting of Arizona Representative Giffords prompted Time magazine to ask Americans if the federal government should ban the sale of semi-automatic assault weapons, with bi-partisan support for a ban.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.srbi.com/Constitution_Poll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">results</a> show: 73% of Democrats, 61% of Independents, and 49% of Republicans agree that semi-automatic weapons should be banned.</p>
