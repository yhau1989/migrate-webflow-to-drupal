<p>John McCain (R-AZ) tells a reporter why he voted against the DISCLOSE Act, two days in a row:</p>
<blockquote><em>"The fundamental here," he said, "is the way you do any reform is on a bipartisan basis. This is totally a partisan bill. We all know that. It's not going to pass. It's for a political purpose. I resent that, having been involved, with Sen. Feingold, in campaign finance reform that was indeed meaningful. Unfortunately, the United States Supreme Court gutted it. But the fact is, everybody knows it has to be done on a bipartisan basis. They have chosen to attack this issue on a partisan basis, for partisan reasons."</em>
