<p>To kick off our first offical post, we decided to bring some facts <a href="http://www.poetpatriot.com/poltriviavote.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">we found</a> on the history of voting in America. Enjoy!</p>

<p>1. When the US began, only white, property owning males could vote- so not women or african americans.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;You must be 35 years old to be president, 30 to be U.S. senator, 25 to be a U.S. House member.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;The Republican Party was formed in 1854 out of the sentiment that slavery should be abolished.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;The Voting age was 21 and only lowered to 18 in 1971.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;The United States has had more Vice Presidents than Presidents.</p>
