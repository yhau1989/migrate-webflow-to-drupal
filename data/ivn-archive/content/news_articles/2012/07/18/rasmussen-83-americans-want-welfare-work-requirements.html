<p>As we enter almost 5 years of the economic downturn, we have more welfare recipients than ever. &nbsp;And, with local, state, and federal budget deficits coming under public fire, Americans are overwhelmingly in support of adding welfare work requirements to our current programs.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/jobs_employment/july_2012/83_favor_work_requirement_for_welfare_recipients" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rasmussen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Most Americans think there are too many people on welfare who should not be getting it and believe overwhelmingly&nbsp;that&nbsp;those who do receive welfare benefits should be required to work.</blockquote>
