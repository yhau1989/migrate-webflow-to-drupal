<p>As the primary season for the 2012 election has ended, all sides are now focused on the general election and the march to Election Day in November. &nbsp;On that day, millions of Americans will go to their local polling place and cast a vote for President/Vice-President. &nbsp;Some will choose the Democratic candidate, some will choose the Republican candidate, and some will choose a third-party candidate such as the Green Party or Libertarian Party. &nbsp;When we walk out of those voting booths, we feel as if we've had our voices heard and that the will of the people will be done. &nbsp;But wait just a moment. &nbsp;The popular vote won't determine who are next president is, and it never has in the past. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;The Electoral College has the final say.</p>

<p><a href="http://indeclaration.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/electoral-map.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="223" src="cloudinary://electoral-map.png" title="electoral-map" width="300"></a>So what is the Electoral College? &nbsp;"The Electoral College consists of the electors appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>) &nbsp;When we cast our vote for President/Vice-President, we aren't casting a vote for the candidates, but rather their electors to the Electoral College. &nbsp;Each state determines how it will choose who those electors are for their state. &nbsp;In most states, those electors must vote for the candidate that won the state's popular vote. &nbsp;There have been instances of rogue votes, but most states have passes laws that forbid that practice. &nbsp;In all but two states, it's winner take all. &nbsp;Even if Candidate A gets just one more vote that Candidate B, Candidate A gets all of the electoral votes. &nbsp;The two states that don't practice this are Maine and Nebraska. &nbsp;The winner automatically receives two electoral votes, and then the remainder are given out based on the winner of each congressional district. &nbsp;In 2008, Senator John McCain handily won the state of Nebraska, but he only received 4 out of the 5 electoral votes because then-Senator Barack Obama won the congressional district encompassing Omaha, thereby, receiving one of the votes. &nbsp;The number of electoral votes a state gets is based on the number of seats in the House of Representatives each state has + the two seats in the Senate. &nbsp;Nebraska, for instance, has three congressional districts. &nbsp;Add that to the two Senate seats to get 5 electoral votes. &nbsp;DC is granted 3 electoral votes despite no official representation in Congress via the 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution.</p>

<p>So why did our Founding Fathers enshrine this Electoral College system into our Constitution? &nbsp;In essence, they didn't feel that the common man was not informed enough to elect the leader of the country. &nbsp;Originally, as proposed under the Virginia Plan at the Constitutional Convention, the idea was for Congress to decide who the President was. &nbsp;This eventually led to the compromise of each state deciding how it would determine its own electors. &nbsp;James Madison and James Wilson, along with many other delegates, still supported popular election though they admitted that it would difficult to do with southern votes and the 3/5ths compromise that had been reached regarding slavery in that region.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
<em>Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the US Constitution~</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in all the presidential elections dating back to George Washington, there have only been a handful of times when the popular vote was overturned by the electoral college. &nbsp;The first of these being in 1824 between Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and General Andrew Jackson. &nbsp;Jackson had won both the popular vote and electoral vote, but he didn't win enough of the popular vote since there were four candidates altogether. &nbsp;A candidate must receive 50.1% of the electoral vote to win... which in today's time is 270. &nbsp;Any candidate that fails to win that number cannot be declared the winner, and the election is thrown into the House of Representatives per the US Constitution. &nbsp;And the House of Representatives, in that instance, under the leadership of Henry Clay, elected John Quincy Adams. &nbsp;Jackson would beat Adams outright 4-years later. &nbsp;The instances of the popular vote winner not receiving a majority of the electoral vote include the years 1876 (Hayes vs. Tilden), 1888 (Harrison vs. Cleveland), and 2000 (Gore vs. Bush).</p>
<p>Since 2000 there has been a growing number of people across the country that have wanted to reform or even abolish the Electoral College and move toward a more direct, popular election... the same as we do for all our other elected officials. &nbsp;Gallup determined that in October 2011, 62% of Americans were in favor or a popular election for President/Vice-President with 35% wanting to remain with the current system. &nbsp;Of that 62%, there is a bipartisan appeal... 71% of Democrats, 53% of Republicans, and 46% of Independents. &nbsp;So how would we change the system if we decided to go that route? &nbsp;Since the Electoral College is enshrined in our Constitution, it would require a constitutional amendment... which means we, the people, wouldn't have a direct say in the matter. &nbsp;An amendment to the US Constitution becomes valid after it passes both houses of Congress by 2/3rds vote and then is ratified by 3/4ths of the state legislatures. &nbsp;It is not an easy process.</p>
<p>So should we be trying to change how we elect our President/Vice-President when it would be such a daunting task? &nbsp;We've changed it before via the 12th Amendment. &nbsp;But for this particular instance, one could go either way. &nbsp;There have only been four times in all of our elections when the two have not been one in the same. &nbsp;In all but the four elections mentioned earlier (1824, 1872, 1888, and 2000), the winner of the popular vote won the electoral vote. &nbsp;In that instance, there lies no problems. &nbsp;But, as Americans, we take great pride in electing our leaders. &nbsp;And though it may seem like we are voting for a certain candidate, in reality, we are not. &nbsp;It seems rather shocking to us here in the 21st century. &nbsp;Then there is the added question that if we were to keep the Electoral College, should we change the rules so that it's not winner take all? &nbsp;Should it be more in line with Nebraska and Maine where the winner is granted two electoral votes automatically and then the rest are apportioned by each congressional district won? &nbsp;In 2000, George W. Bush won the state of Florida (thus granting him victory in the election) by 1,784 votes. &nbsp;Maybe a compromise plan would even work. &nbsp;If the difference in votes is less than 10%, then it would be awarded proportionally, but it would be winner take all if it was more than 10%. &nbsp;What about a plan where the Electoral College remains in place as it currently is, but can be overturned if the popular vote is different? &nbsp;Along those lines is a similar plan called the National Popular Vote Compact in which states would award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. &nbsp;Eight states have signed on, though none have been officially enacted. &nbsp;Regardless of whatever path we decide to go down in the future, we must keep in mind that for 224-years, the process has been mostly correct, and we might be making a bigger deal over something that isn't.</p>

George Washington is the only person to receive a unanimous vote from the Electoral College. &nbsp;He received it in both elections. &nbsp;Though James Monroe ran unopposed for a second-term, one electoral delegate did not cast his vote for him so that Washington would remain the sole person to receive that honor. &nbsp;Ronald Reagan came close in 1984, when he received the votes of 49 of 50 states (also minus DC).</p>
