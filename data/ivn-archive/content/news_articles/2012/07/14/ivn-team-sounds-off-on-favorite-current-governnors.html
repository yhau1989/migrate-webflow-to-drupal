<p>In honor of the National Governors' Association meeting taking place through Sunday, the question, "Who is your favorite current governor, and why?", was posed to the office this week. Here are a few of our responses.</p>

<p>Chad Peace:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I would have to say <strong>Governor Lincoln Chafee</strong> of Rhode Island because <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/12/10-facts-on-independent-governor-lincoln-chafee/" rel="noopener noreferrer">after reading the article</a> [IVN intern] Michael wrote on our site, it sounds like he stands up to the GOP a lot...I like that"</em></blockquote>
<p>Matt Metzner:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I have a lot of respect for Montana's <strong>Governor Brian Schweitzer</strong> and his Republican Lieutenant Governor for collectively leading the charge against Citizens United and defending an 100 year old law that has worked for their state."</em></blockquote>
<p>Jane Susskind:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I've lived in California all my life, so I'm partial to any governor representing my state. But <strong>Governor Jerry Brown</strong> has made some bold decisions that place him at the top of my list as my favorite current governor. California faces some tough obstacles, with an almost $16 billion deficit. Brown has made a commitment to closing this gap, knowing that the 2012 budget cuts and $8 billion tax increase will be highly unpopular. I'm not a fan of taxes, but California is struggling, people are leaving, and it's one of the worst states for unemployment. He has a tough job, and I can respect a governor who does what he or she thinks is right, not what is popular."</em></blockquote>
<p>Amos Cooper:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I like <strong>Governor Rick Perry</strong> because he's funny. Just look..."</em>

<p>Manny Flores:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I like <strong>Governor Chris Christie</strong>. He called our War on Drugs <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/11/new-jersey-governor-chris-christie-war-on-drugs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a failure</a>. He's got balls, bro."</em></blockquote>
