<p>On Friday, Barack Obama signed the US-Israel&nbsp;Enhanced&nbsp;Security Cooperation&nbsp;Act of 2012.</p>

<p>First&nbsp;announced by bill sponsors Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Representative Howard Berman (D-CA) in May, the recent act provides Israel &nbsp;with an additional $70 million for the funding of their missile&nbsp;defense&nbsp;system.&nbsp;The system, known as Iron Dome, has proved successful at stopping rocket attacks fired at Israeli civilians from close range, including from Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israelis will be looking to&nbsp;upgrade their new and improved Interceptor&nbsp;missile&nbsp;with the funding.</p>
<blockquote><em>"The main difference between the two models of the missile is the warhead, where the system that makes the missile “smart” is located,” explained a commander in the Israeli Air&nbsp;Defense&nbsp;Formation according to <a href="http://www.defencetalk.com/israel-to-upgrade-iron-dome-missile-radar-43979/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defense Talk</a>."</em></blockquote>
<p>President Obama&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;America’s "unshakable commitment to Israel," and praised the Iron Dome defense system as “critical” in defending the nation’s citizens from missile strikes.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I have made it a top priority for my&nbsp;administration&nbsp;to deepen cooperation with Israel across the whole spectrum of security issues,&nbsp;intelligence, military technology."</em>

<em>"We are standing by our friends in Israel when it comes to these kinds of attacks."</em></blockquote>
<p>President Obama also talked about the suicide bombing in Bulgaria targeting Israeli tourists.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Let me just close by saying that the tragic events that we saw in Bulgaria emphasize the degree to which this continues to be a challenge not just for Israel, but for the entire world -- preventing terrorist attacks and making sure the people of Israel are not targeted."</em></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Defense&nbsp;Secretary&nbsp;Leon Panetta will travel &nbsp;to Israel in order to discuss cooperative measures on&nbsp;defense&nbsp;and security issues according to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/27/politics/obama-israel/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, President Obama signed the US-Israel&nbsp;Enhanced&nbsp;Security&nbsp;Cooperation&nbsp;Act&nbsp;prior to Governor Mitt&nbsp;Romney's much anticipated arrival in Israel. Critics consider the signing of this act a&nbsp;political&nbsp;maneuver&nbsp;in obtaining votes in a year of the presidential election.</p>
