<p>Four facts &amp; four charts to help explain the June jobs report:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The unemployment rate was unchanged in June at 8.2%.</li>
	<li>U.S. employers added only 80,000 jobs in June, a third straight month of weak hiring that shows the economy is still struggling three years after the recession ended.</li>
	<li>The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits declined by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 374,000 in the week ending June 30.</li>
	<li>Nevada, Rhode Island and California have the highest unemployment among U.S. states.</li>
</ul>
