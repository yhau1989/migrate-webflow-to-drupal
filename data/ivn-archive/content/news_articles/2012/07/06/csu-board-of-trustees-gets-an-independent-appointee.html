<p>While many independents look towards high-profile positions such as President or members of Congress for representation, a key towards future political success is occupying positions from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>Of note on the subject, the governor of California announced two appointments to the California State University Board of Trustees. One of the new appointees is registered as No Party Preference.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2012/07/gov-jerry-brown-appoints-2-to-cal-state-board-of-trustees.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacramento Bee</a> has the biography of Lupe Garcia:</p>
