<p>In the latest Mitt Romney health care flip-flop, here's a video picking up steam online that has the presidential hopeful discussing the similarities and differences between his plan in Massachusetts and Obama's plan in the ACA.</p>

<p>His praising of the similarities and distaste for the differences doesn't sound like the full repeal promise and state waivers Mitt is featuring on his campaign website.</p>

<p>I can't be the only one attempting to figure out what Romney thinks about a piece of legislation that is similar to his own and was successful in Massachusetts. I'm looking forward to Romney and Obama debating this issue and both candidates discussing the issue further.</p>

<p>Our health care debate is just beginning. Most of the provisions in the ACA have not taken effect and there are sure to be revisions to the law following the Supreme Court holding in support of it.</p>

<p>What we can do now is raise the question to both candidates about their goals for health care in the future and how they plan on fixing a system that many recognize is broken. As for now it seems safe to assume that the Mitt Romney health care plan is still being crafted. What would happen after he is elected is beyond anyone's guess at this point. </p>
