<p>The Bureau of Labor <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistics</a> for the June jobs report paints a grim picture for the economy, with just <strong>80,000 jobs</strong> added and a stagnant unemployment rate of <strong>8.2%</strong>.</p>

<p>Kathy Bostjancic, director of macroeconomic analysis for the Conference Board commented on the economic situation:</p>
<blockquote><em>“This economy has no forward momentum and little help from monetary or fiscal policy. As if that were not enough, ill winds are blowing in from both a contracting Europe and slowing growth in emerging markets. Also, domestic lawmakers’ inaction on the upcoming ‘fiscal cliff’ creates uncertainty that is not conducive to hiring.”</em></blockquote>
<p>Twitter reacts to the "unchanged" and "stagnant" jobs report:</p>
<blockquote>The June jobs report in one word: "unchanged." And that's not nearly good enough: <a href="http://t.co/Q7SVWe9P" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="http://wapo.st/M8QotJ">wapo.st/M8QotJ</a>
