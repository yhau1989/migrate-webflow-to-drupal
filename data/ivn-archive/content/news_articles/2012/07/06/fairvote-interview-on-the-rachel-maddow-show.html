<p>Last night, Rachel Maddow had <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FairVote.org</a> chair and Nirvana bassist, Krist Novoselic on her show to discuss putting the power of elections back in the hands of voters. It's an interesting interview and touches on the problematic two-party system.</p>
