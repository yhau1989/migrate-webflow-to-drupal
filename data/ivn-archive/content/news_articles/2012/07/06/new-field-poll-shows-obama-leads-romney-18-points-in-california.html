<p>A new Field Poll out today shows President Obama with a considerable lead over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/07/06/155176/poll-obama-leads-romney-by-18.html#storylink=cpy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacramento Bee's Torey Van Oot</a> has the details, including this interesting statistic:</p>
<blockquote><em>Even Romney's supporters in California have Obama on the mind. Sixty percent of surveyed voters backing the former Massachusetts governor said their decision is influenced primarily by their desire to get Obama out of office, not by their affinity for the GOP nominee.</em></blockquote>
