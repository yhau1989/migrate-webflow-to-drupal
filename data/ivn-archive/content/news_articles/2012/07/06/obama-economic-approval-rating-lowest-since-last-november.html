<p>This is sure to play in the hands of the GOP and Romney camp, who will undoubtedly use these statistics in their perpetual political game.</p>
<blockquote>The economy has been the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/importance_of_issues" rel="noopener noreferrer">most important issue to voters for years</a>, but ratings for the presidentâ€™s performance in that area are at their lowest level since last November.&nbsp; A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows just 31% of Likely Voters believe President Obama is doing a good or excellent job handling economic issues, including 12% who say he is doing an excellent job. Forty-eight percent (48%) believe Obama is doing a poor job in this area.
