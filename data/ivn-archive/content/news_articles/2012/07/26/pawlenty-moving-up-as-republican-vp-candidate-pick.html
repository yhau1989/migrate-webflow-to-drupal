<p>Rumor has it that Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty is moving up the ranks in the search for a Republican VP. Pawlenty was on John McCain’s shortlist in 2008 prior to McCain blessing us with Sarah Palin.</p>

<p>Tim Pawlenty is a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, served two terms as governor of Minnesota, and made a brief presidential run in 2011. Since dropping out of the race, he has been on the trail pushing Romney into the spotlight.</p>

<p>Aside from mere rumor of Pawlenty becoming the Republican VP, multiple liberal super PACs have been researching him in anticipation of Pawlenty getting the call. Apparently they have found a little <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/vice-president-pawlenty-three-attacks-democrats-may-against-095518041.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">dirt</a> on the Republican VP candidate.</p>

<p>The research that has been presented so far is relatively innocuous, the juiciest bit of information being a fine slapped on his gubernatorial campaign for improper coordination with the state party.</p>

<p>What I’m looking forward to is the selection of the Republican VP candidate. The announcement has been a long time coming at this point and it seems that Romney could use a bump in the <a href="http://www.politico.com/p/2012-election/polls/president/national/national-12-president-general-election-216/" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a>.</p>

<p>That extra kick from the Republican VP candidate might be less than hoped for with Pawlenty on the ticket. The former governor has a commendable record, but he lacks the charisma necessary to pull in new voters.</p>

<p>Tim Pawlenty is not going to be a great magnet for moderate voters that Republicans hope their VP choice would be. But he is also not the risky choice that Palin was in 2008. Going with the <a href="http://youtu.be/9OcjTGVwqzc" rel="noopener noreferrer">boring</a> white guy, former governor is a safe play for the Romney campaign. Not having a whole lot of skeletons in his closet also helps.</p>

<p>When the decision is made, expect a safe play, expect plenty of hype, and expect to be bored by the Republican VP candidate.</p>
