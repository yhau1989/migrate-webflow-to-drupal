<p>Much like the social media experiment put forth by <a href="https://twitter.com/sweden" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Sweden</a>, Vermont has joined the ranks as the first state in America to create a <a href="http://www.thisisvt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter handle</a> to be managed directly by the citizens of the state. Called <a href="https://twitter.com/THISISVT" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ThisisVT</a>, the Twitter account was created by the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing in an attempt to attract visitors to the state by providing first hand testimonials from the residents themselves. Each week, a new resident will have control over the Twitter account, to tweet as he or she pleases, answer questions, or post personal tweets about his or her life.</p>

<p>Some of this week's tweets from "This is Vermont" include:</p>

<p>According to Deputy Commissioner Steve Cook, Vermonters love Vermont. “This social media platform offers a tremendous opportunity for Vermonters to showcase their experiences and the Vermont Tourism team aims to share these stories with visitors or those considering relocating to our state.”</p>

<p>Do you think this will turn into another <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/06/13/social-media-experiment-gone-wrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Sonja" incident</a>, or will residents of Vermont woo travelers into visiting their beloved state?</p>
