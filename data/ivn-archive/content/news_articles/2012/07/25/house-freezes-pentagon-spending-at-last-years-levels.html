<p>Last week, the House approved a Pentagon budget bill of nearly $606 billion, $1.1 billion below the level recommended by the GOP leadership. Congratulations are in order for freshman Republican Mick Mulvaney (SC-5), and retiring Democrat Barney Frank (MA-4), for co-sponsoring&nbsp;the&nbsp;amendment&nbsp;that effectively froze&nbsp;spending at last year’s level.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78744.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="House approves $606B defense budget">According to <em>Politico</em>‘s David Rogers</a>, “the freeze marks a modest but still important turning point in the budget wars with 89 Republicans joining 158 Democrats on the key 247-167 vote.”</p>

<p>It is a modest step, but I’m encouraged that <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll495.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">88 Republicans</a> sided with&nbsp;Mulvaney. This should&nbsp;send a message to House Armed Services Committee chairman Howard P. “Buck” McKeon and others <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/author/christopher-preble/page/2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">who have claimed, falsely, that defense spending has been gutted in recent years</a>, or <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/being-a-global-power-on-469-bn-a-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">who contend, absurdly, that the United States cannot maintain its safety and security with a budget that&nbsp;is well above post–cold war levels</a>.</p>

<p>There is still much&nbsp;work to be done, however. The budget remains more than $6 billion above the spending caps set by last year’s Budget Control Act and doesn’t come close to meeting the levels dictated by the BCA’s sequestration provision that was supposed to go into effect when the deficit reduction supercommittee failed to hammer out a deal.</p>

<p>Indeed, although I am encouraged by the large number of Republicans who bucked their leadership and&nbsp;McKeon, it is troubling that any House member who claimed to care about deficit reduction and out-of-control spending by voting for the&nbsp;BCA would then vote for a budget that&nbsp;exceeds those caps.</p>

<p>An amendment that would conform with the BCA targets by cutting $7.5 billion from the top line&nbsp;garnered <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll489.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">just 24 Republican votes</a>. I haven’t yet bounced yesterday’s roll call against last year’s BCA vote, but members who voted for the BCA but against this amendment seem to be trying to have it both ways.</p>
