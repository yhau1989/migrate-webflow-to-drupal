<p>The Bay of Fundy between Maine and Canada, with its 50 foot tides, will now have the<a href="http://inhabitat.com/maine-launches-the-first-commercial-tidal-power-project-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> first commercial grid-tied tidal power</a> in the United States. The system will generate 3 MW, enough for 1,200 homes. Tidal power uses the movement of ocean water from incoming and outgoing tides to turn underwater devices, generating power.</p>

<p>While tidal power, like most renewable energy, is variable in power generation, it is also completely dependable as to when the power will be created.</p>
