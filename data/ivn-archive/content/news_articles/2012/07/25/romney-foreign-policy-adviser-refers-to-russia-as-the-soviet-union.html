<p>Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney made waves earlier this year by referring to Russia as the United States' "number one geopolitical foe". The Romney campaign appears once again stuck in a Cold War-era mindset, as a top foreign policy adviser for the presidential hopeful referred to Russia as the Soviet Union at a talk at the Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C. today. The comment comes just as Gov. Romney is set to depart on an international tour with stops to England, Poland and Israel.</p>
