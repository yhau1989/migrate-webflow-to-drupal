<p>The graphics team at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/20/us/drought-footprint.html?ref=business" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> has outdone itself with this interesting way of visualizing the current drought plaguing vast portions of the United States. Here in the office, we can't even remember the last time it rained. Granted, we are in San Diego...so that is expected.</p>

<p>But the current drought is no laughing matter, as we have <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/26/u-s-drought-worsens-congress-to-pass-relief-measure/" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered here at IVN</a>. Crops are dying and feeding livestock is about to become quite a headache, with resulting food prices expected to rise.</p>

<p>Take a look over at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/20/us/drought-footprint.html?ref=business" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> at how this year's prolific drought compares historically to past years.</p>
