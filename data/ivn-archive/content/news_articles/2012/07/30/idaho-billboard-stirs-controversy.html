<p>A political billboard comparing President Obama to the Colorado movie theater shooter is causing outrage in Iowa.</p>

<p>It shows side by side pictures of the suspected Colorado shooter and President Obama, in mid-laugh. It reads: "Kills 12 in movie theater with assault rifle, everyone freaks out. Kills thousands with his foreign policy, wins Nobel Peace Prize."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2012/07/27/2204070/does-political-billboard-go-too.html#storylink=cpy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idaho Statesman</a> first reported on the billboard and a regular commuter's response:&nbsp; “I don’t care if you’re Republican or Democrat, it was just beyond bad taste.”</p>
