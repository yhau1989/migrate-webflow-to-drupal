<p>The London Olympic opening ceremony was a grand spectacle. Directed by popular British director, Danny Boyle, the multi-hour extravaganza included more than one memorable concept:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a real-life pastoral scene</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Mr. Bean</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>giant rising smoke stacks</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>an Olympic flame transported down the Thames River, via speedboat, by soccer superstar David Beckham</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>extensive fireworks</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>a rousing journey through decades of British pop culture</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>dozens of Mary Poppins defeating a blow up Lord Voldemort</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Paul McCartney performance</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>symbolic lighting of the Olympic cauldron</li>
</ul>
<p>Most notable part of the ceremony for the politically-inclined was a rousing tribute to the National Health System, Britain's universal health care.</p>

<p>Radio jockey Rush Limbaugh had some harsh words for the ceremony today, as <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/79160.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Politico</a>, accusing it of being "socialist":</p>
<blockquote><em>“Of all the things of historical note in Great Britain, United Kingdom, the things they chose to highlight about themselves in that opening ceremony scared me more, because that’s a free people basically honoring socialism and collectivism. The [Chinese] people had no choice. They are under orders and under guns. In the U.K., a free people decided to do it.”</em></blockquote>
<div>Agence France Presse reported the reaction from Aiden Burly, a member of British Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party:</div>
<blockquote>
<div><em>"Aidan Burley, a lawmaker from Prime Minister David Cameron's ruling Conservative party, tweeted: "The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen -- more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state! Welfare tribute next?"</em></div></blockquote>
