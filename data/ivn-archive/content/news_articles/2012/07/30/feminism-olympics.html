<p>This is the year feminism gets a gold medal. For the first time Team USA is sending more women than men.</p>

<p>Every time the Olympics rolls around I can’t help but get a little excited. Ever since I was a kid, I’d sit in front of the TV and marvel at the amazing talent and skills demonstrated by people who seemed to defy the laws of physics — or at least have super-human powers. And it has always been a source of pride for me that one of my <a href="http://www.viewnews.com/2000/VIEW-Aug-30-Wed-2000/North/14232695.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">first stories</a> I wrote in Las Vegas was about local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasha_Schwikert" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympic gymnast Tasha Schwikert</a>.</p>

<p>With the 2012 Olympics in London upon us, its women and openly gay athletes who are taking center stage. This games marks the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/how-women-have-already-triumphed-at-the-2012-olympics/260301/#" rel="noopener noreferrer">first time in history</a> that all participating countries will have a woman representing them. Even tiny Brunei, which is only sending three athletes to these games, has a woman on their team. Likewise, there are <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/london-olympics-2012/2012/7/24/3169020/gay-lesbian-athletes-open-london" rel="noopener noreferrer">more openly gay athletes (21) at this Olympics</a> than at Athens (2004) or Beijing (2008). Interestingly, all but three of those athletes are lesbians.</p>

<p>And it’s not just about quantity over quality. The athlete who is making all the headlines as, perhaps, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/london-olympics-2012-missy-franklin-could-land-the-most-swimming-medals/2012/07/25/gJQAMpvb9W_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">top woman in the world</a> is 17-year-old American swimmer Missy Franklin, who is expected to match or beat Michael Phelps’ medal record in the pool.</p>

<p>Long story short: Women rule the 2012 Olympics!</p>

<p>This is all thanks, in no small part, to the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/story/2012-07-25/London-Olympics-Brennan-women/56488526/1" rel="noopener noreferrer">success of Title IX</a>, which celebrates 40 years just as these games are upon us. There would be no women’s soccer team (who have already chalked up a win!), if there had not first been Title IX, ensuring equal access, scholarships, and more.</p>

<p>So, the next time we see <a href="http://sincitysiren.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/blame-it-on-wages/" rel="noopener noreferrer">some national headlines</a> decrying the failures of feminism and women…remind them of this! 205 countries from all over the world — some of them known as hell-on-earth for women — and EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM has at least one woman on their team!</p>
