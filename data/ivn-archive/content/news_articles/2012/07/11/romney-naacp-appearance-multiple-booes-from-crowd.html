<p>After Mitt Romney said "I'm going to eliminate every non-essential program I can find," which included health care, he got a loud booooo from the crowd at the NAACP.  I give the Romney NAACP appearance credit for one thing.  The campaign showed up and delivered a speech.  And, he didn't tell them what he's got to know they would be more happy to hear.  That's a step in the right direction and a point in my book.</p>
