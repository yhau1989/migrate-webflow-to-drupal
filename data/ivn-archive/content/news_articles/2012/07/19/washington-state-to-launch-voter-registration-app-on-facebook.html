<p>The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/washington-facebook-voter-registration_n_1682366.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> reports that Washington State plans to launch an app next week which will allow Facbeook users to register to vote on the social media network. The application will be on the secretary of state's Facebook page and also give users the option of "liking" the application and recommending it to their friends.</p>
<blockquote><em>"In this age of social media and more people going online for services, this is a natural way to introduce people to online registration and leverage the power of friends on Facebook to get more people registered," said Shane Hamlin, co-director of elections.</em></blockquote>
<p>Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes&nbsp;also made a statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We are excited that citizens in Washington state will be able to register to vote and review useful voting information on Facebook."&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>The Facebook app will ask users to agree to let Facebook access their information, and while name and date of birth will be automatically filled out, the user will have to enter their state ID card or driver's license to continue.</p>

<p>Adding the aspect of social sharing to voter registration could really boost registration numbers, but would you feel comfortable giving Facebook your ID number?</p>
