<p>This election, an estimated <strong>five million eligible voters</strong> will be disenfranchised from the political process due to new voter identification laws. These de-facto voter suppression laws not only make it harder to register to vote, but also place restrictions on voting, creating an obstacle to eligible voters who lack government issued identification.</p>

<p>The Brennan Center for Justice released a <a href="http://brennan.3cdn.net/92635ddafbc09e8d88_i3m6bjdeh.pdf)" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a>&nbsp;in which they outlined the changes in voting laws we face in the 2012 election and the adverse affect on voter participation.</p>

<p>Here's how the Brennan Center for Justice arrived at the number 5 million:</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>: The number of states where new photo ID laws will be in effect (Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin)</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>: The number of states where new proof of citizenship laws will be in effect (Alabama, Kansas, Tennessee)</p>

<p><strong>240,000</strong>: The number of potential voters in Alabama that do not have documentary proof of citizenship</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>: The number of states that passed laws restricting voter registration drives, causing all or most of those drives to stop (Florida and Texas)</p>

<p><strong>176,000</strong>: The number of people who registered to vote via drives</p>

<p><strong>5.13</strong>: The percent of voters in Texas that registered via drives</p>

<p><strong>60,000</strong>: The number of Maine citizens who registered and voted on Election Day in 2008. Since Maine abolished Election Day registration, the number of potential voters adversely affected in 2012</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>: The number of states where the early voting period was cut by half or more (Florida, Georgia, and Ohio)</p>

<p><strong>8,000,000</strong>: The number of Americans who voted early in the above states</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>: The number of states that made it substantially more difficult or impossible for people with past felony convictions to get their voting rights restored (Florida and Iowa)</p>

<p><strong>1,000,000</strong>: The number of people in Florida who could have benefited from the prior practice</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>: The number of battleground states that have already cut back on voting rights (and may pass additional restrictive legislation)</p>

<p><strong>171</strong>: The number of electoral votes belonging to the state that have already cut back on voting rights</p>

<p><strong>270</strong>: The number of electoral votes needed to win the presidency</p>

<p><strong>63</strong>: The percent of the total number of electoral votes affected by restrictive voter laws</p>
