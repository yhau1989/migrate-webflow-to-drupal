<p>Back in 2008 California voters approved, by a narrow margin, to build the first high-speed train network in the United States. Last week, the plans moved ahead on the high speed rail when the California State Senate approved a critical funding bill. The “bullet” train is supposed to address growing transportation needs as well as create more jobs in California, where unemployment is currently <a href="http://www.bls.gov/lau/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10.8%</a>. However, these ideal outcomes come at an enormous price. The planning and building of the high-speed train network is estimated to cost nearly <a href="http://www.comstocksmag.com/Archive/0612_PL_Getting-on-the-Right-Track.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">$68 billion</a>. The state legislature has yet to approve the <a href="http://www.comstocksmag.com/Archive/0612_PL_Getting-on-the-Right-Track.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.7 billion</a> from the voter approved bond money. Once approved, if it is approved, the federal government can then contribute the promised <a href="http://www.comstocksmag.com/Archive/0612_PL_Getting-on-the-Right-Track.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.3 billion</a> funding, and building can begin.</p>

<p>Here are ten reasons why the <a href="http://www.cahighspeedrail.ca.gov/project_vision.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">California High Speed Rail Authority</a> believes the “bullet train” will prove to benefit majorly the state of California:</p>

<p>1. First and foremost, the high-speed rail will create more jobs. As many as <strong>100,000 construction related jobs</strong> each year that the system is being built as well as nearly <strong>450,000 permanent new jobs</strong> statewide created by the economic growth the train system will generate over the next 25 years.</p>

<p>2. Reduced dependence on foreign oil: <strong>12.7 million barrels less</strong> per year.</p>

<p>3. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: <strong>12 billion pounds less</strong> per year.</p>

<p>4. Improved air quality.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Faster travel</strong> on the ground between major metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>6. Congestion relief on freeways and at airports.</p>

<p>7. The trains system will cut air pollution and smog throughout California because the electric power to the trains can be produced by <strong>renewable sources</strong> like wind and solar.</p>

<p>8. 800 miles of track and up to 24 stations, meaning the railway will be <strong>highly accessible</strong>.</p>

<p>9. Cheaper, faster, and more convenient travel connected to local public transportation.</p>

<p>10. Enhanced public safety due to separation of tracks and existing roads and highways.</p>

<p>Do you think the California high-speed railway’s price tag matches the potential benefits?</p>
