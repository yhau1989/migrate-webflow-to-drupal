<p>The nation's governors will convene this weekend in As of today, Governor of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee is the lone Independent governor. He was a Republican Senator from 2000 to 2006. After his first full six-year term, he renounced his membership of the Republican Party and became Independent. In the 2010 gubernatorial race, he won and is the only Independent governor in America at the moment. Here are 10 facts about Governor Chafee that highlight his work as a politician:</p>

Schilling places the blame on Chafee for denying a $5 million tax credit. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120711/us-schilling-s-gaming-company-chafee/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The company claims the denial scared investors away from the company.</a></p>

<p>- As a Republican Senator, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/opinion/01chafee.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chafee voted against George W. Bush's authorization for the invasion of Iraq in 2002</a>.</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=06-P13-00014&amp;segmentID=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chafee was a member of Republicans for Environmental Protection</a>, now known as ConservAmerica.</p>

<p>Governor Chafee is facing <a href="http://630wpro.com/Article.asp?id=2403472&amp;spid=40092" rel="noopener noreferrer">low approval ratings</a> and a state with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. He will travel to the National Governors Association's annual meeting to be held this weekend. At this time of high polarization in the political spectrum, perhaps voters will look to Independent politicians for leadership positions when election time comes.</p>
