<p>There has not been much in the way of coverage of recent protests across Mexico against their latest election results. The July 1 election saw PRI candidate Enrique Pena Nieto grab the presidency. His party is well known for its 70 year rule of the country riddled with corruption and repression.</p>

<p>Stories have circulated that the party was bribing citizens to get their votes with cash or gift cards in the days leading to the election. The protestors allege that the vote buying is responsible for the 7% win for the party. Any vote buying would stand in direct opposition to a prior movement for clean and open elections.&nbsp;The Mexico protests have pushed a rival candidate closer to Nieto in recent polls as the third place candidate drops lower.</p>

<p>Student organizations and open government advocates have been protesting in at least 17 cities across the country, including protests in weeks prior to the July 1 election. The Mexico protests also include allegations that media outlets are refusing to cover the story because they heavily favor the PRI.</p>

<p>Next steps for the protestors and eventual outcomes still seem unclear considering the lack of coverage. My first guess is that results would stand but the noise may continue to grow if tens of thousands are still protesting 12 days after the election without any coverage.</p>
