<p>The California park system secretly hid $54 million as it cut services and begged for money from private donors, which is certainly some kind of new low in bottom-dwelling,&nbsp;cynical, manipulative, politics.</p>
<blockquote>The announcement means the department has plenty of cash, even though it's&nbsp;<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/07/california-parks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">been soliciting hundreds of thousands</a>&nbsp;of dollars in donations in what was thought to be a desperate scramble to keep parks open.</blockquote>
<p>The two maggots at the top of the agency have either quit or been fired.</p>

<p>The finances of the agency need a complete investigation from an independent auditor. How could they hide so much money and is all the money accounted for?</p>
