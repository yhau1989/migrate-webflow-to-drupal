<p>New York City's Mayor Mike Bloomberg came out swinging today in the aftermath of the horrific movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado. He pressed the presidential candidates to go beyond the typical political response to the situation and propose solutions. Mayor Bloomberg is a vocal proponent for tougher gun control laws.</p>

<p>“You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,” Bloomberg said in the radio interview.</p>
