<p>Independents overwhelmingly find this year's presidential election "annoying" and "dull", according to a new poll by Pew Research Center. In fact, majorities across the board for partisans and non-partisans show a chilly response to the present presidential campaign cycle. The number of respondents finding the election "dull" increased in June, too. Many find the campaigns too long, albeit important.</p>

<p>What are your opinions on the presidential race? Do you find these results are accurate to your point of view?</p>
