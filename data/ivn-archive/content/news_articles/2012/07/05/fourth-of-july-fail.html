<p>The Port of San Diego's&nbsp;"Big Bay Boom" firework spectacular made national headlines when the Port accidentally set off their&nbsp;entire stockpile of pyrotechnic firepower in one explosion, turning what was expected to be 30 minutes show into a 15 second explosion. What's worse, it erupted five minutes before the show was scheduled to start, leaving San Diegans&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;and confused.&nbsp;The Port released an official <a href="http://www.bigbayboom.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> blaming a 'technical problem" for the 15 second execution.</p>

<p>According to one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guj_r-9X7jw&amp;feature=related" rel="noopener noreferrer">spectator</a>,&nbsp;"it looked like a planet coming." What do you think?</p>
