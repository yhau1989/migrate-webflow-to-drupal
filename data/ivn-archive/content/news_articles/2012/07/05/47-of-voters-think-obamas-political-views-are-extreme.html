<blockquote>A bare majority of voters still considers Mitt Romney in the political mainstream, while the number who think President Obamaâ€™s views are extreme has edged up for the second month in a row.&nbsp; A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 51% of Likely U.S. Voters describe the political views of the presumptive Republican presidential candidate as mainstream. Thirty-one percent (31%) consider his views extreme. Eighteen percent (18%) are not sure. (To see survey question wording,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/questions/pt_survey_questions/june_2012/questions_obama_romney_mainstream_extreme_june_29_30_2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>.)</blockquote>
<p>While I didn't vote for either Obama or McCain last election, I have been&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;by how "mainstream" Obama has actually been. &nbsp;Even the health care plan, lest Republicans forget, contained many provisions that originated out of the Republican Party, like the individual mandate they now hate so much. &nbsp;This provision was necessary because Obama broke ranks with the more liberal side of the Democratic caucus; remember the demands for "single-payer" health care?</p>

<p>On a final point of pontification, Obama has had to deal with the most divisive and partisan congress in the history of the country. &nbsp;Every issue is boiled down to campaign talking points. &nbsp;Every idea is branded as an "us v. them." &nbsp;So it should not be a surprise when the American people view anyone in the political thicket as an extremist from their respective side. &nbsp;It is no wonder that Obama's political views are viewed the same.</p>
