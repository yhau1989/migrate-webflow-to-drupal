<p>Over the weekend, we posted this picture of House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama on our&nbsp;<a href="www.facebook.com/independnetvoternetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, and asked our followers to add their own caption.&nbsp;The original AP caption for this photo was: "These guys don't trust each other," but I think it's safe to say that our Facebook audience was a little more creative than that.</p>
