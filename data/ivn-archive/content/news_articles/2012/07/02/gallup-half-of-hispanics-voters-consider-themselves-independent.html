<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Hispanics-Independent-Voters.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="328" src="cloudinary://Hispanics-Independent-Voters.jpg" title="Hispanics Independent Voters" width="598"></a>Gallup released a survey today which indicates that half of hispanic voters considers themselves independent. &nbsp;At a time when Republicans and Democrats are increasingly targeting this growing and large portion of the electorate, these numbers are not welcome news to the parties.</p>

<p>Another notable figure is that while 32% of hispanics consider themselves Democrats, just 11% say the same about being a Republican. &nbsp;Further, when it came down to election time, twice as many hispanics that identified themselves as independents were "democratic leaners" when it came to voting between the two.</p>

<p>Gallup has attributed much of this independent streak to the fact that hispanics are not fully integrated into the political process in the United States. &nbsp;What is your take?</p>
