<p>A poll by the <a href="http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/8329.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> released today shows Republicans are slightly more motivated to turn out to vote in upcoming November elections given the Supreme Court's ruling on health care reform. The majority of voters from every party affiliation report say the decision won't impact whether they turn out in November. The poll found 56% of Americans prefer lawmakers stop efforts to block the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and address other national issues.</p>
