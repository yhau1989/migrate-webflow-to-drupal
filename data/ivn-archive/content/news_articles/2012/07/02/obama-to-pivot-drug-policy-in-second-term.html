<p>In a <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/07/exclusive-in-his-second-term-obama-will-pivot-to-the-drug-war.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GQ</em> article</a> today, and expanded upon on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/obama-drug-war_n_1643483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a>, the possibility of President Obama altering his administration's drug policy if he wins a second term is examined.</p>

<p>According to <em>GQ</em> sources, "<a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/07/exclusive-in-his-second-term-obama-will-pivot-to-the-drug-war.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama aides and associates</a>", the President intends on tackling the Drug War in his second term.</p>

<p>But, as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/obama-drug-war_n_1643483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPo reports</a>, a former Obama drug policy adviser cautions against over-optimism:</p>
<blockquote><em>"...if legalization advocates are waiting for the President's 'marijuana moment,' my guess is that day will never come. The scientific consensus is that legalization would increase use, especially among kids, and I think that is not something the President wants to happen under his watch."</em></blockquote>
