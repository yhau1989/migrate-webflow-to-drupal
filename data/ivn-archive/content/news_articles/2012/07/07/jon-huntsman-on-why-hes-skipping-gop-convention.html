<blockquote><em>"I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future, until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United Statesâ€”a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits."</em> -former Republican presidential candidate, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/linda-mcmahon-other-republicans-plan-skip-gop-convention-150147281.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Huntsman</a>.
