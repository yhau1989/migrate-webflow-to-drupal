<p>This week is expected to give way to a lengthy discussion on the impending defense budget cuts via sequestration, as part of the federal budget deficit negotiations of 2011. The threat of automatic cuts will be considered closely this week in a number of events in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>The Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 and the 2013 defense appropriations bill will both reach the floor of the House later this week.</p>

<p>What do you think will happen? Will Congress reach a new agreement to avoid the automatic cuts? How?</p>
