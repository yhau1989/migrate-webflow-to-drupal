<p>San Diego, California came out on top in the updated Tolerance Index, scoring higher than other diverse metros like Napa, CA, Ithaca, NY, Miami, FL, and Las Vegas, NV.</p>

<p>The key variables included the share of immigrants or foreign-born residents, the Gay Index (the concentration of gays and lesbians), and the Integration Index, which tracks the level of segregation between ethnic and racial groups.</p>

<p>In an article published by <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/07/geography-tolerance/2241/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a>, author Richard Florida explains,</p>
<blockquote><em>Tolerance—the third of my 3Ts of economic development—provides a critical source of economic advantage that works alongside Technology and Talent. Places that are open to new ideas attract creative people from around the globe, broadening both their technology and talent capabilities, gaining a substantial economic edge.</em></blockquote>
