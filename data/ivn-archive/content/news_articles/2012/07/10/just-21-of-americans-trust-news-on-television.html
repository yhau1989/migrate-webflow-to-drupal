<p><img alt="" height="304" src="cloudinary://fyncndiaa0y_cmcxabwz8w.gif" title="Trust in News" width="559">When Gallup began tracking how many Americans trust news television in 1996, 46% of Americans had confidence in news networks to provide good and accurate information. &nbsp;Today, just 16 years later, less than half of that number now have confidence in television news.</p>

<p>The drop in confidence in our 'news' is because our media leaders, like our political leaders, continue to boil everything down to a left v. right mentality. &nbsp;Every issue and every story is delivered as if there is a "Democrat" side and a "Republican" side, feeding into the political emotions that drive many people to tune in. &nbsp;The Sean Hannity and Ed Schultz of the world are not 'news' reporters. &nbsp;They simply pander to their respective extremes, claiming virtue for their side, calling the other side evil, and pretending there are no other opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>It is lazy and self-righteous reporting. &nbsp;They feed their base of viewers with what they "want to hear," (aka, what their viewers already agree with). &nbsp;In return, they get a loyal following that pats them on the back and think their gospel is truth. &nbsp;The idea of the news being something the people "need to hear" has flown out the window with Congressional compromises and real debate.</p>

<p>The days of finding issues that go beyond creating divisions and decisiveness have slowed. &nbsp;As a result, people who think for themselves have stopped trusting the 'news'. &nbsp;No wonder the same radicals that control the political dialogue are the ones left tuning in.</p>
