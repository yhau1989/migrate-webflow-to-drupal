<blockquote><em>Leahy's been a lifelong Batman fan. He <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/washington/12leahy.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">told </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/washington/12leahy.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> in 2008 that Batman is awesome because he "has no super powers... He had to use his own brains and his own knowledge. He could have had an entirely different life. As a billionaire, he could have done anything."</em></blockquote>
