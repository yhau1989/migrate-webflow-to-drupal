<p>Key swing states have seen a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-10/independent-voter-surge-cuts-democrats-swing-state-edge.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">surge</a> in independent voters, with Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and North Carolina adding a collective 443,000 independents to their voter demographic. And while the number of voters registering as Republicans steadily increases, Democrats have seen a decline in the number of voters registering with their party.</p>

<p>Why?&nbsp;<strong>Voters are frustrated.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>“Independents are really just fed up with both parties. Most elections are about the center and that’s where the swing vote is going to come from.” - Michelle Diggles, senior policy analyst with the Democratic-leaning Third Way research group in Washington.&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>When surveyed, independent voters found both the Republican and Democratic Parties as unfavorable. An independent voter from New Hampshire explained,</p>
<blockquote><em>“I just want to be able to have the freedom to pick the right person to do the right things for the country.”</em></blockquote>
<p>What's your reason for registering independent?</p>
