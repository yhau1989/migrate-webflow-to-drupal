<p>Colorado is leading the way concerning several policies, and may eventually be a good model for other states for how to take divisive issues and hold positive and creative dialogue among the stakeholders (constituents). At least that is what I think thus far in our journey around the state. Colorado, in general, has a diverse mix of voters (713,506 Democrats; 829,259 Republicans; 668,182 Independents), which makes Colorado a swing State– a testing ground for ideas, and a stomping ground for independent thinking.</p>

<p>The most talked about ballot initiative at this point, is the <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Colorado_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_%282012%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Colorado_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_%282012%29">Colorado Marijuana Legalization Initiative</a>, which would legalize marijuana in the state. For anyone who is a supporter of food and health freedom, this is a major step towards getting the federal government out of the drug business and the drug war. For staunch constitutionalists like myself, who do not think the federal government has any right to tell a Colorado citizen what they can or can’t do with their body– this is a nice and refreshing initiative that softly reminds them of that.</p>

<p>Potential <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Colorado_2012_ballot_measures" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Colorado_2012_ballot_measures">citizen initiatives from Colorado</a> include, but are not limited to:</p>
<blockquote>- Colorado Handgun Concealment Amendment (Would allow concealed carry of handguns without permits)

- Colorado Property Tax Elimination Amendment (Would eliminate property taxes in the state)

- “Right to Foreclosure” Amendment (Require lenders to prove their right to foreclose on property)

- Court Term Limit Measure (Would limit the seven Supreme Court judges to two-year terms)</blockquote>
[social_blockquote quote="Agreeing that Coloradans are better suited to make these decisions is a big step for states’ rights." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=26857" handle="" hashes=""]Driving around Colorado, it is easy to feel the attitude of change, of wanting to participate, and of absolute frustration with the economy and the political mudslinging that doesn’t solve any of our problems. Some solutions are best left to states. Colorado is one that recognizes this, and although we will not agree on all of the issues, we do agree that making these decisions here in Colorado for Coloradans, makes much more sense than having bureaucrats in Washington, DC decide what we do with our food and health freedom, right to bear arms, taxpayer money, property, and elected officials who are charged with administering law. And agreeing that Coloradans are better suited to make these decisions is a big step for states’ rights.&nbsp; And this notion is absolutely critical for the ability of Coloradans to have conversations with other Colorado citizens. This is where we find real solutions and not the political rhetoric that has corrupted our nation’s capital.
