<p>1. Acting in movies with a chimpanzee named Bonzo didn’t hurt Reagan’s chances of becoming President of the United States.</p>

<p>2. In 1940, Reagan was voted “Most Nearly Perfect Male Figure” by the University of California. In honor of receiving this recognition, he was given the opportunity to pose, almost naked, for art students attempting to sculpt the human physique.</p>

<p>3. Ronald Reagan was the oldest president in American history and was famous for dozing off in meetings. He was quoted saying before the end of his second term, “As soon as I get home to California, I plan to lean back, kick up my feet, and take a long nap. Come to think of it, things won’t be that different after all.”</p>
