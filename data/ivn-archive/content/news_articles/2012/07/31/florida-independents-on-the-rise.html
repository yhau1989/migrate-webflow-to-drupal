<p>The number of voters in Florida registering as independent is drastically rising, reports the <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/florida-voter-registrations-a-rising-tide-of-indep/nP57K/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palm Beach Post</a>, as the two charts above reveal. Since 1972, Florida independent voters rose 20 percent and independent voters now account for 23.8 percent of the stateside voting electorate. That translates into 2.7 million independent voters today.</p>

<p><strong>Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><em>“People are seeing this polarization and they are not happy with it.”</em> -&nbsp;Dukhong&nbsp;Kim, Assistant Professor of Political Science at FAU</p>

<p><em>“The political parties have too much power.”</em>-&nbsp;Everett Wilkinson, Chairman and Founder of the South Florida Tea Party</p>
