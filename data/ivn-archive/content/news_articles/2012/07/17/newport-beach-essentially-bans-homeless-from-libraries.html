<p>The City Council in Newport Beach, California has passed a slew of new regulations for using the city's four library branches. They are designed to cut down on noisy, and sometimes smelly, patrons. Essentially--the homeless. <a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2012/07/12/napping-swearing-foul-odors-banned-at-newport-beach-libraries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">KNX 1070 Newsradio</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><em>Among the newly-banned activities on library premises: sitting, sleeping or otherwise occupying furniture in a manner that suggests lounging.</em>

<em>Under the new policy, patrons can also be asked to leave if they are not wearing shoes, use threatening or abusive language toward library staff, or even for a lack of personal hygiene or “use of perfume or fragrance which produces odors that interfere with other patrons’ use of library facilities or staff members’ ability to perform duties”.</em></blockquote>
<p>While the city contends the new rules are not to unfairly target the homeless population, sleeping bags, blankets and shopping carts are now also banned.</p>

<p>What do you think about the new rules?</p>
