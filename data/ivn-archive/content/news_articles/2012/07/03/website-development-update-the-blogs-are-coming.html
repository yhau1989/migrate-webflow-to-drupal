<p>A major feature that is nearing completion are the individual blogs. &nbsp;These blogs will serve as a homebase for contributors and editors to post information that matters to you most. &nbsp;But, unlike similar news sites, the blog administrators at IVN will be given broad latitude to add authors, editors, pages, and even custom widgets to their sidebar. &nbsp;And blog posts that are of a newsworthy quality can be promoted to the IVN.us homepage, sending them into the news feed.</p>

<p>As we complete testing, we will be offering the first blogs to contributors that have been with us the longest. &nbsp;Eventually, these blogs will be open to the larger community of writers.</p>
