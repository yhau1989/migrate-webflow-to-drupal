<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.makanipower.com/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makani Airborne Wind Turbine</a> is a tethered wing that generates power by flying in large circles where the wind is stronger and more consistent. It eliminates 90% of the material used in conventional wind turbines, and can access winds both at higher altitudes and above deep waters offshore â€” resources that are currently untapped. Our goal is the utility-scale deployment of airborne turbines in offshore wind farms.
