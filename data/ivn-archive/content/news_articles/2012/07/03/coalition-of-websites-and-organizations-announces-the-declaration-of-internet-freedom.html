<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120701/22394419546/announcing-declaration-internet-freedom.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechDirt.com</a> reported Monday:</p>
<blockquote>"A whole bunch of organizations and individuals are getting together today to launch the beginning of a process, the creation of an Internet Declaration of Freedom. We've seen how the internet has been under attack from various directions, and we recognize that it's time to make that stop. The internet is an incredible platform that we want to grow and to thrive, and thus, a very large coalition got together to produce the following document as a starting point, hoping to kick off a much larger discussion which <strong>we hope you'll join in</strong>."</blockquote>
<p>The preamble to the <a href="http://www.internetdeclaration.org/freedom" rel="noopener noreferrer">Declaration of Internet Freedom</a> says:</p>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>"We believe that a free and open Internet can bring about a better world. To keep the Internet free and open, we call on communities, industries and countries to recognize these principles. We believe that they will help to bring about more creativity, more innovation and more open societies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<div>We are joining an international movement to defend our freedoms because we believe that they are worth fighting for.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let’s discuss these principles — agree or disagree with them, debate them, translate them, make them your own and broaden the discussion with your community — as only the Internet can make possible.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Join us in keeping the Internet free and open."</div></blockquote>

<p>Here's a text version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Declaration of Internet Freedom</strong></p>
We stand for a free and open Internet.

We support transparent and participatory processes for making Internet policy and the establishment of five basic principles:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Expression:</strong> Don't censor the Internet.</li>
	<li><strong>Access:</strong> Promote universal access to fast and affordable networks.</li>
	<li><strong>Openness:</strong> Keep the Internet an open network where everyone is free to connect, communicate, write, read, watch, speak, listen, learn, create and innovate.</li>
	<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Protect the freedom to innovate and create without permission. Don’t block new technologies, and don’t punish innovators for their users' actions.</li>
	<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Protect privacy and defend everyone’s ability to control how their data and devices are used.</li>
</ul>
