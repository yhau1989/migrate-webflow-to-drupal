<h3>Data Visualization:</h3>
<p>There are so many ways to get what you have discovered out there for the world to see. One of the better more user friendly data visualization methods &nbsp;I have been steadily learning is Google Maps. &nbsp;It has been a challenge throughout. Google does provide, however, a very user friendly tool for geospatial and demographic data visualization called <a href="http://support.google.com/fusiontables/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2571232" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Fusion tables</a>. This tool allows for easy upload of data in spreadsheet format and will visualize it in a Google Map. The data, of course, must have a location associated with each record.</p>

<p>Say you would like to show the voter turnout percentages from the last Primary election for your Stateâ€™s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_congressional_districts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressional districts</a>.</p>

<p>The data visualization process for this projects criteria would be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Find and collect the data (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" rel="noopener noreferrer">shapefile</a> of district boundaries, election stats from <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secretary of State</a>)</li>
	<li>Format the data into a useable layout</li>
	<li>Merge the data together based on a common field</li>
	<li>Import into your Gmail docs account as a Fusion Table (for this project)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fusion Table web app is intuitive and will recognize any spatial data as location (geographic coordinates, etc.). From there you can style your map with a user interface of design tool menus and click embed to get an embed code for your website or copy and paste the code into a .txt (notepad) and save as html to show your audience. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> for some examples how Google Fusion Tables can help you with your data visualization.</p>
