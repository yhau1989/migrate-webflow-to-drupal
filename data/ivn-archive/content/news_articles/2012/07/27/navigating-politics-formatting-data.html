<h3>Data&nbsp;Formatting:</h3>
<p>Once you have found the data that you are looking for, downloading from a compatible source for the data formatting and analysis being performed can be challenging. This will save you a lot of trouble. Yes PDFs are convenient, but a raw file format like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel" rel="noopener noreferrer">.xls (MS excel)</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" rel="noopener noreferrer">.csv (comma separated values)</a> will save you a lot of trouble when trying to sort statistics and generating presentations during the data formatting process.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shapefile (.shp)</a> format for cartographic design are great sources for already formatted datasets. Each shapefile consists of five base files, one of which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase" rel="noopener noreferrer">database (.dbf)</a> file. You can download any shapefile, open it up, to reveal a list of files. The .dbf will run in any database application like Microsoft Excel or Access. Having a .dbf file makes the method by which you complete your data formatting and how long you need to spend arranging cells into columns and rows go quicker.</p>

Probably the most tedious task once you have the information is data formatting the records of information for&nbsp;analytic&nbsp;use. If the records in your data table are circularly referenced, a few hours of reconstituting the original method of organization is in order. Each attribute of every data record should be in its own attribute column. For example, sorting a column in a spreadsheet that contains both a candidate’s name and party affiliation can lead to troubles; there should be an attribute column each for [first_name], [last_name], and another for [party].

<p>For larger datasets, learning a little bit of query and selection language (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_basic" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Basic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a>) would be beneficial. Hiring a data formatting professional temporarily that already knows MS sql is well worth it for reformatting or creating subsets of information from the original larger dataset.</p>

<p><strong>One last thing on this note:</strong></p>

<p>Often you have multiple sets of data and need them all together. The best way to merge datasets is based on a common field using a databasing tool application like Microsoft SQL Studio. Each set of data should have a common attribute like “name” that you can use to append one set to the other.</p>
