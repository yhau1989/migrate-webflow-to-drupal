<p>President Obama is <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/obama-to-call-for-partial-extension-of-bush-era-tax-cuts-20120709" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected to announce</a> today at 11:50am EST, an initiative for a one year expansion of the Bush Tax cuts to families making less than $250,000 a year. The dynamic between the President, Democratic leadership and Republican opponents is one to watch this month as momentum builds towards a vote on taxes. Without action, the Bush Tax cuts will expire in their entirety on January 1st.</p>
