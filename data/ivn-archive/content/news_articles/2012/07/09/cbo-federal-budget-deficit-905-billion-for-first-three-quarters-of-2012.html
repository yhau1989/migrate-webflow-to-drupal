<p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the US Treasury ran almost a $1 trillion dollar federal budget deficit for the first nine months of 2012. &nbsp;While this is less than the deficit ran at this time last year, there is sure to be increasing scrutiny of over-spending as the Presidential race continues to heat up.</p>

<blockquote>CBO estimates in its latest&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43419" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monthly Budget Review</a></em>&nbsp;that the Treasury Department will report a deficit of $905 billion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, $66 billion less than the $971 billion deficit incurred through June 2011. Outlays are about 1 percent higher and revenues are about 5 percent higher than they were at the same point last year.
