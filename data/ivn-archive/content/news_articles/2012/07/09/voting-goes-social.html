<p>Facebook will also partner with CNN to gauge real-time opinion of voters.</p>
<blockquote><em>“By allowing citizens to connect in an authentic and meaningful way with presidential candidates and discuss critical issues facing the country, we hope more voters than ever will get involved with issues that matter most to them,” Joe Lockhart, Facebook’s vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement. “Facebook is pleased to partner with CNN on this uniquely participatory experience.”</em></blockquote>
