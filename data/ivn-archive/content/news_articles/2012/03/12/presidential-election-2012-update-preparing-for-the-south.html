<p>With the Kansas and Wyoming caucuses behind them, the Republican presidential hopefuls look towards tomorrow's primaries in&nbsp;Alabama, Mississippi, and Hawaii for delegates, offering 101 collectively. Picking up 33 of the state's 40 delegates, Rick Santorum received 51% support in Kansas this weekend, while Mitt Romney picked up seven of the 12 delegates at stake in Wyoming. Romney's performance in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands added 22 delegates to his count, but it was Ron Paul who decisively won in the Virgin Islands, winning almost 30% of the popular vote.</p>
