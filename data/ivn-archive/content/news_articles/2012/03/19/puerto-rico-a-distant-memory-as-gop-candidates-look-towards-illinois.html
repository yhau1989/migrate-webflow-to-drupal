<p>With the Puerto Rico primary behind them, GOP candidates embark on a final <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/19/politics/campaign-wrap/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign blitz</a> across the state of Illinois. With Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum making their final attempts at appealing to the Land of Lincoln voters, both argue that a victory in the state could seal the GOP nomination. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul continue on in the race with no signs of backing down.&nbsp;And while Paul is still without a win, his campaign continues to&nbsp;vie&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/politics/article/248122/23/Rep-Ron-Pauls-Campaign-Aims-to-Collect-Stray-Delegates" rel="noopener noreferrer">stray delegates</a>&nbsp;in states that have already held caucuses and is speculated to have at least 50 delegates so far.</p>

Gingrich's campaign manager stated, "<em>I think if he had been in Puerto Rico, the race would have been a lot closer,</em>" because of his early support for Puerto Rican statehood. Gingrich instead spend his time campaigning in the delegate rich&nbsp;Illinois&nbsp;and Louisiana.</p>

Among those voting for Romney on Sunday was Puerto Rico's Governor, Luis Fortuno, who <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116796/Rick-Santorum-calls-Puerto-Rico-Spanish-speaking-COUNTRY-day-primary.html?ito=feeds-newsxml" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Associated Press</a>, "<em>He has a stronger connection to Puerto Rico and that will help us in the process of becoming a state."</em> Looking forward to Tuesday, Romney has polled in first place, with 45% of the likely GOP vote, according to most recent <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_IL_318.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Policy Polling numbers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/7-Rick-Santorum.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="90" src="cloudinary://7-Rick-Santorum.png" width="90"></a></strong><strong>Rick Santorum (Republican): </strong>Rick Santorum struggled to compete with Romney on Sunday in the Puerto Rican primary, partly due to his two major gaffes on the subject of language.&nbsp;Last week he was <a href="http://gantdaily.com/2012/03/19/romney-sweeps-puerto-rico-while-debate-continues-on-english-only/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>“Everyone should speak English here. That’s something that I think is essential to be an American, period. Whether you’re going to be a state or not, people should speak English.”</em></blockquote>
<p>Then on Sunday, the day of the vote, Santorum referred to the territory as a "Spanish-speaking country," ignoring the fact that English and Spanish are both official languages of Puerto Rico. His chances at making a comeback in Illinois are slim, according to the latest poll, which places <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/03/mitt-romney-illinois-poll-rick-santorum-/1#.T2df12JWrEU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney 15 percentage points ahead of Santorum</a> among likely GOP primary voters.</p>
