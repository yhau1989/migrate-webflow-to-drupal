<p>Gerrymandering is outlawed. It will be replaced by any combination of compact <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=computer+drawn+districts+" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer drawn districts</a> using open source software and/or citizen wisdom councils selected from jury duty pools, and/or at-large districts. All gerrymanders in progress in 2011 are stopped by this Act and replaced by tightly-drawn districts. In light of the 1:1 representation provided by national referendums, no increase in the number of Representatives is necessary.</p>

<p>Gerrymandering is criminal insane and totally against the intent of the representational aspect of democracy.&nbsp; As one wag has put it, gerrymandering allows the Members of the House to choose their voters, rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>I confess to having been an inattentive citizen all these years--voting in every election but completely oblivious to the criminal neglect of the public interest by the two-party tyranny and the Congress (both the Senate and the House).</p>

<p>This initiative is part of a whole -- without all the others, especially National Ballot Initiatives that give every citizen a say on major proposed spending, and also campaign finance and ballot access, fixing this by itself does very little.&nbsp; That is the key point: we have to fix the whole thing all at once to create sustainable integrity.</p>
