<p>Today marks the second day the Supreme Court of the United States is hearing oral arguments on the constitutionality of ObamaCare’s mandate that all individuals must have health insurance.&nbsp;Congress adopted the individual mandate and justified its constitutionality by relying on the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>Here’s their argument: <em>Because the uninsured use health care, they have an impact on commerce, thus Congress has enumerated powers to regulate it outlined in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal’s David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304636404577291883293776326.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet_bot" rel="noopener noreferrer">write</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Congress’s reliance on the Commerce Clause to support the individual mandate was politically expedient but constitutionally deficient. Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce is broad but not limitless.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>What do you think? Does health care count as commerce? Does Congress have the constitutional power to regulate it?</span></p>
