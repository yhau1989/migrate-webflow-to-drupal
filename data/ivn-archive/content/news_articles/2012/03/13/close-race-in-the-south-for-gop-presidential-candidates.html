<p>Today the GOP Presidential Candidates head to the South for a pair of highly contested primaries in Alabama and Mississippi. In what has become an increasingly close race, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are competing for the Conservative vote, while Mitt Romney looks to the Deep South as a chance at sealing front-runner status. After his <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/13/media-misleads-as-ron-paul-gets-his-first-win-in-virgin-islands/" rel="noopener noreferrer">first victory in the Virgin Islands</a>, Ron Paul has refrained from actively campaigning in the states.</p>

A win in either one or both of the two states is crucial to the Gingrich campaign. Gingrich’s initial <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/13/gingrich-takes-his-stand-in-dixieland/" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> in the south was to string together victories in the six delegate rich core states, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.</p>

He stated that to make America more competitive in the global economy, "the key is to make sure the playing field is level."
