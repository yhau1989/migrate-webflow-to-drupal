<p>Al Gore likes to talk about the internet and is conversant with its language.

<p>3. “How could [Y2K] be a problem in a country where we have Intel and Microsoft?” (Jan. 1999)</p>
<p>4. “Our democracy, our constitutional framework is really a kind of software for harnessing the creativity and political imagination for all of our people. The American democratic system was an early political version of Napster.” (Sept. 2000)</p>
<p>5. “Remember America, I gave you the Internet and I can take it away.” (Sept. 2000, 9th item on the “Top 10 List of Rejected Gore-Lieberman Campaign Slogans” list on “The Late Show with David Letterman”)</p>
