<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO – As the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments this week concerning the constitutionality of “ObamaCare,” Assembly Health Committee Vice-Chair Dan Logue (R-Marysville) today introduced legislation that would urge the federal government to repeal ObamaCare and instead create a fiscally-sustainable and consumer-directed system.</p>

<p>“Americans are anxiously waiting to see if the Supreme Court will strike down President Obama’s job-killing healthcare law enacted two years ago,” said Logue. “But regardless of the outcome, it is not too late for the federal government to see the writing on the wall that ObamaCare will bankrupt our country and curtail our freedom. That is why I have authored legislation urging Washington, D.C. to re-do health care reform in a way that protects individual liberty and promotes choice.”</p>

<p>Logue’s Assembly Joint Resolution calls on the President and Congress to repeal the 2,700 page law creating ObamaCare because it is incompatible with the U.S. Constitution’s fundamental principles of limited government and respect for individual liberty. The resolution lists more than 100 reasons why ObamaCare should be repealed. Assemblyman Logue also calls for the creation of a fiscally-sustainable and consumer-directed health care system that fulfills every American’s need for affordable health care.</p>

<p>“This resolution sends a strong message to leaders in Washington, D.C. and here in Sacramento,” said Logue. “The government has been rushing to implement this terrible law, despite all the problems it will create. It is time to stop and reconsider the consequences of the President’s so called health care reform.”</p>

<p>The resolution, which has 12 coauthors, will be heard before the Assembly Rules Committee in the coming weeks. It would require the approval of the full Assembly and Senate, but not the Governor, in order to be formally adopted.</p>

<p>Assemblyman Logue represents the 3rd Assembly District in the California Legislature, which includes the communities of Butte, Lassen, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sierra and Yuba.</p>
