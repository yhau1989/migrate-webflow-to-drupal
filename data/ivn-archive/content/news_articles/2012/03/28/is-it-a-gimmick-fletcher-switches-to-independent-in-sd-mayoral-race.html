<p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/nathan-fletcher/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher</a> announced today that he is dropping his Republican party preference and running as an independent for Mayor in San Diego.</p>

<p>The late decision will test his credibility with <a href="http://ivn.us/independent-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent voters</a>. Fletcher despite heaving funding from the city's Republican establishment and seen as one of the party's stars, was running well behind in the polls.</p>

<p>California Republicans had endorsed San Diego City Councilmember Carl DeMaio, who also leads in campaign funds.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/2012/01/26/poll-shows-how-independents-will-fare-in-open-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polling</a> and focus groups have suggested that independent voters put a premium on authenticity. Is Fletcher's switch an honest change of heart or a cynical campaign gimmick? His viability likely hinges on what these <a href="http://ivn.us/news/2012/02/06/independents-on-the-rise-in-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical swing voters</a> will believe.</p>
