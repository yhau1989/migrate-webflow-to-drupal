<p><span>‎”What we have today is a far cry from what the Founders intended. George Washington and James Madison both warned of the dangers posed by political parties…The problem is not division but partisanship—advantage-seeking</span><span></span><span>&nbsp;by private clubs whose central goal is to win political power.” - Former Congressman Mickey Edwards</span></p>
