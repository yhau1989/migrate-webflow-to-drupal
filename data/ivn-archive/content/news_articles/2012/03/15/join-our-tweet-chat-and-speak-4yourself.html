<p><strong>UPDATE: IVN Tweet Chat is TODAY March 15th, 2012 at 11am PST (2pm EST). Hope to see you there!</strong></p>

<p>The Independent Voter Network is hosting a tweet chat today, at 11am PST (2pm EST) - 12pm PST (3pm EST) and we want your input! We'll be discussing the misrepresentation of independent voters, dissatisfaction with the two-party system, and asking independent candidates and voters for their opinion on the 2012 election. Here's what you need to know about what to expect, how to participate, and why you should join in.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/twitter-featured1.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="270" src="cloudinary://twitter-featured1.jpeg" width="570"></a><strong>What's a tweet chat?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A tweet chat is an online conversation surrounding a specific topic. This pre-arranged chat takes place on Twitter and usually has a moderator and a hashtag. In our case, we will be moderating the event and we have chosen the hashtag <strong>#4yourself</strong> (as in speak for yourself).&nbsp;We have prepared a series of questions that we will ask over the course of the hour. Remember, because it's on Twitter, all responses must be 140 characters or less, but feel free to send multiple tweets. We want to hear anything and everything you have to say!</p>

<p><strong>How do you participate?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/IVNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">@IVNetwork</a>. From there, you have two options on how to participate:</p>

<p><strong>(1) TweetChat:</strong> I would recommend using the client <a href="http://tweetchat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TweetChat</a>, which allows you securely log-in, enter a hashtag to follow, and then converse in real-time with other independent voters just like you. We have chosen the hashtag <strong>#4yourself</strong>, and if you are using TweetChat, each tweet will automatically get the hashtag #4yourself added to it. TweetChat also allows you to pause the chat, making it easier for you to respond to individuals or us.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Twitter: </strong>Sound complicated?&nbsp;You can also just sign in to your Twitter account and enter in the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%234yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4yourself</a> in the search bar at the top right. This will let you follow the conversation without signing into a third party service like TweetChat, but it might have a delay. When you see a question or response you want to "tweet" about, just compose a new tweet and add the hashtag #<strong>4yourself</strong> at the end. Your tweet will then be part of the conversation!</p>

<p><strong>Why you should join in!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>Upset with the political system? Join our tweetchat tomorrow, at 11am PST (2pm EST) to talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523independents" rel="noopener noreferrer">#independents</a> &amp; speak <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%25234yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4yourself</a>

â€” Independent Voter (@IVNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/IVNetwork/status/179985635371790336" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>This is a great way for us to go beyond the one-way conversation we provide with our articles and let you speak up and be heard. You can answer questions, ask your own questions, comment on responses, or just come listen.&nbsp;We will also be asking Independent candidates and organizations specific questions about their campaigns and the importance of Independent voters, including Independent presidential candidate&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BuddyRoemer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buddy Roemer</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/CAModOrg" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Moderate Party</a>.</p>
<blockquote>We feel that while there are outlets for Democrats and Republicans to converse, resources for Independent voters are scarce. We want to provide you with a platform to engage with other independent minded people like you and make your voice heard. We want to know what you like and dislike about today's political system. We want to know your take on the 2012 election. We want to know what issues are most important to you!</blockquote>
<p>So just sign in to <a href="http://tweetchat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TweetChat</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> tomorrow at 11am PST and join the conversation!</p>
