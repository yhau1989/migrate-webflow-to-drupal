<p>Today's TweetChat was a major success! We got to hear from independent voters, organizations, and candidates on the role of independents in the 2012 election. We had a lively discussion with contributions from Independent presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/buddy-roemer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buddy Roemer</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/CAModOrg" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Moderate Party</a>, and GOP Communications Strategist <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/alexigrant" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micah Grant</a>. For a recap, here are 5 questions we asked with selected answers from some of the participants:</p>

<p><strong>1. The number of independent voters is on the rise. How significant will their influence be in the 2012 election?</strong></p>
<blockquote>Independent aka "swing" voters always determine winner of the presidency. Congress may be a different story. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%25234yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4yourself</a>

<p><strong>2. What about the Hispanic vote? Why is the GOP ignoring immigration reform?</strong></p>
<blockquote>@<a href="https://twitter.com/IVNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVNetwork</a> Immigration reform is important, but the number one issue for Latinos (like everyone else) is the economy.<a href="https://twitter.com/search/%25234yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4yourself</a>

<p><strong>3. Why are there so many independents, but no one is voting for independent candidates?</strong></p>

<blockquote>@<a href="https://twitter.com/IVNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVNetwork</a> Because most States discriminate against third parties and independent voters in primaries.

<p><strong>4. Question to Buddy Roemer: What's been the most frustrating part of running as an Independent candidate?</strong></p>
<blockquote>@<a href="https://twitter.com/IVNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVNetwork</a> My frustration comes from the control money has in this race.Money = a voice. And it should not be that way. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%25234yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4yourself</a>

<p><strong>5. Pew survey shows Independents further removed from political process than Reps. and Dems. Why is this? And how could candidates best appeal to Independent voters?</strong></p>
