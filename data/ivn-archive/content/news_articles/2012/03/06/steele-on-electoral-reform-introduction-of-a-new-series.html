<p>I have been invited to post a series of short commentaries on the Electoral Reform Act of 2012, a crowd-sourced outline that started in 2000 and was first developed over time by myself with Jim Turner (former #2 to Ralph Nader), Michael Cudahey (former top aid to Barry Goldwater), and Jock Gill (former communications specialist for Bill Clinton).</p>

<p>When Occupy <a href="http://www.phibetaiota.net/2011/09/koko-day-of-rage-17-september-how-will-it-end/" rel="noopener noreferrer">came to my attention</a> on 17 September 2012, I immediately took notice and quickly noticed that Electoral Reform was a key element of the US Day of Rage web page [neither about rage, nor lasting a day].&nbsp; I <a href="http://youtu.be/dt1kZtHXOuo" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke about this</a> to<em> Russia Today TV</em>, that got me a call from a US Day of Rage person, and that led to my briefing the Occupy NYC Electoral Reform Working Group in October, driving my trusty 1964 MGB with Soccer Mom letters (photo below, parked in front of the 60 Wall Street atrium used for meetings).</p>

<p>A <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ER-6Minutes" rel="noopener noreferrer">video was made of me</a> by someone else, speaking for six minutes, and then posted a couple of weeks later to YouTube.&nbsp; It made the front page of Reddit, and went small viral (30,000 main votes, at least a dozen copies).</p>

[caption id="attachment_20729" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Click on Image to Enlarge"][/caption]<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/MGB-Wall-Street-Lite.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="300" src="cloudinary://MGB-Wall-Street-Lite-225x300.jpg" width="225"></a></p>

<p>That in turn -- and this is the important part -- caused a number of stakeholders in electoral reform to get in touch with me, and led to the crowd-sourcing of the Electoral Reform Act of 2012.&nbsp; Now at version 4.4, it started as 2.0.&nbsp; Below are the existing links at <a href="http://bigbatusa.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">We the People Reform Coalition</a>, where I have tried to create a "package" that could be used to mobilize a third-wave campaign--trans-partisan in nature--to trash the two-party tyranny in 2012.</p>
