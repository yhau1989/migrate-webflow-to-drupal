<p><img alt="" src="cloudinary://tumblr_m1gd46yqac1r5afl3o1_1280.gif"><br><br></p><p>A look at how big the health care industry is in America. The first infographic showing the number of people employed in the industry along with the number of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;with college degrees in health care demonstrates its size. The second infographic shows the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of spending in the industry. According to NPR, “If spending keeps climbing as it has, in another 40 years the share of our GDP that goes to health care could be about twice what it is today.”</p>
