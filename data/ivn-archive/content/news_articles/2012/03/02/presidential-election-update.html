<p>Preparing for the last stop before Super Tuesday, the Republican presidential candidates head to Washington to campaign before Saturday's caucuses. The caucuses will be open, meaning anyone registered in the state can vote in tomorrow's caucuses. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/spin-meter-romney-santorum-both-oversell-rivals-appeal-among-non-republican-voters/2012/03/02/gIQAmTx9lR_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post </a>explains:</p>
<blockquote>Saturday’s GOP caucuses in Washington state are open to voters from either party, as are six of the 10 states that have contests on Super Tuesday: Alaska, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia.</blockquote>

Gingrich is leading in Georgia by 9 points, according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/ga/georgia_republican_presidential_primary-1602.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a>. But a win in Georgia will not be enough for a comeback, and as Emory University's political science professor <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20120302newt_gingrich_mines_for_votes_in_the_south_to_break_back_into_race/srvc=home&amp;position=recent" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>,&nbsp;"<em>Georgia’s just one state, but he’ll have to win here and do well in other Southern states.</em>"</p>

<blockquote>“I think that the Israeli government recognizes that, as president of the United States, I don’t bluff. I also don’t, as a matter of sound policy, go around advertising exactly what our intentions are. But (both) governments recognize that when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say.”</blockquote>

This may explain why the Texas Congressman spent almost $40,000 to run ads, while the other candidates have held off on airing ads on cable television.</p>
