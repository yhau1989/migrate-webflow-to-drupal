<p><em>While the legislature is in session, the National Federation of Independent Business/California will be profiling anti-small business bills and initiatives and the adverse effect they would have on California’s job creators.&nbsp; This is the second column of the 2012 series.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to California, the land of fruits, nuts and over-regulation.&nbsp; In this state, we regulate everything from water and air quality to veterinarians and doctors.&nbsp; Now, we aren’t saying all regulations are bad, but what we <em>are</em> saying is that some thought needs to be given to the long-term consequences of any regulations that are imposed.</p>

<p>Take, for example, a recent bill that was introduced in the Senate that would regulate and license pet groomers in California.&nbsp; Senate Bill 969 (Vargas) would mandate any entrepreneur considering opening a pet grooming to pass a state test, and require groomers to pay up to $350 to be licensed by the Veterinary Medical Board.&nbsp; The legislation would also regulate everything from lighting in facilities to how they maintain records.</p>

<p>Proponents claim that the industry needs to be regulated because of a few out-of-the-ordinary incidents that have occurred.&nbsp; While even one incident is too many, is it really necessary to regulate the entire industry?&nbsp; The reality is that this bill has the potential to regulate small business owners who provide these services <em>right out of business</em> due to the cost of compliance, training, and other associated expenses.&nbsp; And those expenses will likely be passed on to the customer who brings their pet in for regular grooming.</p>

<p>Unlike larger businesses with more abundant resources, your average small business owner wears all or most hats in the workplace - accountant, human resources officer, and main employee of the business. Piling on extra compliance burdens means that they won’t be able to focus on growing their business.</p>

<p>So maybe it’s time for the folks in the Capitol to take a step back and let the marketplace weed out the bad businesses.&nbsp; Small business owners largely rely on word-of-mouth advertising and recommendations in order to get and keep business.&nbsp; They know that - unlike government – if they don’t provide good customer service, their business will suffer.&nbsp; That is why it is in their best interest to make sure that they provide good service for a fair price and take care of their customers.</p>

<p>And as they grow their businesses they can hire more employees and support their communities as well.&nbsp; And that is a win-win for everyone.</p>

<p>Our politicians need to stop hamstringing our entrepreneurs with the short, strangling leash of Nanny Government, and instead give them the support and encouragement to do what they do best: create jobs and feed the economy.</p>
