<p>Characterized by uncertainty and indecision, we’re all getting a little weary of the Republican Primary this election. Yesterday, IVN gave you <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/20/illinois-primary-2012-3-reasons-why-it-matters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 reasons </a>why, despite the prolonged election season, the Illinois primary matters:</p>
<p>1. Rick Santorum’s Electability</p>
<p>2. Mitt Romney’s Momentum</p>
<p>3. Obama’s stomping ground&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here are the results - Romney wins by a 10%+ margin. Does this make Santorum irrelevant? Will this give Romney the momentum he needs to close the race before the August Convention? And as much as the media wants you to forget anyone else is running against <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romney</a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rick-santorum/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santorum</a>, let’s not forget about <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ron-paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Paul</a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/newt-gingrich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newt Gingrich</a>, both candidates who are very much still in the race.&nbsp;</p>
