<p>The left has gone bonkers over Rush Limbaugh’s attack on a woman who testified on family planning and birth control at a recent Congressional hearing, and the mild self-rebuke that followed. &nbsp;Limbaugh called the woman a slut and a prostitute for her willingness to deal with intimate, personal issues such as <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/contraception/" rel="noopener noreferrer">contraception</a>.</p>

<p>There is glee across the left end of the web because some of Rush’s sponsors have pulled out of his program, and there seems to be a belief that his demise is near.</p>

<p>Websites such as <a href="www.credoaction.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Credo Action</a> and <a href="http://leftaction.com/action/boycott-rush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Left Action</a> are proclaiming an apocalyptic collapse of all things Rush as a result of the brouhaha.</p>

<p>“Enough is enough,” wrote Left Action. &nbsp;“It is time for Rush Limbaugh's sponsors to stop supporting his hate speech through their advertising dollars.”</p>

<p>And from the Credo Action website:</p>
<blockquote><em>“The backlash has been so great that even after doubling down in defense of his reprehensible comments, Limbaugh was forced to issue a rare -- and totally insufficient -- apology stating ‘my choice of words was not the best’."</em></blockquote>
<p>The reality is likely to be quite different from the left’s doom and gloom perspective because Rush retains a huge and loyal radio audience and wields considerable influence over the political right and the Republican Party.</p>

<p>This issue stemmed from hearings on contraception and the right of religious institutions to refuse to supply contraceptives based on their moral principles.&nbsp; The hearings, held by Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA), <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/16/whats-wrong-with-this-picture/" rel="noopener noreferrer">famously featured only men</a> in its initial panel.&nbsp; One woman who sought the opportunity to testify – Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke –was rejected by Issa, but was invited to testify at a subsequent <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic</a> hearing on the same subject.</p>

<p>After her testimony supporting access to free or low-cost contraceptives through any medical provider, Fluke was attacked by Limbaugh<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/rush-limbaugh-calls-law-student-a-slut-wanting-contraception-covered-health-insurance-religious-institutions-article-1.1031283" rel="noopener noreferrer"> with these words</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>"What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute... She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception."</em></blockquote>
<p>Limbaugh has since made the following <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-for-verbal-attack/" rel="noopener noreferrer">apology</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>“For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.”</em></blockquote>
<p>Credo Action proudly proclaimed, “Since we started our campaign, several major advertisers have pulled their support from the Rush Limbaugh Show.”&nbsp; Those advertisers<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/03/some-sponsors-rush-away-from-limbaughs-show/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> include</a> LegalZoom, Quicken Loans and Sleep Number, according to ABC News.</p>

<p>There is no question that Limbaugh’s description of Ms. Fluke was horrendous.&nbsp; But the reality is that a radio show as popular as Rush Limbaugh’s likely has a backlog of advertisers ready to replace those who have departed.&nbsp; In addition, once this dust-up has subsided, major advertisers who have jumped ship are likely to return.&nbsp; The chances that this event will be fatal or even seriously damaging to the Rush Limbaugh Show seem remote.&nbsp; Fans of Limbaugh will not take his tepid apology seriously, and Rush is unlikely to change his style, politics or approach enough for anyone to notice a difference.</p>

<p>In fact, it is a sign of Limbaugh’s authority in the political arena that the left has reacted so strongly.&nbsp; Rather than weaken him, the left's attacks strengthen his hand and increase his influence with an audience that already distrusts liberalism and is unlikely to feel outrage by his comments.</p>
