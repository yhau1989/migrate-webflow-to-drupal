<p>The issue of health care has turned into a bitter partisan debate, with the Republican led House <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/22/politics/health-care-ipab/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">voting Thursday</a> to repeal the 2010 reform law. CNN reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“The repeal measure passed 223-181 on a mostly party-line vote, reflecting the deep partisan divide over health care reform that persists two years after Democrats pushed the measure through Congress.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an independent, what’s your opinion on Obama’s&nbsp;health care reform? Is partisanship getting in the way of helping the uninsured?&nbsp;</p>
