<p>As a follow-up to my <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/08/14/on-the-media-media-scrutiny-theater/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> which profiled NPR's broadcast "On the Media" and its feature "Media Scrutiny Theater", I'm updating with their latest video posted yesterday. The video comments on an ad which was funded by President Obama's super PAC attacking Mitt Romney and his healthcare policy record. It exemplifies the media tactics used to manipulate public opinion. The specific tactic of this ad is geared towards exploiting people's emotional sensitivity and pinning Mitt Romney as a monster.</p>
