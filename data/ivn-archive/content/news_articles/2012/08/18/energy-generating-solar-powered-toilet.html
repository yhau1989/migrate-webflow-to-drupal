<p>The California Institute of Technology has been awarded $100,000 by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for a <a href="http://inhabitat.com/bill-gates-awards-100000-prize-to-caltech-for-solar-powered-toilet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">solar-powered toilet that recycles water and produces energy</a>. A primary focus of the Gates Foundation and their <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/watersanitationhygiene/Pages/home.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinvent The Toilet Challenge</a> is sanitation in Third World countries.</p>
<blockquote>The solar toilet stall uses a large panel to generate power for an electrochemical reactor that breaks down feces and urine into hydrogen gas. The gas can then be stored in fuel cells that provide back-up electricity for low light weather conditions or at night. Recovered water, which become sanitized through operation of the toilet, is used to flush.</blockquote>
