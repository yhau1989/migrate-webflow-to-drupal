<p>Keeping up in the digital world has arguably been a struggle for the Republican Party, more often than not coming in second to the tech-savvy ways of Democratic leaders in social media. &nbsp;But things might change this year, as they unveil their Republican National Convention App, "<a href="http://www.attrnc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa 2012</a>", just one week after the Democrat's release of their <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/08/07/democratic-national-convention-releases-its-mobile-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer">own mobile app</a>.</p>

<p>Could they be catching on to the importance of social media? Their Convention app features many of the same features as the Democratic app: live-stream of events, maps to aid in navigating around the Convention, social sharing etc.</p>
<p>Carrying the convention's theme of &nbsp;"Convention Without Walls" into the digital world, the Republican app will incorporate <strong>Google Hangouts</strong> as a way for followers to connect with speakers during the convention, distinguishing it from the Democrat's app. The RNC will also include updates on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Foursquare, and their official website, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/244161-republican-national-convention-releases-mobile-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports The Hill</a>, reflecting the committee's attempt at utilizing all digital platforms.</p>

<p>In a statement about the new mobile app,&nbsp;Ken Jones, president of the convention host committee explained the GOP's&nbsp;reasoning behind designing the app:</p>

<blockquote><em>Four years ago, at the last convention, iPhones and other smart phones were just making their debut,” said Ken Jones, president of the convention host committee, in a statement.&nbsp;“Now, these devices are everywhere, and we have the fantastic opportunity to provide our guests, and the public who are interested in the convention, with a mobile application that is cutting edge, easy to use and fun.</em></blockquote>
<div>The GOP not only provides its attendees with the resources&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to navigate and document their experience at the 2012 convention, but they bring the convention to the viewer at home with their inclusion of the up-and-coming Google feature of Hangouts.</div>

<div>We give the GOP <strong>+1</strong> for including Google into their mobile strategy.</div>
