<p>With the growing trend in social media, there has been a sharp spike in the number of social networks available. Many of us have multiple social profiles, and utilize a variety of social networks, each for a different reason.</p>

<p>Take Pinterest, for example.&nbsp;Pinterest recently exploded in popularity, transforming the way in which we plan events, keep track of trends, and advertise our products. And while the majority of Pinterest users are women, who likely have at least one board devoted to fashion finds, adorable animals, or&nbsp;whimsical&nbsp;weddings, there is the male counterpart.</p>

<p>So which social network takes home the gold? Well, it depends what you're looking for. <a href="http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/social-media-stats/2012-social-network-analysis-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ignite Social Media</a> recently released an infographic comparing social media platforms, looking at statistics about gender, demographics, interests etc.</p>

<p>Some key findings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The overall number of men using social media is the same as the overall number of women using social media, with the male/female ratio evenly split at 50/50.</li>
	<li>Pinterest hosts the highest number of women users, followed by Habbo, IMVU, and Flixster. Surprised?</li>
	<li>Wealthier users tend to populate social networks like LinkedIn, Yelp, and Quora.</li>
</ul>
