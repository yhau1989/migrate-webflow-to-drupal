<p>As a French living in the U.S., I have faced many stereotypes and have had to deny most of them. Stereotypes can be offensive, weird, very true, funny, or plain stupid. In any case, they are a part of any experience abroad, so we better get used to it. Overall, I think that stereotypes are interesting, as they force us to reflect on the way we are seen by the rest of the world, for better or for worse. Thus, I will be posting regularly on the topic from various angles.</p>

<p>For this first post, I decided to focus on various maps highlighting our different visions of the world, from the French and American point of view.</p>

<p>The world according to the <a href="http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/298-the-world-as-seen-from-paris" rel="noopener noreferrer">French (or more precisely Parisians)</a> :</p>

<p>The world according to the American:</p>

<p>Europe according to <a href="http://alphadesigner.com/mapping-stereotypes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the French</a>:</p>

<p>Europe according to <a href="http://alphadesigner.com/mapping-stereotypes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the American</a>:</p>

<p>I know that the two examples from the French point of view are sadly quite true for the most part. Is it the same with the American examples?</p>
