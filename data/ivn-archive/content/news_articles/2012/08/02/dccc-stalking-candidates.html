<p>Concerns over potential invasion of privacy has lawmakers from both parties railing against certain campaign behavior they say is going "too far". As <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79328.html#ixzz22PymyjQh" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> originally reports, House members have sent a letter to both the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee concerning tactics used by political trackers.</p>

<p>“We believe filing candidates, sometimes with hidden cameras, while they take care of routine family activities like grocery shopping and posting videos of their private residences is a step too far,” says the letter.</p>

<p>Rep. Reid Ribble, a Wisconsin Republican, and Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Democrat from Ohio, authored the letter. It collected roughly 50 bipartisan signatures by Wednesday night.</p>

<p>It comes after a 30-second video recording of the outside of Rep. Ribble's Wisconsin home was posted on YouTube, a result of Democratic trackers, according to a previous <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79328.html#ixzz22PymyjQh" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> report. The instance caused media attention on DCCC tactics in July.</p>

Politico</a> continues:</p>
<blockquote><em>"The DCCC has stood by its practice of filming homes and placing them on YouTube, arguing that it wants to cast House Republicans — especially those who are wealthy and have large homes — as out of touch with struggling American families. By placing the videos online, the DCCC is hoping that like-minded outside groups will use the footage in TV ads this fall."</em></blockquote>
