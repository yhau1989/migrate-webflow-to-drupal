<p><span>Fun Facts:</span></p>

<p>1. While President of the United States, whenever John Adams had the chance, he chose to spend his time at his farm in Quincy, Massachusetts. His daily farm-life routine consisted of waking up at sunrise and downing a “gill” of hard cider. A "gill" is the equivalent to half of a pint.</p>

<p>2. By today’s standards, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were ‘frenemies.’ Both were extremely intelligent men and famous Founding Fathers of the United States. However each held incredibly different views on government and disagreed on nearly everything. While John Adams was president the two men ceased all contact until, their mutual friend, Benjamin Franklin, was able to rekindle some sort of relationship. This newfound relationship incited the men to begin writing letters to each other. The pen pals’ correspondence “remains one of the most extraordinary in the English language, reflecting the thoughts, fears, ideals, and geniuses of two of history’s most outstanding intellects.” Ironically, both men died on the same day July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.”</p>
