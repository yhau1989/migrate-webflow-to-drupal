<p>Gore Vidal was a prolific writer and critic of American society. He passed away on Tuesday, July 31st, 2012.</p>

<p>A one-time candidate for Senate, one of his most memorable quotes was on the topic of the two main modern political parties:</p>
<blockquote><em>There is only one party in the United States, the Property Party&nbsp;... and it has two right wings: Republican and Democrat. Republicans are a bit stupider, more rigid, more doctrinaire in their laissez-faire capitalism than the Democrats, who are cuter, prettier, a bit more corrupt&nbsp;â€” until recently&nbsp;... and more willing than the Republicans to make small adjustments when the poor, the black, the anti-imperialists get out of hand. But, essentially, there is no difference between the two parties.</em></blockquote>
