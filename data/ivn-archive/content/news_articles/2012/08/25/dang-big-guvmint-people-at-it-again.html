<p>Cranky Yankee wonders just how many government give-aways can you fit on the head of a pin? &nbsp;And who's regulating pinhead crowding? &nbsp;You don't suppose there's a federal basic research program for that, now do you?</p>



<p>Listen to how the candidate backs federal support for renewable energy:</p>



<p>"Instead of distorting the playing field, the government should be ensuring that it remains level.&nbsp;The same policies that will open access to land for oil, gas, and coal development can also open access for the construction of wind, solar, and hydropower facilities.</p>

<blockquote>"Strengthening and streamlining regulations and permitting processes will benefit the development of both traditional and alternative energy sources, and encourage the use of a&nbsp;diverse range of fuels&nbsp;including natural gas in transportation....



"The federal government has a role to play in facilitating innovation in the energy industry.&nbsp;History shows that the United States has moved forward in astonishing ways thanks to&nbsp;investments in basic research that have produced breakthroughs to benefit entire industries."</blockquote>

<p>You want someone like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-solar-and-wind-energy-2012-8#ixzz24TYACFqW" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> to be President?</p>
