<p>The new photovoltaic cells are <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2012/08/24/ibm-researchers-have-developed-record-breaking-pv-cells/" rel="noopener noreferrer">made from inexpensive natural materials</a>, scalable, and produce 10% more power than comparable cells. Wow.</p>

<p>IBM developed them working with "partners from Solar Frontier, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo and DelSolar" and hopes to have them on the market in a the next few years.</p>
