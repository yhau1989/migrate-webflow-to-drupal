<p>A professor at the University of Calgary has created a Twitter account that, with the help of a computer program, generates&nbsp;parodies&nbsp;of Mitt Romney's tweets. Rightly called <a href="https://twitter.com/TransforMitt" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TransforMitt</a>, the program was reportedly a Facebook experiment gone awry. Either way, these <a href="https://twitter.com/TransforMitt" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweets</a> are pure comedy.</p>

<p>How it works: "Aycock’s computer-generated tweets replace a few words from Romney’s tweets with a few of its own. Aycock then proofs them, to make sure nothing inappropriate or offensive gets through." - <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/offbeat/story/2012/08/10/calgary-twitter-parody-computer-science.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBN</a>. Similar to the computer-generated tweets found on <a href="https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks" rel="noopener noreferrer">@horse_ebooks</a>, but way more coherent and in full sentences. Also, I'd argue, much more relevant in today's political climate (nothing against low quality e-books about horses).</p>

<p>So why does a Canadian care about poking fun at U.S. politicians? He explains on his <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/transformitt.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, "Timing. No major elections in Canada right now."</p>

<p>Let's compare some of Romney's most recent tweets, to those generated by <a href="https://twitter.com/TransforMitt" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TransforMitt</a>:</p>
