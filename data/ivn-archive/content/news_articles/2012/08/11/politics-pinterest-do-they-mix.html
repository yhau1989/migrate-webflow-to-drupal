<p>Launched in 2010, Pinterest worked its ways up the ranks of social networks to become the fastest-growing site in history, passing 10 million users in nine short months. The image-based network, as I'm sure you have seen, allows you to create boards based on categories and upload and share images, creating a scrapbook-like album or collection of images.</p>

<p>The website now hosts 20 million users, and that number is about to sky rocket. <strong>Announced this week,</strong>&nbsp;Pinterest will be ditching its invite-only policy and opening the doors of creativity up to everyone.</p>

<p>"We're really excited to have the capacity to offer Pinterest to more people, and if you're a Pinner with friends who've been waiting on the sidelines, we hope you'll let them know."</p>

<p>What used to be the exclusive "club" of pinners is now an open forum, for everyone to gather, organizing, and share their favorite photos.&nbsp;So it makes sense that political organizations, politicians, and candidates will likely jump on the Pinterest band-wagon.</p>

<p>But how can they compete in a world dominated by recipe books and bridal fever? Mashable came out with "<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/05/27/politicians-pinterest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Tips For Politicians on Pinterest</a>" to guide lawmakers and candidate through the social network.&nbsp;Some things to keep in mind:</p>

	<li>Interact, Don't just Broadcast</li>
	<li>It's Not Just for Women</li>
	<li>Don't Pin and Ditch</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>You be the judge: How are politicians using the social network in creative ways to reach constituents and bolster their campaigns?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering, of course we're on <a href="http://pinterest.com/ivnetwork/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>:</p>
