<p>Well, the first attacks on Mitt Romney's VP pick are out from the Obama campaign are out, and the Obama campaign has targeted the Paul&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79584.html?hp=l1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan entitlement reform</a>&nbsp;plan. In a campaign marked by a lack of enthusiasm for and countless errors from the GOP's candidate, this could be exactly the direction the GOP are ready to head.</p>

<p>From an unsolicited Obama campaign e-mail:</p>
<blockquote>Congressman Paul Ryan is best known as the author of a budget so radical&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;called it "the most extreme budget plan passed by a House of Congress in modern times." With Mitt Romney's support, Ryan would end Medicare as we know it and slash the investments we need to keep our economy growing -- all while cutting taxes for those at the very top.

Over the next few days, Romney's campaign and its allies will tell a very different story about Paul Ryan.

<strong>Our job is to make sure Americans know the truth about what Romney's choice says about him as a candidate and leader, and to stand with President Obama and Vice President Biden at another major moment in this campaign.</strong></blockquote>
