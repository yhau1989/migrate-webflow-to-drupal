<p>Though the Mitt Romney campaign app <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/08/10/twitter-preemits-romney-vp-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer">got off to a slow start</a>, it has finally caught up to the social networks like Twitter that virally spread <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/10/mitt-romney-vp-pick-paul-ryan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">news reports of a possible Paul Ryan pick</a> late Friday, and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/11/us-usa-campaign-romney-idUSBRE87919120120811" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed those reports</a> early Saturday with these words:</p>
<blockquote>"Mitt's choice for VP is Paul Ryan. Spread the word about America's comeback team."</blockquote>
<p>Now that the congressman from Wisconsin, known for his fiscal policy rhetoric, is Mitt Romney's confirmed running mate, <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/11/a-closer-look-at-rep-paul-ryans-voting-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Ryan's voting record</a> and political philosophy will face closer national scrutiny than ever before.</p>
