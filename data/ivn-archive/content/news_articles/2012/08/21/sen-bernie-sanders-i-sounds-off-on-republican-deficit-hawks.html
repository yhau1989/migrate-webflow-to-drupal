<p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of only two independents in the Senate, is known for being outspoken. This reputation is only aided by a prolific presence on social media. His office regularly posts video to YouTube. One of the latest is on the topic of deficit reduction, and what he views are inflexible Republicans. He speaks unguarded, straight to the camera, with no notes. It's a good example of how technology can spread his viewpoints to his constituents and a broader public with the stroke of a button.</p>
