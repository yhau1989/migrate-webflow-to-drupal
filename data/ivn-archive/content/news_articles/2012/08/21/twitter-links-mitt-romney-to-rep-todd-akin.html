<p>After the highly controversial "<a href="http://ivn.us/neutral-zone/2012/08/20/prominent-republicans-break-ties-with-todd-akin/" rel="noopener noreferrer">legitimate rape</a>" comments made by Rep. Todd Akin, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have made a conscious effort to distance themselves from the Republican Representative, calling for Akin to <a href="http://ivn.us/icon/2012/08/20/republicans-push-for-todd-akin-to-leave-senate-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">drop out</a> of the Missouri Senate race. According to Twitter, however, their attempts are futile, as users on Twitter increasingly link Romney to Akin:</p>

<p>"Akin is one of the top 10 topics people are talking about when they tweet about Romney on Tuesday, according to <a href="http://www.polipulse.com/#dashboard" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PoliPulse</strong></a>, a social media monitoring tool from the PR firm Powell Tate," The Hill's Twitter Room <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/244515-romney-linked-to-rep-akin-in-twitter-conversations" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>.</p>

<p>As of 3 p.m. PST, Akin was ranked second as Romney's key topics, meaning that after Paul Ryan, it is the most talked about subject relating to Romney's name on Twitter.</p>

<p>Using just one word, "<a href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/238026595997216768" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awesome</a>", former Senior Adviser to President Barack Obama, David Axelrod linked to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-doctor-behind-todd-akins-rape-theory-was-a-romney-surrogate-in-2007-20120821,0,80862.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> Los Angeles Times article on Twitter. The article suggests that the doctor behind Rep. Todd Akin's was an "important surrogate" for Romney's 2008 presidential bid.</p>
