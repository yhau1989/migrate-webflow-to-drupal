<p>Among the guests who will be speaking at the Republican National Convention this August is Rep. Artur Davis, who crossed party lines in 2010, abandoning the Democratic Party in favor of the GOP.&nbsp;The announcement came as a shock to some, as Davis was a co-chairman of President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>With a focus this week on politicians who dare to cross party lines and the Republican National Convention at the end of the month, it's important to highlight the RNC Chairman's reasons for including this former Democrat in the convention. Unlike long-time Republicans, Davis' involvement in the Obama campaign can "give voice to the frustration and disappointment felt among those who supported President Obama in 2008 and are now hungry for a new direction."</p>

<p>The Washington Times, however, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/16/crossing-convention-aisles-ex-democrat-davis-to-sp/" rel="noopener noreferrer">argues</a> that it may be a publicity stunt.</p>
<blockquote><em>As party conventions, once used to select presidential nominees, have turned into pep rallies for the party faithful, the campaigns have sought other ways to make them newsworthy. And politicians willing to cross party lines are one way to do that.</em>

<em>Democrats are still searching for their own version of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artur-davis/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Davis</a>&nbsp;this year.</em></blockquote>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Rep. Artur Davis, here's his explanation for why he left the Democratic Party:</p>

<p>The Democratic Party has revealed that they too will look outside their party to find dynamic speakers for this year's convention. Any guesses as to who it could be?</p>
