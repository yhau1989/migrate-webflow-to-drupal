<blockquote>[O]nly 22% of Likely U.S. Voters believe it is possible to run for president in todayâ€™s world without having ties to any lobbyists and special interest groups. Fifty-seven percent (57%) disagree and say it is not possible to seek the presidency without ties to lobbyists and special interest groups. Twenty-one percent (21%) are not sure.</blockquote>
