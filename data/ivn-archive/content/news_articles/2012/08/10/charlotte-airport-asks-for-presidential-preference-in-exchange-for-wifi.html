<p>The Charlotte Douglas International Airport is leveraging the Internet as a way to learn more about the presidential preference of the city's visitors, by asking this question before granting access to WiFi Connection:&nbsp;<em><strong>"</strong></em><strong>Suppose the presidential election were held today, Who would you be more likely to vote for?" </strong>Gearing up to host the Democratic National Convention, the poll seems like an attempt to gauge popularity of the Convention.</p>

<p>As reported by BuzzFeed:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Charlotte Douglas International Airport appears to be polling its visitors on their presidential preference, as the city prepares for the Democratic National Convention at the beginning of September.</em>

<em>A traveler seeking to log on to the airport wifi this morning was met with this questionnaire powered by Google Insights, a common online consumer survey tool with an unusual question.</em>

<em>An airport representative didn't respond to an inquiry left on its media line.</em></blockquote>
<p>Would you share your presidential preference in order to get on the web?</p>

<p>UPDATE: A spokesperson says it is not Charlotte Douglas International Airport conducting the questionnaire.</p>

<p>"CLT Airport does not ask for any presidential preferences to access our free Wi-Fi. The survey was conducted in violation of our policy by a third-party advertiser," they say.</p>
