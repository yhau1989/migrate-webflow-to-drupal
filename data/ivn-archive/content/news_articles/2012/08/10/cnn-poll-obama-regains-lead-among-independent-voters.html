<p>A new CNN poll shows that independent voters are turning their backs on the former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>“Among independent voters, the poll indicates President Obama has a 53%-42% lead,”&nbsp;<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/09/cnn-poll-obama-holds-7-point-lead-over-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN Polling Director Keating Holland told CNN.com</a></p>

<p>Looking back to <a href="http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/polls/4ff2018f8906b655e100008d" rel="noopener noreferrer">July</a>, Romney led among independent voters, holding a 12 point lead over the President of the United States.</p>

<p>CNN <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/09/cnn-poll-obama-holds-7-point-lead-over-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">elaborates</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Among independents, the poll indicates Romney's image has taken a beating. In May, only 40% of independents had an unfavorable view of Romney. Now, 52% of independents have a negative view of him.</blockquote>
<p>Could it be his recent trip abroad? Harry Reid's accusations? Or is this poll just inaccurate?</p>

<p><em>I wonder what the poll would look like if they included third party candidates...</em></p>
