<blockquote>The new battery can power an electric car up to 100 miles, but their goal is to reach 200 miles between charges. "I think weâ€™ve got better than a 50-50 chance to develop a car that will go to 200 miles on a charge," [GM CEO Dan] Akerson said. "<a href="http://inhabitat.com/gms-new-battery-could-extend-ev-driving-range-to-200-miles/" rel="noopener noreferrer">That would be a game changer</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Their new lithium-ion batteries would also be substantially less expensive than existing electric car batteries.</p>
