<p>The Huntsmans made headlines today, with both father and son creating quite a stir in the world of Twitter. Starting with Jon Huntsman Sr., Twitter erupted with speculation that he could be that super secret source to Harry Reid's claims about Romney and his failure to pay his taxes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/jon-huntsman-sr-longtime-romney-backer-calls-on-him-to-release-tax-returns/2012/08/10/9f343a8c-e312-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Sargent</a> of the Washington Post spoke with Jon Huntsman Sr. on the phone, who confirmed that he is not the source to Harry Reid's accusations. He did, however, say this:</p>
<blockquote>"I feel very badly that Mitt won't release his taxes and won't be fair with the American people."

He continued,&nbsp;“Mr. Romney ought to square with the American people and release his taxes like any other candidate,” Huntsman said. “I’ve supported Mitt all along. I wish him well. But I do think he should release his income taxes.”</blockquote>

<p>There has also been speculation over whether Republican Jon Huntsman will be speaking at the Democratic National Convention this year.</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>According to very credible sources, Huntsman has accepted a speaking slot at the Democrat convention in Charlotte next month. - <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/08/10/sources-former-gop-candidate-huntsman-to-speak-at-DNC-convention" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breitbart</a></strong></em></blockquote>
<p>Again, these are all rumors.&nbsp;Consequently, Twitter is buzzing about both former GOP presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman and his father, Jon Huntsman Sr. Here are some of today's tweets:</p>
