<p><img alt="" height="300" src="cloudinary://federal-court-to-reconsider-marijuana-dangerous-drug-classification-54460.png" title="marijuana court" width="450">It's been almost 20 years since a question regarding the classification of marijuana laws has been heard in federal court. &nbsp;But, on October 16th, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit <a href="http://www.safeaccessnow.org/federal-court-will-review-marijuanas-classification-as-a-dangerous-drug-with-no-health-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer">will hear arguments</a> challenging marijuana's schedule 1 status. The status means that the DEA considers Marijuana to be a dangerous <a href="http://ivn.us/category/issues/drugs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">drug</a> with no medical value and a "high potential for abuse." &nbsp;As more and more states pass laws legalizing the drug for medicinal use, this status has created considerable <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/31/medical-marijuana-shops-banned-los-angeles-city-council/" rel="noopener noreferrer">conflict</a> between <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/13/feds-crack-down-on-dispenseries-as-medical-marijuana-study-asks-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal</a> and <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_19,_the_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2010)" rel="noopener noreferrer">state laws</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The support for legalization has grown dramatically over the last decade. &nbsp;During that time&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/06/13/498675/seven-more-states-may-legalize-medical-marijuana-in-2012/" rel="noopener noreferrer">17 states</a>, plus Washington DC, have legalized the drug. This year, another seven states are considering bills or voter initiatives that would do the same.</p>

<p>Recent polling suggests&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/05/17/485309/poll-says-back-off-weed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">3/4 of Americans</a>&nbsp;are in favor of legalized medical marijuana and support for complete legalization has reached an&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/10/17/346095/support-marijuana-historical-high/" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time high</a>&nbsp;of 50%. Constitutional, economic, medical, and safety arguments have all been made in favor of&nbsp;legalization; arguments that will be used in court to challenge the federal court's classification of marijuana's schedule 1 status as "arbitrary and capricious."</p>

<p>What do you think with happen on October 16th? What's your position?</p>
