<p><img alt="" height="440" src="cloudinary://1570.gif" title="1570" width="318">Today's <a href="http://pewresearch.org/databank/dailynumber/?NumberID=1570" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily number</a> at Pew Research Center's The Databank is 42 - representing the percent of independents who regard Mitt Romney's choice for VP, Paul Ryan, as an "only fair" or "poor" choice. Compared to Biden, however, this number fairs well, with the majority of independents agreeing that Biden has only done a "fair" or "poor" job as Vice President.</p>

<p>Pew Reports:</p>
<blockquote><em>However, independents are even more negative on Joseph Biden when they are asked to rate the job he has done as Vice President. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) say he has done an "only fair" or "poor" job compared to 22% who give him positive marks.</em></blockquote>
<p>Biden has also received low ratings from his own party, with just over half of Democrats confident in his job as VP.</p>

<p>What's missing from this survey, however, is analysis on where the third party vice presidential picks stand. Judge Jim Gray (Libertarian Party) and&nbsp;Cheri Honkala (Green Party) have been left off the survey, leaving independents with just two choices, both of which seem unfavorable.</p>

<p><em><strong>Where do you stand on vice presidential picks? Do you feel as if you're voting for the lesser of two evils?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
