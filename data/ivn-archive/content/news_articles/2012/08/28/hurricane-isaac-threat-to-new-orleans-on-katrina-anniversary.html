<p>Hurricane Isaac threat to New Orleans has failed to spark a national debate on global warming but it will test the city's new levee system.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast Aug. 29, 2005 devastating New Orleans and killing over 1,800 people. Now <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/212348.shtml?5-daynl" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurricane Isaac</a> threatens to hit the city seven years later.</p>
<p>“It is quite ironic that we have a hurricane threatening us on the seventh anniversary of Katrina,” New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said at a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/48793753" rel="noopener noreferrer">press conference</a> Monday.</p>

<p>Tropical Storm Isaac will be a <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Category 1 or 2 hurricane</a>, but it will not reach the strength of Katrina.</p>

<p>The eerie reminder of the devastation Katrina brought to the city and the political missteps that followed have some residents on edge while others remain unfazed.</p>

<p>“I want to tell everybody now that I believe that we will be OK,” Landrieu added. "There is nothing this storm will bring us that we are not capable of handling."</p>

<p>According to Landrieu, the levees had over <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/27/us/tropical-storm-isaac/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 billion in improvements</a> since Katrina and the city's pump stations are poised with backup generators.</p>

<p>Colonel Edward Fleming, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said those <a href="http://media.nola.com/hurricane_impact/other/hurricane-protection-graphic-2012.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">improvements</a> to the system will put the city in a far better position than it was seven years ago.</p>

<p>Tim Doody, the president of the levee board that oversees Orleans and St. Bernard Parishes, is not satisfied with the 100-year storm level of protection.</p>

<p>“Other developed countries are building to a much higher standard,” <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1208/27/sitroom.03.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told CNN</a>. "Surely it's going to be more expensive to do that, but a 100-year standard is not what we would have them build to. We would like 500-year or a 1,000-year.”</p>

<p>But <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/us/vast-defenses-now-shielding-new-orleans.html?pagewanted=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Doody</a>, the nation would only pay for, and FEMA would only insure, the current level of protection which is expected to easily ward off Hurricane Isaac.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Issues</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Despite the near-collision Hurricane Isaac had with the <a href="http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/morning-market-maven/2012/aug/28/republican-convention-2012-opens-today-tampa/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican National Convention</a>, there has been little talk about the environment and climate change.</p>

<p>Both parties have dismissed environmental issues in favor of talking about the hot ticket items such as the economy and healthcare.</p>

<p>Senator&nbsp;Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who often votes with Democrats, said at a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-01/drought-heat-shows-climate-change-is-real-democrats-say.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">hearing on&nbsp;climate change:</a></p>

<p>“We can’t run away from the issue. We need to put it front and center.”</p>

<p>This year alone, the United States has experienced <a href="http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nationwide drought</a>, warmer winters and now Hurricane Isaac.</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Democratic_Party_Environment.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic Party platform</a> rejects the choice of a healthy economy over a healthy environment, politics seems to be forcing their hand to do so.</p>

<p>President Obama has voiced his concerns of climate change and has dubbed it a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/08/27/749571/gop-climate-change-obama-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">severe threat</a> although he has not made efforts to bring the issue to the forefront of his campaign as he previously said he would.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a debate that will become part of the campaign,” he <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75590.html#ixzz24ra9CUAX" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Rolling Stone Magazine in April</a>. “And I will be very clear in voicing my belief that we're going to have to take further steps to deal with climate change in a serious way."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Republican_Party_Environment.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican Party</a> has long been in favor of using market-based solutions to environmental problems but has also adamantly denied man-made climate change.</p>

<p>A year ago, Gov. Romney&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/56580.html#ixzz1c6rbDYh7" rel="noopener noreferrer">told&nbsp;a crowd</a>&nbsp;that he believed "the world is getting warmer, and I believe that humans have contributed to that.”</p>

<p>But Romney has since decided that he <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/10/28/355736/romney-flips-to-denial-we-dont-know-whats-causing-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer">is no longer sure</a> if humans have contributed and that spending the money to try to reduce CO2 emissions “is not the right course for us."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPA</a> carefully credits climate change to “changes in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html#greenhouseeffect" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse effect</a>, variations in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html#changessun" rel="noopener noreferrer">the sun’s energy</a>&nbsp;reaching Earth and changes in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html#changesreflectivity" rel="noopener noreferrer">reflectivity</a>&nbsp;of Earth’s atmosphere and surface," clearly trying to remain out of the politics of the issue.</p>

<p>Whether one thinks climate change is caused by man or a natural phenomenon, it is becoming more difficult to deny its existence. At the same time, climate change has become a deeply polarized issue, stalling any protective or preventative action.</p>
