<p>Interviewed by CNN's Don Lemon, they discussed ending the two-party monopoly, the media's role in the election, and what can be done to fix the system.&nbsp;When asked <em>"Do you feel like you are shut out of the process in any way?"</em> both candidates agreed that the two-party system is broken.</p>

<p>Gary Johnson answered,</p>
<blockquote><em>"Completely, if it were reported tomorrow that I were at 5% of the national vote, the overwhelming reaction to that would be who the hell is Gary Johnson and that would be a good thing.

<p>Buddy Roemer agreed, responding,</p>
<blockquote><em>"It is broken. The largest party in American is the independents. The party growing the fastest in America today, and check the facts, is the independent party. We have 90 million Americans that won't vote in November. This country is in trouble and most people feel like there are no choices."</em></blockquote>
