<p>Virtually all of Iceland's power comes from <a href="http://inhabitat.com/iceland-gets-99-5-of-its-energy-from-renewable-sources-but-how-clean-is-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer">geothermal and hydroelectric power</a>. Both are clean sources of renewable energy. The UK wants to import some of that power.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/geothermal-energy-may-be-promising-for-the-u-s/855383/" rel="noopener noreferrer">US has abundant geothermal resources,</a> we just need to harness them.</p>
<blockquote>Geothermal power may be a viable form of energy for the U.S., according to an interdisciplinary panel from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Researchers from MIT suggest that there is a great deal of geothermal potential within the country and if this energy can be tapped, it could the country move away from fossil-fuel</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.savingiceland.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saving Iceland</a> says geothermal power can produce some forms of pollution but still, it's way cleaner than coal.</p>
