<h6>&nbsp;<strong>This Week on IVN: <em>Education</em></strong></h6>
<div>

Back-to-school time is approaching and&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN.us</a>&nbsp;is getting ahead of the curve. This week's theme: <strong><em>Education!</em></strong>

We'll be looking at issues like voter education, social media in the classroom, head start programs, vouchers, and student debt this week.

What are candidates proposing? How can we find independent, non-partisan solutions to the many problems arising from our education system?
