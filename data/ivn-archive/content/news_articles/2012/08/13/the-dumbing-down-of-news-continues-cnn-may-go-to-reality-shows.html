<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/cnn-to-save-itself-by-featuring-less-news.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN plans to feature more reality shows</a> and less of that tedious news stuff in a desperate, misguided, and futile attempt to save its ratings.</p>
<blockquote>An anonymous producer who's attended the meetings says it's like, "that moment when MTV decided to stop playing music videos."</blockquote>
<p>If CNN goes that route and dumbs down or eliminates hard news then they will no longer be a news channel. Instead they should focus on why their ratings are plunging and do something about it.</p>

<p>While MSNBC, FoxNews, and CNN do sometimes have serious reporting and investigations in general their content is deteriorating. And now CNN wants to make it official.</p>

<p>This leaves the BBC as the best news provider on the planet, bar none. But then, it always has been.</p>
