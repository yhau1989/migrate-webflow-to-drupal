<p>Late Friday, national Republican Party officials released their decision to back the actions of Louisiana state GOP leaders over a dispute with Ron Paul supporters concerning convention delegates.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/ron_paul_challenge_to_lagop_co.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Times-Picayune</a> recounts the dispute:</p>
<blockquote><em>The crux of the Ron Paul challenge was that the state party brass changed the rules of the June 2 state convention in Shreveport at the last minute in order to thwart the will of the Ron Paul majority elected in Congressional District Caucuses in April.</em></blockquote>

<p>Since April, Ron Paul supporters have protested the state's execution of the party convention was illegal. The state convention in Shreveport made waves for the contentious atmosphere. The dispute over convention representation led the state GOP and Ron Paul Louisiana supporters to break off into two, nominating competing sets of delegates.</p>

<p>"The LAGOP executive committee again submitted false information in an attempt to mislead their fellow Republicans," said Charlie Davis, who led the Paul campaign in Louisiana, according to <a href="http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20120813/NEWS01/120813002/National-GOP-nixes-Ron-Paul-claim-La-delegates-?odyssey=nav|head" rel="noopener noreferrer">the AP</a>.</p>

<p>Ron Paul supporters are challenging the decision and will appeal directly to the committee this week, reports the <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/ron_paul_challenge_to_lagop_co.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Times-Picayune</a>.</p>
