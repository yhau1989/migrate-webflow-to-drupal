<p>On Friday at Arlington Cemetery, the US Army <a href="http://jezebel.com/5934037/the-us-army-says-hello-to-its-first-openly-gay-general?utm_campaign=socialflow_jezebel_facebook&amp;utm_source=jezebel_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow" rel="noopener noreferrer">promoted</a> its first openly gay general. Brig. Gen. Tammy Smith had her new star pinned on her by her wife Tracey at the ceremony.</p>

<p>A year ago the couple was unable to appear together at military functions until the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Smith is now the highest-ranking gay or lesbian officer to acknowledge her sexuality during service.</p>

<p>The couple married a year ago after dating for nine years. Tammy Smith’s wife, Tracey Hepner, was a part of the Pentagon’s review of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. During the review Defense Department officials could not speak to gay service members without outing them, so they <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-gay-general-20120811,0,5851176.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned</a> to their partners.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. Tammy Smith has pointed out that she understands the social significance of her promotion but would like to focus on “upholding Army values and the responsibility this carries.”</p>

<p>Smith’s father pinned one insignia on her epaulet before Smith’s wife Tracey placed the other.</p>
