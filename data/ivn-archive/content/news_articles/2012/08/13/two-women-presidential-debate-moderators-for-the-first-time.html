<p>The moderators for the presidential and vice-presidential debates have been&nbsp;announced, and for the first time in presidential debate history, two of the moderators will be women. The inclusion of a women as the 2012 presidential debate moderator will be the first time since 1992, when&nbsp;ABC’s Carole Simpson became the first woman (and African-America) to moderate a debate.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/commission_on_presidential_debates/index.html?inline=nyt-org" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="More articles about Commission on Presidential Debates">Commission on Presidential Debates</a>&nbsp;released this morning that the moderators will be&nbsp;Jim Lehrer&nbsp;of&nbsp;PBS, Bob Schieffer of CBS, Candy Crowley of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC will be the moderators. The New York Times reports,</p>

<p>This comes after the recent online petition from three high-school girls from New Jersey, which reached 170,000 signatures in favor of having a female moderator. In a statement prepared by one of the women behind the petition and presented by the <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/female-moderators-chosen-for-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>, Emma Axelrod spoke to the importance of having a female moderator:</p>
<blockquote><em>“Through this campaign, millions of Americans learned that two decades passed without a woman moderating a U.S. presidential debate,” she continued,&nbsp;“We are so proud to have helped educate Americans on this issue and are extremely happy that women and girls watching the debates this year will see a potential role model up on the stage moderating.”</em></blockquote>
<p>Again, the debates <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/07/25/presidential-debate-schedule-is-out/" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be</a> October 3, 11, 16, and 22. Will you be tuning in?</p>
