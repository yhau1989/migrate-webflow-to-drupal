<p>Tea party candidate Kerry Bentivolio won the GOP primary in Michigan's 11th District after trouncing a write-in challenge from party establishment pick, former state Sen. Nancy Cassis.</p>

<p>The story unfolding in Michigan's 11th District this summer is anything but normal. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter resigned on July 6th after <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20120808/NEWS06/308080104/Political-newcomer-wins-GOP-primary-battle-over-Cassis" rel="noopener noreferrer">failing to qualify</a> for the primary ballot. Massive discrepancies were found concerning his petition signatures, with as many as 85% rejected as invalid.</p>

<p>Enter Kerry Bentivolio, who up until July was under the radar as a spare Republican candidate in a pre-decided district. With Rep. McCotter's departure from the race, Bentivolio was left as the only GOP candidate on the ballot.</p>

<p>His biography is interesting, if not unconventional. Bentivolio has caught national attention as the "Santa Claus candidate", as he is a reindeer rancher and impersonates Santa Claus during holiday sleigh rides. He has no political experience. And then there is his appearance in a low-budget movie about the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/08/kerry-bentivolio-michigan-mccotter" rel="noopener noreferrer">9/11 conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Bentivolio is not who the Republican Party had in mind to replace Rep. McCotter. The GOP establishment attempted to address the vacuum with a run by former state Sen. Nancy Cassis as a self-funded write-in candidate, who at one point was outspending Bentivolio.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/08/02/4685938/freedomworks-pac-endorses-kerry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreedomWorks PAC</a>, Liberty for All, Rep. Justin Amash and Sen. Rand Paul <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/08/kerry-bentivolio-michigan-mccotter" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a> Kerry Bentivolio, and the whole game changed. Hundreds of thousands of dollars poured in on his behalf.</p>

<p>"Bentivolio is exactly the kind of representative America needs in Congress right now – a strong, common-sense advocate for liberty," said Max Pappas, Executive Director for FreedomWorks PAC, in a <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/08/02/4685938/freedomworks-pac-endorses-kerry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> last week. "As a dedicated citizen activist, Bentivolio had the conviction to take on an entrenched incumbent when no one else would."</p>

<p>While Tuesday's results will be seen as a victory for Bentivolio and his tea party supporters, the outcome may give Democrats an opportunity in a district that previously was uncompetitive. Recent redistricting actually made the district a safer Republican seat, says the Detroit Free Press.</p>

<p>Bentivolio will face off against Democrat Syed Taj in the general election.</p>

<p>If Tuesday night's results are any indication, Bentivolio and his helpful outside backers will stage quite a challenge.</p>

<p>“Together we won for the grass-roots and showing that principles matter,” Bentivolio said, according to Hometown Life.</p>
