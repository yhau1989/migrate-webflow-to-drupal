<p>As of July 2012, the United States combined public debt reached&nbsp;$15.93 trillion.&nbsp;We found this <a href="http://demonocracy.info/infographics/usa/us_debt/us_debt.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">visualization</a> to help put that number into&nbsp;perspective.</p>

<p>Of that number, around 50% is owned by foreign investors. China is the largest single holder of U.S. government debt, owning around $1.2 trillion in bills, notes, and bonds.</p>
<blockquote><em>In total, China owns about 8 percent of publicly held U.S. debt. Of all the holders of U.S. debt China is the third-largest, behind only the&nbsp;Social Security Trust Fund's holdings of nearly $3 trillion and the&nbsp;Federal Reserve's nearly $2 trillion holdings in Treasury investments, purchased as part of its&nbsp;quantitative easing&nbsp;program to boost the economy. - <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/moneymatters/ss/How-Much-US-Debt-Does-China-Own.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Government Info</a></em></blockquote>
