<p>Cheers! For the 27th year in a row, worldwide production of beer increased, says the <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_JAPAN_BEER_PRODUCTION?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>. A new report commissioned by Kirin Holdings, a Japanese brewery, said 50.9 billion gallons of beer were produced last year. That's a 3.7% increase from 2010.</p>

<p>Who is the leading beer producer worldwide?</p>

<p>Hint: It's not the countries who produce Heineken, Guinness, Fosters, or Bud Light.</p>

<p>Turns out the Chinese are the world's largest beer producers according to the report, reports <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_JAPAN_BEER_PRODUCTION?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" rel="noopener noreferrer">the AP</a>. China accounts for roughly 25% of world beer production.</p>

<p>The United States ranked second, followed by Brazil and Russia.</p>
