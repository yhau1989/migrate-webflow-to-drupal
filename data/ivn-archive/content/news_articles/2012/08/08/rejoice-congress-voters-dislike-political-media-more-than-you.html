<p>A new <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/31/1115407/-Daily-Kos-SEIU-State-of-the-Nation-poll-Everyone-agrees-the-political-media-sucks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Kos/SEIU poll</a> found one thing American voters apparently dislike more than Congress...the political media.</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>Q</strong>: In general, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the political media?</em>

<em></em><em>Favorable: 10</em>
<em> Unfavorable: 78</em>
<em> Not sure: 12</em></blockquote>
<p>For context, polls averaged by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/congressional_job_approval-903.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a> put congressional approval at just over 17%, with 76% disapproval. When President Nixon announced his resignation 38 years ago today, on August 8th, 1974, he had an <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval rating</a> of 24%.</p>

<p>Members of Congress can rest a little easier during their 5-week recess knowing that somewhere in American society, there exists a group more disliked than themselves.</p>
