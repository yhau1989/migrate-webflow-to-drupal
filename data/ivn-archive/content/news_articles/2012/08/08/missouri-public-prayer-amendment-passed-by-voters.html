<p><img alt="" height="222" src="cloudinary://missouri-amendment-2.jpeg" title="missouri amendment 2" width="600">Missouri's&nbsp;Amendment 2, placed on yesterday's primary election, also known as the Public Prayer Amendment, passed with overwhelming support yesterday. &nbsp;With just 2% of the vote tallied, the measure was declared to be successful with over 87% of the vote at current count. The vote today comes as a blessing to<a href="http://christiandiarist.com/2012/08/07/missouri-prayer-amendment-nears-passage/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> those on the christian right</a> that fear the secularization of America is threatening Christianity:</p>
<p><em>"The reason the measure almost certainly will be approved today is because Missouri’s Christian majority has decided it will no longer do nothing as the godless, the secularist, the non-sectarian wage unholy war against those who share the faith of this nation’s founders."</em></p>
<p>The official ballot title of the Public Prayer Amendment reads:</p>
<p><strong>Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to ensure:</strong></p>

<ul>
<ul>
	<li>That the right of Missouri citizens to express their religious beliefs shall not be infringed;</li>
	<li>That school children have the right to pray and acknowledge God voluntarily in their schools; and</li>
	<li>That all public schools shall display the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
