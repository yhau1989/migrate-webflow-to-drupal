<p>Who's got all the gold? &nbsp;Well its certainly not a little man in a funny green hat, but it looks like the rainbow is footed transcontinental with its ends surely planted in the United States and China. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.esri.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)</a> in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=city+of+redlands&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x80db53c64196b143:0x75d9e9ca3bdbba67,Redlands,+CA&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=O6oiUL2dO8bc2AWW04CQBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CJ8BELYD" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redlands, CA</a>&nbsp;has posted an interactive visualization that allows you to investigate the distribution of Olympic Medals (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) &nbsp;among the participating countries in this summer's London Olympics. &nbsp;ESRI is the developer of the proprietary industry software standard for digital cartographic analysis and visualization, ArcGIS.</p>

<p>The Map uses a feed from cloud server application platform,<a href="http://http://www.heroku.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> heroku.com</a>, that captures and feeds medal statistics into the map. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Cloud computing</a> has become a popular streamline service for business in the past couple years basically providing computing and storage as a online service. &nbsp;With the statistics being provided via cloud this visualization of the Olympic Medals operates smoothly and updates dynamically as the medals get reported to the feed from the London Olympics.</p>

<p>When you click on a country it will take you to that country's page on the 2012 London Olympics website. &nbsp;You can keep track of each country's Olympic Medals and read about recent wins all day. &nbsp;Keep updated and check back to watch that radius around your favorite country grow.</p>
