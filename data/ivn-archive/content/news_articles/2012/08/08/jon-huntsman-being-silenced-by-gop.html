<p>Rumors consistently circulate regarding how vocal opponents of partisanship within either party are quickly silenced or shunned. Jon Huntsman has become the latest victim of this behind-the-scenes suppression of dissent.</p>

<p>Abby Huntsman, daughter of Jon Huntsman, was interviewed last night on Current TV’s ‘The War Room’ and she disclosed an interesting bit about the RNC and their actions towards her father.</p>

<p>Apparently, right after Governor Huntsman ceased his campaign for the presidency, he was set to deliver a speech at a fundraiser in Florida for the RNC. Because he had been speaking on the need for a third party or voice, he was uninvited.</p>

<p>This is an interesting follow up to Jon Huntsman’s <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/07/08/john-huntsman-skipping-republican-nationalconvention/" rel="noopener noreferrer">refusal</a> to attend the Republican National Convention. When Governor Huntsman disclosed that he was not attending the Republican Convention he stated:</p>
<blockquote><em>I will not be attending this year’s convention, nor any Republican convention in the future, until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States – a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.</em></blockquote>
<p>It’s clear that both parties need to return to representing the people first. The moderate candidate never caught on during the Republican primary cycle although he likely represented the views of more Americans than Mitt Romney or Ron Paul.</p>

<p>With the Republican party moving further right and ostracizing moderate Republicans and moderate Independents, there is an opportunity for a third voice, party or non-party.</p>
