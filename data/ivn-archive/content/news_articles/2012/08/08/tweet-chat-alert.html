<p>Want to have a live discussion about solutions to political gridlock with us and <a href="nolabels.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Labels</a>? Well, tomorrow you can! We're holding our third ever tweet chat, this time looking&nbsp;for answers to the hyper-partisanship we see in government today.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong>&nbsp;Hyper-partisanship and gridlock in Washington.&nbsp;Members of Congress have failed to come together and compromise, while solution-making takes the back seat to partisan gridlock. Congressional approval ratings are at an all time low and American citizens are frustrated.</p>

<p><strong>The solution:</strong>&nbsp;That's where you come in! We want to come together, with the folks at No Labels, to have an open discussion&nbsp;about solutions to hyper-partisanship and Congressional gridlock.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> To start off the discussion, we'll be looking at No Labels' <a href="http://www.nolabels.org/work" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Ways to Make Congress Work</a> and <a href="http://www.nolabels.org/presidency-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">11 Ways to Make the Presidency Work</a>, but these are just ideas. We want to hear your thoughts and ideas about how get Washington back on track.</p>
