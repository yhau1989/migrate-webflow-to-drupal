<p>The US now has 50 GW of installed wind power, enough to power almost 13 million homes. Of course, all the turbines won't be generating at full power simultaneously so the amount of actual generated power will be less. Still, we are moving forward fast on wind power - except for offshore wind where the US, almost comically still does not have any offshore turbines.</p>

<p>The chart shows what 50 GW is. While calculating amounts of power generated by various sources is always complicated, I'm not sure where they got the nuclear and coal plant numbers. Some coal plants generate 2-3 GW, more than smaller nuclear plants.</p>
