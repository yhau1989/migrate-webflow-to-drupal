<p>Virgin America airline has teamed up with Rock the Vote and PromoJam Social Marketing to roll out a new "get out the vote" push on all Virgin America flights through November. Using a QR code to scan with smart phones, passengers will be directed to a mobile app that allows them to register to vote with Rock the Vote.</p>

<p>Flight passengers will be on their way to voting in their first election, all before wheels touch down.</p>

<p>â€œRock the Vote is thrilled to bring voter registration to Virgin America's guests as well as the opportunity to make a donation to support our efforts to register 1.5 million new voters and educate young Americans about participating in our democracy," said Heather Smith, President of Rock the Vote.</p>

<p>Rock the Vote registered over 2 million voters in 2008.</p>

<p>Virgin America airlines also announced today a new election-themed flight from San Francisco International Airport to Washington's Reagan National Airport, and had presidential impersonators on hand to celebrate.</p>

<p>The young airline is calling the campaign, "Both Sides of the Aisle Win".</p>
