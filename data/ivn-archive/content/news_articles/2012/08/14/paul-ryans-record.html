<p>Plenty of attention has been cast on Paul Ryan since word leaked on Twitter that he would be the next President of the United States, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTzssn6JQVQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">ugh next</a> Vice President of the United States. IVN contributors and journalists everywhere have peeled through his voting record, evaluated his positions, and speculated on the impacts of his budget proposal.</p>

<p>Aside from a Congressman’s voting record, we should look at the bills he has passed through Congress and have taken effect thanks to his efforts. In 13 years in Congress Paul Ryan’s record shows he has been responsible for two new laws.</p>

<p>In 2000 he <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr4241/text/ih" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> a law that renamed a post office in Janesville, WI to the ‘Les Aspin Post Office Building.’</p>

<p>4 election cycles later in 2008 he passed a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/12/paul-ryan-bills_n_1769816.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">law</a> that changed the way arrows used in bow hunting are taxed. Instead of the oppressive 12.4 percent tax levied against arrows, the new law charges a $0.39 tax on the sale of each arrow shaft.</p>

<p>The tax seemed to work well for the Congressman who is an avid bow hunter and member of the local <a href="http://janesvillebowmen.tripod.com/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Janesville</a> Bowmen in Wisconsin. Romney was quick to point out that the VP nominee is an avid outdoorsman, hoping to stir up support in the right’s hunting community.</p>

<p>Paul Ryan is the head of the House Budget Committee after drafting a budget proposal circulated in 2008 that has been adopted by the GOP. The budget would negatively effect just about everyone that isn’t making over $250,000 per year. It was also called a ‘Mistake of Historic Proportions’ by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/04/09/the-ryan-budget-a-mistake/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> contributor John T. Harvey.</p>

<p>Aside from his lack of <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/bills.php?cid=N00004357&amp;cycle=2008" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsorship</a> or passage of new laws in Congress and a budget that has not been implemented, the Congressman has risen in GOP ranks. He is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, the most powerful committee in the House. And is the current chair of the Budget Committee.</p>
