<p>In a lot of ways, school choice programs, though perceived as a draconian libertarian policy, are similar to the single-payer policy that many progressives want for health care. School choice doesn't mean leaving disadvantaged parents without a way to afford their children's education.</p>

<p>It means letting the government act as a single payer for education costs, but letting parents choose how to use that money to educate their child in a way that works best for them and their child instead of letting just a few government planners make those choices for everyone.</p>

<p>Watch below:</p>

<p>After watching the short video above, do you want a specific example of cost-cutting and educational improvement as a result of school choice? Look no further than <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/dc-vouchers-better-results-at-a-quarter-the-cost/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the federal government's own study</a> of its own school choice program-- the DC voucher program that Washington policymakers ended despite <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/whitehurst-duncan-is-not-lying/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitting on the results of this study</a>.</p>

<p>On a cost benefit basis, school choice programs deliver. They create better educational results at a lower cost. Why not implement them more, especially when education budgets are swallowing up the finances of so many states?</p>
