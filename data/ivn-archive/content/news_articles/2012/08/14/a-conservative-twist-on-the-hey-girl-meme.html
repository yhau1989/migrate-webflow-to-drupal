<p>Social media enthusiasts wasted no time this weekend, and jumped on the opportunity to spoof Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick Rep. Paul Ryan.&nbsp;Playing off of Ryan Gosling's "Hey Girl" meme, which melted hearts by pairing photos of <em>The Notebook</em> star Ryan Gosling with sensitive phrases, the internet community has created both a Twitter account and a Tumblr page dedicated to the Republican vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>While the Twitter account&nbsp;pokes fun at the politician, the Tumblr page <a href="http://heygirlitspaulryan.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hey Girl, It's Paul Ryan</a>&nbsp;seems to stay true to the original Gosling meme, paying homage to Paul Ryan's meticulously styled hair and piercing blue eyes. In true "Hey Girl" fashion, the Tumblr page hosts pictures of Paul Ryan with his family, close-ups of his eyes, and multiple shots of his exuberant smile.</p>
