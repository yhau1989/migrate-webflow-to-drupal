<p>The <a href="http://www.windpower.ltd.uk/Aerogenerator%20X%20Release%2026%2007%2010.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aerogenerator X</a> weighs considerably less than traditional wind turbines and the blades experience less fatigue. Their new version is half the weight and generates twice the power of the original design.</p>
