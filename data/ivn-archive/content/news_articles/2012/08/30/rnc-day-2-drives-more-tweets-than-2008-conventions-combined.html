<p>Rep. Paul Ryan made waves on Twitter last night, causing an outburst of tweets relating to the GOP convention upon accepting his Vice Presidential nomination, prompting more tweets than were sent during the entirety of both the Republican and Democratic conventions of 2008. Granted, the social network was novel back then, but&nbsp;peaking at 6,669 tweets per minute, Ryan drove more tweets than any speaker thus far.</p>

<p>In a blog post, Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/08/rnc-night-two-paul-ryan-takes-stage.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">shares</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>&nbsp;In fact, Tweets about the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gop2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GOP2012</a>&nbsp;convention topped two million as Ryan took the stageâ€”six times the Tweets sent about the 2008 conventions combined.</strong></em></blockquote>
<p>What appealed to viewers at home? There's a graph for that, thanks to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GooglePolitics/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Politics &amp; Election</a>:</p>
