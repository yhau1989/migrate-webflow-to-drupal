<p>In case you missed it, here's Paul Ryan's address to the Republican National Convention that had everyone talking. But just how much of it was true?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Politifact</a>, a&nbsp;news organization dedicated to measuring the accuracy of statements made by members of government on a "Truth-O-Meter", live-tweeted Paul Ryan's speech, revealing that while energizing, Ryan's speech was riddled with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0830/Paul-Ryan-s-factual-shortcuts-in-convention-speech" rel="noopener noreferrer">factual short-cuts</a>.</p>

<p>Politifact has also put together this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">profile</a> on Paul Ryan, measuring his tendencies to stick to the facts. It reportedly tracks his statements as borderline true, with 27% of his statements "Half True" and 27% of his statements "Mostly False". These numbers are relatively low when compared to Joe Biden, whose statements are generally either "True", "Mostly True", or "Half True".</p>
