<p>As an up-and-comer in the social media world, Google+ (Google Plus) made its convention debut this week, playing an integral role in the coverage of the 2012 Republican National Convention.&nbsp;Powered by the internet giant Google Inc., Google+ has integrated YouTube into it's social network, with Google Hangouts and YouTube live-streams available to everyone with Internet access.</p>

<p>Making its debut June 2011, the social network has grown at a steady pace, but has yet to reach numbers comparable to Twitter or Facebook. The network does, however, seem to be a favorite among politicians, with news outlets and politicians alike utilizing the features of Google Hangouts for this year's convention.</p>

<blockquote><em>It’s their opportunity to showcase Google Plus, a platform that has arguably become more popular with politicians than it is with average users.&nbsp;</em>

<em>The platform did not even exist during the last presidential cycle, but this year it will host convention-themed Google Hangouts, video chats with speakers, delegates, reporters and anyone else who stops by Google’s physical display areas at either convention.</em></blockquote>
<p>The<a href="https://plus.google.com/118169746660671764787/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Official Page of the Republican&nbsp;National&nbsp;Convention</a> in particular has done a spectacular job navigating the social network, streaming videos throughout the day, hosting Hangouts with reporters live on the scene, and posting live updates straight from Tampa, Florida.&nbsp;Other notable users of Google+ this election season include the&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/103778755977163571576/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PBSNewsHour/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">PBS NewsHour</a>, and the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+whitehouse/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House</a>.</p>
