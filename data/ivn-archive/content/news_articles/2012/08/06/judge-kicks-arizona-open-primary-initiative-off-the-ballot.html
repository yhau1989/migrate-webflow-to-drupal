<p>In a shocking turn of events and after millions of dollars being spent getting a top-two Arizona <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/06/04/california-open-primary-the-revolution-starts-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer">open primary</a> initiative on the ballot,&nbsp;Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Mark Brain <a href="http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/arizona/politics/article_447a996a-e001-11e1-897b-001a4bcf887a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicked the initiative off the ballot</a> for violating Arizona's 'single subject rule.' &nbsp;The initiative included provisions that would ban the use of public monies to fund party committee elections.</p>
<blockquote>"There is no good reason that a vote for or against that topic should be bundled with a vote on an open primary.'' - Judge Mark Brian

&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that the judge took the time to point out that he did not see any issues with regard to the top-two open primary issue itself. &nbsp;The sole issue before the court was whether the bill dealt with multiple issues; and it did.</p>
<p>IVN.us will be reporting on the Arizona Open Primary developing story in more detail tomorrow.</p>
