<p>Congressional partisanship is increasingly dividing lawmakers, policy debate is split along party lines, and the dissenting voice is diminishing in American politics.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;cause? The increasing tendency of lawmakers to vote along party lines, making the debate over issues one-dimensional. The moderate voice in Congress has all but&nbsp;disappeared, and between the years 1965-2004, the dissenting voice has been muted.</p>

<p>Ashley Joachim and Bryan Jones further <a href="http://prq.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/07/30/1065912912448930" rel="noopener noreferrer">explain</a>,</p>
