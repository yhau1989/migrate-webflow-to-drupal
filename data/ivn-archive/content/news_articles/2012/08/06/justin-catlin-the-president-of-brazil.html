<p><strong>Justin Catlin</strong>, won the 110-meter semis on Sunday at the Olympics in 9.82 seconds, posting a faster time in the semi-finals than Ursain Bolt.</p>

<p>When asked by an NBC reporter after his amazing race what it meant? Mr. Caitlin said, “It’s not about me it’s about America.”</p>

<p>Pay attention to those words, “It’s not about me it’s about America”, because those words were spoken by a black man.</p>

<p>The love that blacks have for our country, their sense of patriotism, given all that’s happened and continues to happen to African-Americans, never ceases to amaze me, and is a constant challenge to my own sense of patriotism.</p>

<p><strong>In 1970 a 22-year old woman</strong> belonging to an urban guerrilla organization in Brazil was captured. She was imprisoned, stripped of her clothing, hung upside down and tortured with electric shocks to her ears and feet.</p>

<p><strong>Her name: Dilma Rousseff, and today she's president of Brazil</strong>!</p>
