<p>Latino voters could swing election results this November, and the data revealing this are pretty dramatic. The Center for American Progress has a fascinating infographic with <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/07/latino_voters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the following commentary</a>&nbsp;on Latino voter influence on election results.</p>

<p>"<em>The infographic below highlights the top 10 states with the highest concentration of potential votersâ€”either eligible but unregistered Latino voters or green card holders that are eligible to become citizens and vote for the first time in November.* This infographic is the only place in which these two streams of potential voters have been compared side-by-side.</em></p>

<p><em></em><em>In 8 of the 10 states highlighted, the number of potential voters already outnumbers the margin by which either then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) or Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) won the state in 2008, in some cases far exceeding that margin.</em>"</p>
