<p>The Sac Bee's Torey Van Oot is on the ground in Tampa at the Republican National Convention, closely following the California delegation. She's been tweeting out photos of the scene on the convention floor, including California congressional candidate Ricky Gill. Gill is largely seen as a bright up-in-coming figure in California for conservatives and was featured heavily in youth and minority outreach programming at the CAGOP convention. He's running in Congressional District 9, against Rep. Jerry McNerney.</p>

<p>Gill was scheduled to speak today, but due to Tropical Storm Isaac his remarks have been rescheduled for Tuesday at 2:35pm EST.</p>
