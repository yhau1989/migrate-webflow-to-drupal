<p>The 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa has been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-08-26/GOP-revised-convention-schedule-speakers/57336304/1" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescheduled</a> due to Tropical Storm Isaac in the area. Originally slated to kick off today, party chairman Reince Priebus will instead call to order the festivities and immediately call a recess. Events and speeches planned for today are scheduled to resume Tuesday at 2pm.</p>

<p>Some notably established and rising-star Republicans are expected, such as Speaker John Boehner, Senator John McCain, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Senator Marco Rubio, and Governors Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal.</p>

<p>What perhaps is more telling are the people who are not speaking.</p>

<p>Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been omitted from the lineup, as well as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Representative Michele Bachmann, considered at one time a rising-star of the Tea Party movement, will also be excluded. Bachmann’s recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-michele-bachmanns-huma-abedin-accusations-continue-to-draw-criticism/2012/07/24/gJQAk87O7W_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">accusations against Huma Abedin</a>, aide to Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, as well as Cantor’s perceived&nbsp; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-michele-bachmanns-huma-abedin-accusations-continue-to-draw-criticism/2012/07/24/gJQAk87O7W_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">obstruction</a> in the debt ceiling debate last summer, appears to have made them too risky for this year’s lineup.</p>

<p>The two boldest choices for this year’s convention are outspoken New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who successfully staved off a recall election in June over his controversial <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/20/us-wisconsin-proposal-factbox-idUSTRE71J1RI20110220" rel="noopener noreferrer">union bill</a>. Senator Rand Paul, son of Texas congressman Ron Paul and self-described libertarian, is the closest thing to a third-party politician present. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn is the lone Democrat.</p>

<p>The glitz and glam that celebrities bring is also absent this year. Janine Turner and Beau Davidson are the only speakers from the entertainment industry – bolstering the small-town, anti-Hollywood, middle-America message established by the McCain-Palin camp last election season.</p>

<p>As is evidenced by his choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate, it remains to be seen whether this convention’s objective will be fulfilled: relinquishing conservative fears, dating back to the Republican primaries, of Mitt Romney’s ability to ignite the conservative base.</p>
