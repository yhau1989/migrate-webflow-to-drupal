<p>If the UK goes ahead with their <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120816/julian-assange-granted-asylum-ecuador" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat to storm the Ecuador embassy</a> in London, it will do so in complete and deliberate violation of international law. This would allow other countries to do the same, and make a mockery of the UK's pretension of supporting democracy and rule of law.</p>

<p>Assange has not been charged with any crimes in the UK or elsewhere. <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Will-Britain-s-Declaration-by-Ruth-Hull-120816-187.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some say</a> Britain taking this harsh stance due to pressure from the US.</p>
<blockquote>Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said that the Ecuadorian government had "received a written notice from British authorities that they would 'assault' the country's embassy in London if Ecuadorian authorities failed to hand over Assange to British authorities," CNN reported.

Patino added, "We are not a British colony. Those times are passed."</blockquote>
