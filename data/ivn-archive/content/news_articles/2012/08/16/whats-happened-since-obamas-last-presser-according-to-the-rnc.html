<p>The <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/08/16/white-house-press-corps-unhappy-with-obama-press-availability/" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House Press Corps</a>&nbsp;reporters aren't the only ones unhappy with Obama for his lack of cooperation with the press, as made evident in <a href="http://gop.com/news/gop-blog/a-lot-has-happened-since-obama-took-questions-from-the-wh-press/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list</a> posted Republican National Committee today. In the two months it's been since Obama took questions from the White House Press, a lot has happened, both politically and in pop culture. And thanks to the RNC, we can see exactly what's happened since Obama's last presser:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Obamacare had not been ruled on by the Supreme Court</li>
	<li>Obama had not used executive privilege to hide from Fast &amp; Furious</li>
	<li>The unemployment rate had not risen yet again to 8.3%</li>
	<li>Eric Holder had not been held in contempt of Congress</li>
	<li>The Obama SuperPac had not accused Mitt Romney of being responsible for a womanâ€™s death</li>
	<li>We did not know that all 3 Chiefs of Staff had been briefed on Solyndra and had an opportunity to advocate liquidation saving the taxpayers hundreds of millions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the world of pop culture, entertainment, and sports...</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Missy Franklin had 0 Olympic medals and nobody knew about the McKayla Maroney face</li>
	<li>The Mars Rover had not landed</li>
	<li>Ann Curry was still co-hosting Today</li>
	<li>Snoop Lion Was Still Snoop Dogg</li>
	<li>Kristen Stewart And Robert Pattinson Were Still Dating</li>
	<li>Lebron James had still not won an NBA Championship</li>
	<li>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were together</li>
	<li>Honey Boo Boo did not have a show on TLC</li>
	<li>A Spice Girls Reunion was still only a dream</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A good start, but what's missing from the list?</p>
