<p>Despite his success climbing the social ranks of Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, Rep. Paul Ryan has done little to boost Mitt Romney's numbers in the presidential tracking polls.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/156692/Romney-Sees-No-Immediate-Bounce-Ryan-Pick.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup survey</a>, Romney's numbers have seen an increase of 1 percentage point, an insignificant boost in terms of polling. Interestingly enough, Paul Ryan was the <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/08/15/social-stats-paul-ryan-vs-joe-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer">most talked about</a> politician on Facebook over the weekend, with his numbers far surpassing those of VP competitor Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Gallup does, however, point out the possibility of a delayed boost:</p>
<blockquote><em>While the initial indication is no increase in Romney's support after naming Ryan, the data suggest the possibility that Romney may get a delayed bounce, as he fared slightly better in Aug. 13-14 Gallup tracking than in Aug. 11-12 tracking.</em></blockquote>
<p>What does this say about social media? Contrary to the popular phrase "any press is good press," any social media mention is not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;a good social media mention, as the sentiment on social media channels was both positive and negative towards Paul Ryan. The analytical platform <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/paul-ryan-initial-reactions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Hexagon analyzed</a> the types of messages that were being sent out on Twitter in the days following Romney's announcement:</p>
<blockquote><em>In our analysis, we found that 55% of the conversation focused on sharing the news through mentions of the candidate (27%) or by publicizing the announcement (6%), yet others engaged through humor (22%). &nbsp;Echoing the tradition of political satirists from Mark Twain to Jon Stewart, we find that humor is a significant mode through which people engage and interact about politics and this highly-anticipated announcement via social media.</em></blockquote>

<p><strong>Moral of the story: Social media, while an invaluable tool for politicians and candidates alike, does not&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;results.&nbsp;</strong></p>
