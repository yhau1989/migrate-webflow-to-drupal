<blockquote>"I guess I really actually feel we&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;contort the voting process to accommodate the urban -- read African-American -- voter-turnout machine," Doug Priesse said in an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/08/19/fight-over-poll-hours-isnt-just-political.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">email to the&nbsp;<em>Columbus Dispatch</em>Sunday</a>. "Let's be fair and reasonable."</blockquote>
