<p>Are you ready for civil war? Tom Head, a judge in Lubbock County, Texas, says that is what Americans should expect if President Barack Obama is reelected.</p>

<p>“One of the things is he’s going to try to give the sovereignty of the United States away to the United Nations. What do you think the public is going to do when that happens? We are talking civil unrest, civil disobedience, possibly, possibly civil war, OK?” Judge Head remarked in an interview with <a href="http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/news/local/story/Lubbock-tom-head-tax-rates-president-obama/PeO4Q8GeGEiy_FpxheUnmA.cspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOX&nbsp; 34</a> in Lubbock.</p>

<p>Tom Head is not only a judge. He is an elected official in Texas. Voters in the state elect their judges from local to county to the high courts. He is implying that the President of the United States will overstep his authority to surrender our nation's sovereignty to the United Nations if he is reelected in November when there is no evidence to support such a claim.</p>

<p>He wasn't finished:</p>
<blockquote>Now what happens? What happens? Now I’m not talking just talking riots here and there. I’m talking Lexington, Concord, take up arms, get rid of the dictator. OK, what do you think he is going to do when that happens? He is going to call in the U.N. troops, personnel carriers, tanks and weapons.</blockquote>
<p>Judge Head is also the chairman of the county’s committee on emergency planning. According to <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/08/22/texas-judge-preparing-for-civil-war-if-obama-re-elected/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS DFW</a> in Texas, he is pushing tax increases for the district attorney’s office and the local Sheriff’s department. The revenue from the proposed tax hike would be used to “beef up”&nbsp; county resources in case Barack Obama wins reelection, violates the U.S. Constitution by ignoring separation of powers and checks and balances, and decides to plunge the country into civil war.</p>
<blockquote>And I’ve asked the sheriff. I said, ‘Are you going to back me on this?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I’m going to back you.’ Well, I don’t want a bunch of rookies back there who have no training and little equipment. I want seasoned veteran people who are trained that have got equipment. And even then, you know we may have two or three hundred deputies facing maybe a thousand U.N. troops. We may have to call out the militia.</blockquote>
<p>The absurdity of Judge Head’s claims is tantamount to the irresponsible and inexcusable nature of his words, especially from someone in his position of authority. He went on to say he was merely talking about the worst-case scenario. He added that it probably wouldn’t happen and yet he is willing to commit public resources to defend Lubbock County from an army of UN troops. Regardless of where one stands politically, it is unacceptable for a person in a position of influence to make such remarks.</p>

<p>It’s baseless, sensationalized rhetoric that distracts from serious debate. It takes the focus off real issues that matter to voters. Democrats and voters likely to vote for Barack Obama in November are angered by the comments, but at the same time it steers attention away from topics that could hurt the President’s chances at reelection.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that Tom Head will resign from the bench. Local Democrats will certainly demand that he step down, but the majority of voters in the county will not be troubled too much by his comments.</p>
