<p>The greatest benefit of an online election is convenience. The mechanism would make it easier to participate in elections and ensure that those in power represented a larger portion of the public. We will discuss how online elections would spark participation later in the series. Today we are focused on voter participation during presidential elections.</p>



<p>The last two presidential elections provide a measuring stick that we can use to evaluate voter turnout and voter fraud. Presidential election years historically have higher voter turnout than mid-term elections and should be compared to one another.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">[1]</a> Mid-term elections fluctuate in participation corresponding to ideological shifts in the American public.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">[2]</a></p>



<p>In 2008, 62.2% of eligible voters showed up at the polls. Five states had voter turnout percentages over 70%. In 2004, 60% of eligible voters turned out at the polls.<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">[3]</a> But, six states had voter turnout rates exceeding 70%.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">[4]</a> Minnesota was the national leader with 78% turnout in the general election.</p>



<p>Compared to the 2008 campaign, the 2004 turnout numbers looked more traditional. As did the ways the campaigns were conducted. Neither candidate built a reputation for effectively using the Internet as a mechanism for contacting voters, collecting donations, or delivering their positions on issues relevant to voters.</p>

<h2><em>Comparing the 2008 and 2004 Numbers</em><em></em></h2>

<p>There are some evident differences in the results between the two most recent presidential elections. The first is the 2% rise in voter turnout. Going one election further into the past, a 2% rise is relatively insignificant. During the 2000 presidential election only 55.4% of the eligible population participated in the election. <a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">[5]</a> Voter turnout being only half of the previous increase, between 2000 and 2004, still put the United States close to 2/3 national turnout.</p>
