<p>The United States is exceptional, but not for the reasons you may think.</p>

<p>It has been a year since I arrived in the United States and I thought it was time to make a summary of my impressions about this country. Americans pride themselves in their “American exceptionalism”. &nbsp;And I agree with that statement: the United States is “unusual, not typical” to take the Oxford dictionary definition of “exceptional”. But I don’t believe it is true because of the reasons usually advanced. I believe the United States is exceptional for their capacity to embody everything and its opposite and to an extent that I have not seen before. America is the country of the extremes, something that has baffled me more than once during this past year. And the recent “legitimate rape” <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/08/20/rnc-dismissal-of-adkins-legitimate-rape-remarks-a-game-changer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">scandal</a> is just a reminder to the world that the United States is capable of the best, but also the worst.</p>

<p>Here is a short list of reasons the United States is exceptional under my definition:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is a country that was one of the first western countries to legalize abortion broadly, but today is subject to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/womens-reproductive-rights_b_1345214.html?ref=fb&amp;src=sp&amp;comm_ref=false&amp;fb_source=message#sb=2972761,b=facebook" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing number of restrictions in numerous states.</a></li>
	<li>It is a country capable of sending a robot to Mars to study the habitability of the planet, but also has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/145286/Four-Americans-Believe-Strict-Creationism.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of the population</a>&nbsp;believing that man was made in its actual form by God 6,000 years ago.</li>
	<li>It is a country that has only one state with less than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/obesity-in-united-states-statistics_n_1313297.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/obesity-in-united-states-statistics_n_1313297.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">0% obesity, and an average of 30% obesity nationwide</a>,&nbsp;but is still able to win more medals than any other country in the 2012 Olympics.</li>
	<li>It is a country that until recently was the biggest polluter in the world (now ranked second), but in which<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 46% of American deny</a>&nbsp;that human activity is the reason for global warming.</li>
	<li>It is a country that has more nobel prizes than any other country, but whose Congress recently passed a law declaring tomato sauce on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45306416/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/t/pizza-vegetable-congress-says-yes/#.UDKNbN1mQf4" rel="noopener noreferrer">pizza a vegetable</a>.</li>
	<li>It is a country where the bottom <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/households-wealth-american-1-percent_n_1687015.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">50% of Americans own 1% of the country's wealth, while the top 1% owns 34.5% of it.</a></li>
	<li>It is a country that produces more porn than any other country in the world, but where most&nbsp;Hollywood&nbsp;actresses need to wear a bra while having sex.</li>
	<li>It is a country where &nbsp;within a one hundred mile radius, you can find both German baptist farmers who live a very&nbsp;ascetic lifestyle in the California Central Valley and clothes optional, hippie-style student cooperatives on the Berkeley campus.</li>
	<li>It is a country that holds the title of "World Most Powerful" country, but where you have a disproportionate number of presidential candidates that have no clue of foreign affairs.</li>
	<li>It is a country where you can drive at 16, vote, die for your country, and get a medical&nbsp;marijuana&nbsp;license at 18, but can only enjoy a cold beer when you are 21 (and with the exception of a few&nbsp;Muslim&nbsp;countries, the U.S. is the only country with such an age limit).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few highlights of extremes I have found while in the U.S., and I&nbsp;intentionally&nbsp;did not research the&nbsp;deeper&nbsp;reasons for each of these phenomenons, as my intention is to paint a general picture of how the United States can appear to an alien.</p>

<p>I will conclude by saying that I believe that the United States has the potential to do the worst and the best like no other country I have visited, and because of all the people that I have personally met, I trust that the U.S. can remain a source of greatness.</p>
