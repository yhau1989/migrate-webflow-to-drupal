<p>Lincoln Chafee, <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/12/10-facts-on-independent-governor-lincoln-chafee/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the only independent Governor</a> and former Republican Senator, will be attending the Democratic National Convention next month. As reported by <a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2012/08/16/chafee-to-attend-democratic-national-convention-next-month/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WPRI</a>, Chafee will be in Charlotte to nominate President Obama for a second term. Chafee has a complex political history, and after leaving the GOP, served as a national co-chair of Obama's re-election campaign.</p>

<p>Chafee, who was first introduced to politics by his father in 1964, left the Republican party in 2004, after attending his last Republican National Convention. Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/08/exgop-senator-to-attend-dem-convention-132401.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that while his appearance won't be a surprise, Democrats will take advantage of his independence from the two parties:</p>
<blockquote><em>But you can bet that as a prominent ex-Republican, Democrats will be hyping Chafeeâ€™s appearance as evidence of their claims that Obama has sought to work across party lines but the GOP has taken a hard turn to the right.</em></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Does Chafee's attendance at the DNC reflect the president's efforts to work across party lines?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
