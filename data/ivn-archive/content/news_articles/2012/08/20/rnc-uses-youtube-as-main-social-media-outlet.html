<p>The Republican National Convention has made known this year’s main social media strategy: YouTube. Calling their approach the “Convention Without Walls”, the happenings to occur in Tampa, Florida will be live-streamed on the social media site with intentions to “provide a place for delegates and attendees to share and interact with one another and with the outside world,” says Communications Director James Davis. The director says that YouTube will be the “central point of activity” with Facebook, Twitter, as well as Google+ coming in at second.</p>

<p>This new approach and first ever social media delve into YouTube by the convention has received overall approval by the main GOP presidential candidate and his team. Zac Moffatt, Mitt Romney’s digital director says that “What they’ve come up with is pretty awesome... [This convention] is the first time technology has given us the platform to bring the convention outside the halls [in Tampa]”.</p>
