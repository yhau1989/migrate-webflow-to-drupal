<p>As one of the most popular blogging sites to date, Tumblr will be sending off it's very own bloggers to cover both the Republican and Democratic conventions, to be posted on their new election page <a href="http://election.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tumbling the Conventions</a>.</p>

<p>Already hard at work, the Tumblr page is populated with maps, images, videos, and of course, <a href="http://cognitivedissonance.tumblr.com/post/29282111184/romney-campaign-examined-tax-returns-of-potential-veeps" rel="noopener noreferrer">memes</a>, giving viewers an inside look at what's to come in the following weeks. Browsing through recent posts, two things become evident: 1) the bloggers at Tumblr have a great sense of humor, and 2) memes will rule the 2012 election.</p>

<p>In a recent post, the staff wrote:</p>
<blockquote><em>Tumblr will be on the ground with them. With 77 days to go until election day here in the US, today weâ€™re kicking off a host of opportunities for you to follow the developments and get behind the scenes of the political process.</em>

<em>Six Tumblr bloggers will have the chance to experience the conventions first-hand. Follow<a href="http://election.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">election.tumblr.com</a>&nbsp;for their exclusive coverage of the sights, sounds, personalities, protests, politics, and parties in Tampa and Charlotte.</em></blockquote>
<p>To follow along in the Tumblrverse,&nbsp;the official tag of the election will be <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/election-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">Election 2012</a>.</p>
