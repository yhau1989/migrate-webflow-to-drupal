<p>The <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/wikiwep" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki Weapon Project</a> is raising money on the net to create open source 3D printing of weapons using technology available now. What changes everything is that all that is needed to 3D print a gun is the CAD file, which can be shared on the internet, and a 3D printer. Even more mind boggling, 3D printers are on the verge of being able to replicate themselves.</p>

<p>This means gun control, patents, and border controls become relic of the pasts, says the video, with the kleptocrats unable to control things nearly as much as before. This may not be hyperbole. 3D printing really does change everything.</p>
