<p>Here's an interesting graphic from&nbsp;<a href="www.brandignity.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandignity</a>&nbsp;on the psychology of social networking.</p>

<p>Some highlights of the infographic:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Nine out of ten US internet users are on a social network.&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>One out of five minutes spent online is on a social network and that number is only increasing with time.&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Although 80% of social media posts are about the poster, 9 out of 10 people think we share too much.&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Facebook allows you to pay for your status update to be highlighted.</em></li>
	<li><em>Talking about ourselves is associated with the same satisfaction we get from food, money or sex.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It ends with a question to think about while youâ€™re posting your new status update on Facebook: Are we obsessed with social media or are we obsessed with ourselves?&nbsp;</strong></p>
