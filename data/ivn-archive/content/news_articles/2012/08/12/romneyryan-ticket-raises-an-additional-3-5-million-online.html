<p>Add that to the $101 million he raised in the month of July (passing Obama by a good <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/06/obama-raises-75-million-in-july-outpaced-by-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$25 million</a>), and you've got what looks to be the most expensive election in history.</p>

<p>Democrats have been doing their own fundraising, using Romney's pick of Rep. Paul Ryan to rake in the campaign cash. The Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/243203-house-dems-fundraise-off-of-ryan-choice" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>House Democrats waited about an hour after the presumptive GOP nominee officially chose Ryan to fire off a fundraising email, and quickly followed that up by sending releases to dozens of House Republican districts.</em></blockquote>
<p>In one such email, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Robby Mook, called Paul Ryan “the architect of the Republican plan to kill Medicare.”</p>

<p>And where is all this money going? TV ad buys have been the largest expenditure of this presidential campaign, with a total of $269.9 million spent on TV ads thus far, according to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidential-campaign-ads-2012/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>. And if you're just tuning in now, almost three-quarters of those ads have been blatantly negative.</p>
