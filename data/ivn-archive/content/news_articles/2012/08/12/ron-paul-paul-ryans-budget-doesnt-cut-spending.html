<p>Earlier this year, with the republican primary still wide open and Paul Ryan's budget in the news, presidential candidate Ron Paul, another Congressman known for his fiscal conservatism and limited government philosophy, told Neil Cavuto that Paul Ryan's budget "doesn't cut anything of substance" out of the exploding federal budget, and merely aims to contain its growth and "maybe balance the federal budget in thirty years."</p>

<p>Cavuto agrees and points out that even under the best economic and fiscal assumptions, Paul Ryan's plan still adds $4 trillion to the national debt over the next ten years.</p>
