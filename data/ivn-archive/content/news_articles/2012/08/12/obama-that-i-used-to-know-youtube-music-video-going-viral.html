<p>In just 8 days, a video by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JustNewProductions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JustNewProductions</a>, who has never posted any other videos on YouTube, has received over 600,000 views on a music video called, "Obama that I used to Know." The video is a "parody" of Gotye's popular song, "Somebody that I Used to Know."&nbsp;The message is particularly directed at young voters who are don't believe Obama brought the change he promised. Young voters are the fastest growing segment of non-partisan voters.</p>

<p>The video is perfect example of how fast and how far a message can spread on the internet, even when it originates from a user account without a prior following. With respect to the political impact of the video, the message of the video is important. This is not a pro-Romney ad. And it definately is not a pro-Obama ad. &nbsp;Though it may help Romney by turning voters away from Obama.</p>
<blockquote>"But the change I got is that I moved in with my mother? ... Your speeches never soar as high as unemployment ...you left me like a dog strapped on Romney's car."</blockquote>
