<p>Renault tested their Zoe electric vehicle in -13 degree weather in Finland and found "a<a href="http://green.autoblog.com/2012/08/24/renault-says-zoe-performance-changes-almost-unnoticeable-in-co/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lmost unnoticeable</a>" differences in performance and battery range, something which can be a problem with other electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Extremely hot weather can also be problematic for EVs, as N<a href="http://www.hybridcars.com/news/nissan-leaf-owners-hope-best-fear-worst-50263.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">issan Leaf</a> owners are discovering in Phoenix, where vehicle range has apparently been severely reduced by the heat, which is routinely well over 100 in the summer.</p>
