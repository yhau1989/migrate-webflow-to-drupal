<p>The GOP has postponed the first day of events for the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa due to the threat of Tropical Storm Isaac. The convention will still officially begin on Monday with a cerimonial "gaveling," but the actual events will be postponed until Tuesday.</p>
<blockquote>Due to the severe weather reports for the Tampa Bay area, the Republican National Convention will convene on Monday, Aug. 27 and immediately recess until Tuesday afternoon, Aug. 28, exact time to follow.

Our first priority is ensuring the safety of delegates, alternates, guests, members of the media attending the Republican National Convention, and citizens of the Tampa Bay area. RNC Convention officials and the Romney campaign are working closely with state, local and federal officials, as well as the Secret Service, to monitor Tropical Storm Isaac and preserve Florida's emergency management resources. Officials have predicted participants may encounter severe transportation difficulties due to sustained wind and rain.</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Ron Paul's "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEmDu1AYA4o" rel="noopener noreferrer">We are the Future</a>" rally has drawn thousands of his supporters to the&nbsp;USF Sun Dome in Tampa. The day's events are being&nbsp;broadcast&nbsp;live and have featured guests like Lew Rockwell, Walter Block, and Master of Ceremonies Doug Weed. Ron Paul is scheduled to speak at 4pm EST.</p>
