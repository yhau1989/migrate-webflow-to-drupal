<p>Sunday morning, around 25 were injured in a shooting that&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee. The number comes from Parminder Kaleka, whose brother-in-law was in the Sikh Temple, and used his cell phone to <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">speak to her</a> while inside the temple.</p>

<p>The Associated Press <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-shootings-at-sikh-temple-near-milwaukee-20120805,0,936719.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:</p>
