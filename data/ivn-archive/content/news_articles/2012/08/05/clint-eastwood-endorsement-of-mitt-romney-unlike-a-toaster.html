<p><img alt="" height="337" src="cloudinary://CLint-Eastwood-Guarantee-Toaster.jpeg" title="CLint Eastwood Guarantee Toaster" width="600">As we all get caught up in political hype and emotional over-analysis of every tweet and celebrity statement, the Clint Eastwood endorsement of Mitt Romney today proves that <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/105312.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pundits</a> should think twice about regurgitating the insights of other <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/07/clint-eastwood-chrysler-super-bowl-ad-shows-obama-messaging-is-weak.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pundits</a>, just because they are <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72501.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pundits</a>. During the super bowl, Clint Eastwood narrated a commercial for Chrysler, and all the buzz was that he was&nbsp;<em>de facto</em> making an endorsement of Obama in supporting America's auto industry.</p>
<blockquote>"I said, God, this guy, he's too handsome to be governor, but he does look like he could be president," Eastwood joked. "As the years have gone by I began to think even more so about that."</blockquote>
<p>Well, Clint Eastwood is a notorious Republican endorser, and has called himself more of a <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/news/last_word/2011/09/clint-eastwood-chimes-in-with.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">social libertarian</a>, a bit of a disassociation with the christian Chick-fil-a right wing of the party. With Obama's support of gay marriage and the Rick Santorum faction still rearing its head as a major player in the Republican party, Clint Eastwood's endorsement of Mitt Romney should put the rumors to rest.</p>

<p>My two sense, the Clint Eastwood Eastwood endorsement just made Mitt Romney's day. So next time a pundit makes a grand statement&nbsp;likening&nbsp;the narration of a commercial to an endorsement of a candidate, because a particular candidate will most likely benefit from the commercial, think twice. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100514/quotes" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you want a&nbsp;guarantee, by a toaster.</a></p>
