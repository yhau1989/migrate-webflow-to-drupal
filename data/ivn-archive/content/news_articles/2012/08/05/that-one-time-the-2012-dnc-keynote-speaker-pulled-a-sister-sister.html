<p>The Democratic party announced their line up of speakers for the 2012 Democratic National Convention this week, which is shaping up to be quite a show. Among those scheduled to speak is San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. The young mayor will deliver the DNC's keynote address, a coveted honor once bestowed upon rising party star Senator Barack Obama back in 2004.</p>

<p>Politico compiled an interesting "<a href="http://www.politico.com/gallery/2012/07/10-key-facts-about-julian-castro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 key facts about Julian Castro</a>" for those looking to learn more about this Texan mayor.</p>

<p>One of the most intriguing finds? Castro, who has an identical brother, may have pulled a <em>"Sister, Sister"</em> when it came to a local parade.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p><em>Sister, Sister</em> was a popular Disney show in the 90's starring twins Tia and Tamara Mowry. In multiple episodes and instances, the sisters attempt a switcheroo where one sister stands in for another.</p>

<p>According to critics, Castro may have done just that during a 2005 San Antonio parade.</p>

<p>As the <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/stories/050705/sta_0507050092.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><em>Castro made national headlines recently when his twin brother, State Rep. Joaquin Castro, took his place in the city council's parade float. Opposing mayoral candidates accused the brothers of trying to deceive parade watchers, who mistook the stand-in for the candidate.</em>

<em>Julian Castro said he had a conflicting event but didn't intend to trick anyone.</em></blockquote>
<p>Depending on your point of view, you may find this dismaying, or pretty awesome. I know there are multiple times in life where I've wished I had an identical twin to stand in for me. Actually going through with it, as an elected official takes quite a bit of guts...</p>

<p>The 2012 Democratic National Convention will take place September 3-6th in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mayor Castro is scheduled to speak on September 4th.</p>
