<p>Moody's says more California municipal bankruptcies are coming, as well as bond defaults.</p>
<blockquote>Moody's floated the idea Friday of an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/moodys-municipal-bankruptcy-california-2012-8" rel="noopener noreferrer">across-the-board ratings adjustment for Californi</a>a cities, a move the [executive director of the League of California Cities] warned "would have a terrible impact on taxpayers."</blockquote>
<p>Indeed it would. If California's bond ratings are lowered, then the cost of borrowing money will increase for California cities and probably also for counties, school districts, and the state itself.</p>
