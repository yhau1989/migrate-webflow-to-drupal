<p>Craig Murray is a former UK diplomat who was fired after going public with reports about torture and brutal suppression in Uzbekistan. He is a well-lknown activist in Britain now. He blogged this morning of his disgust with the British threat of raiding the Ecuador Embassy in London to get Assange. His site immediately went down with a Denial of Service attack. This happens routinely when he posts against the government.</p>

<p>Bloggers have <a href="http://pastie.org/4521037" rel="noopener noreferrer">crossposted</a> <a href="http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">what he said</a> and his blog is up (for now.)</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>This will be, beyond any argument, a blatant breach of the Vienna Convention of 1961, to which the UK is one of the original parties and which encodes the centuries – arguably millennia – of practice which have enabled diplomatic relations to function. The Vienna Convention is the most subscribed single international treaty in the world.

I hope to have more information soon on the threats used by the US administration.</blockquote>
