<p>Taking a page out of the old Ron Paul playbook, <a href="http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson has announced</a> that he has raised over $250,000 from over 3,000 different supporters in his campaign's latest "money bomb." For those not familiar with the term "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneybomb" rel="noopener noreferrer">money bomb</a>," it refers to a short-term fundraising campaign targeted at small dollar donors in mass numbers. Ron Paul's 2008 Presidential campaign was the first campaign to coin the term and run such a successful campaign. &nbsp;On November 5th and December 16th of 2007, the Paul campaign hauled in over $<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd1kLATVljY" rel="noopener noreferrer">4.2 million</a> and over $6&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KCrvxZAsO8" rel="noopener noreferrer">million</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>With little media exposure and less household name ID, the "money-bomb" is a powerful tool that could keep the Johnson campaign ticking, despite the billions of dollars in the war chests of the two major candidates. As Johnson and his supporters put increasing <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/17/gary-johnson-supporters-protest-media-blackout-across-nation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pressure on CNN</a> and the major media outlets to include him in the debates, will this ability to raise money online provide the resources they need to get him on stage?</p>
