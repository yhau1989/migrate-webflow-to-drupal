<p>And check out <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/03/porn-star-jenna-jameson-backs-romney-when-youre-rich-you-want-a-republican/" rel="noopener noreferrer">her reason why</a>:</p>
<blockquote>'A woman who was once considered to be the world’s most famous pornographic actress on Thursday endorsed presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at a strip club in California.

During an appearance at San Francisco’s Gold Club, “Queen of Porn” Jenna Jameson told WTSP that Romney was her guy.

“<strong>I’m very looking forward to a Republican being back in office,” Jameson said. ” “When you’re rich, you want a Republican in office.</strong>” [bold font added for emphasis]'</blockquote>
<p>See, this was too good to pass up blogging. Jameson's quip about being rich and wanting a Republican is so funny that I can't help but wonder if the entire endorsement is supposed to be an ironic jab at the Wall Street banker that Republicans have chosen to run for president this year (mixed in with a dash of self deprecation and a heaping helping of publicity-seeking).</p>

<p>Still, as delighted as I was by the dig, intentional or not, at both Mitt Romney and the Republican Party, I've got to say that it's only half true. Spend enough time browsing through the data on political donations (one fantastic resource for this is <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Secrets</a>), and it shouldn't be hard to conclude that when you're rich, you want a Republican <strong>or a Democrat</strong> in office. Doesn't make a big difference either way.</p>

<p>Big corporations, well-funded Super Pacs, Wall Street bankers, multi-national conglomerates, the military-industrial complex-- they give millions of dollars to help both Republicans and Democrats get elected. It's a great return on investment for them too. It's not hard to see why you'd like the two-party establishment's lawmakers if you're rich. It seems to me that on the whole, federal public policy (which is dominated by the two main parties, and that includes the Democrats) is unambiguously pro-"entrenched wealthy establishment."</p>

<p>So being rich shouldn't necessarily make you prefer either party's candidate for president. In some cases, with some companies and industries, and some candidates, it might make sense for the rich to side with one, but I'd have to say that in Jenna Jameson's case, if you're rich because of your work in the porn industry, you definitely <em>do not</em> want a Republican in office.</p>

<p>I wonder if she knows about Mitt Romney's 2007 promise to federally mandate (I thought he only liked mandates on a state level) that "every new computer sold in this country after I’m president has installed on it a filter to block all pornography, and that parents can click that filter to make sure their kids don’t see that kind of stuff coming in on their computer." Yes that was Mitt Romney, not Rick Santorum.</p>

<p>Someone needs to tell Romney that parents can already block websites using any number of different tools and functionalities created by the tech companies that make their computers, write their software, and provide their Internet service. Christian groups have also created downloadable Internet filters that parents can find online without any help from Congress. There's no need for a federal law micromanaging the way advanced information technology companies design their products. Good grief.</p>

<p>And now your moment of Zen: the video in which Mitt Romney makes the aforementioned promise. Wait until the last three seconds of the clip for the side-splittingly funny lukewarm response Romney's promise elicits from a college aged boy in the audience:</p>
