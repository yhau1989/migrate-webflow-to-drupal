<p>Undecided voters are of course getting quite a bit of ink this election cycle, as both parties target their support.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/10-questions-for-an-undecided-voter-in-ohio/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> had a chat with an independent voter in Ohio.</p>
<blockquote><em>I don’t see either party giving me any benefits whatsoever in my life, because there’s such a deadlock. They’re equally to blame. You’ve got Congress and the Senate and the Republicans and the Democrats — they’re not going to meet in the middle. They don’t care about the middle-class person. They’ve got all the lobbyists in their back pocket. We elect them, but they don’t listen to us.</em></blockquote>
