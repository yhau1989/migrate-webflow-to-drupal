<h5>Mass Shootings in 2012: A Google Map Perspective</h5>
<p>Following the shooting attack in Wisconsin and last month's massacre in Colorado, I felt it would be interesting to show how many shootings have been deemed significant by the press or by other gun safety advocates using a Google Map. A quick Google search revealed a report compiled by the largest gun control advocates in the county, <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Brady Campaign for Gun Violence</a>. &nbsp;The report&nbsp;lists all of the "<a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/pdf/major-shootings.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass Shootings Since 2005</a>" and gives excerpts from popular articles released by various news sources at the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>The Brady Campaign was started by former Assistant to the President and White House Press Secretary, James Brady, who was permanently disabled and nearly killed as a result of the assassination attempt on former President Reagan in 1981. The Brady Campaign is a non-profit political organization dedicated to preventing gun violence through policy change.</p>

<p>Using a simplified map design and database tool called <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Fusion Tables</a>, I complied the information and assigned marker icons appropriate to the type of location of each shooting. There are 25 markers on the map, representing each shooting that&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;in 2012.</p>
