<p><em>1. Because you're tired of Congressional Gridlock. </em></p>

<p>If your like the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/congressional_job_approval-903.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">76.2%</a> of Americans who disapprove of Congress, you're probably a little frustrated at the partisan bickering that's prevented the 112th Congress from getting much of anything done. What's more, they are now on a 5 week vacation, giving you even more reason to join the discussion.</p>

<p><em>2. Because you're tired of complaining. </em></p>

<p>We've tweeted, Facebooked, texted, even screamed our complaints about Congress and the current state of Washington, but it seems as if no one is listening. Let's move beyond these complaints and come together as a community to discuss real policy options.</p>

<p><em>3. Because it's with No Labels.</em></p>

<p>And they've put out some awesome ideas on how to solve the polarization we see in politics today. Check them out <a href="http://www.nolabels.org/work" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="http://www.nolabels.org/presidency-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/13/no-budget-no-pay-no-labels/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>4. Because you're already on Twitter. </em></p>

<p>Come on, we know that if you're an active Twitter user, you're probably going to turn to Twitter at some point today. Make an effort to take your "Twitter Break" at 11am PST, 2pm EST to share your thoughts with us and your followers.</p>

<p><em>5. Because it will be fun. </em></p>

<p>Need proof? Check out the highlights of our last two tweet chats <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/29/independent-candidates-engage-via-twitter-indyvote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/15/speak-4yourself-a-recap-of-ivns-first-tweetchat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>So I guess it's settled. See you on <a href="https://twitter.com/IVNetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>!</p>
