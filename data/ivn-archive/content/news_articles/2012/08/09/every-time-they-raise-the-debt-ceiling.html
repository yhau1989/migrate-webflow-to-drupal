<p>I think of this game every time they raise the debt ceiling:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="402" src="cloudinary://jenga.png" title="jenga" width="467"></p>

<p>...and every time they pass a new appropriation without having the revenue to pay for it (which is currently every time they pass a new appropriation), every time there's a new round of monetary "easing," every time we get involved in a new country's conflict, and pretty much every time Congress is in session.</p>

<p>Is it just me?</p>
