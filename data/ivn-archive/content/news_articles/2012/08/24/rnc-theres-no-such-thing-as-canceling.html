<p>Facing threats from Hurricane Isaac, there has been much speculation over whether or not the Republican National Convention, set to start early next week, will be able to take place due to the weather conditions in Tampa, Florida.</p>

<p>When asked about the possibile impacts of the hurricane, RNC communications director Sean Spicer <a href="http://thehill.com/video/campaign/244891-rnc-to-hold-convention-through-hurricane-forecasts-theres-no-such-thing-as-canceling" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on CNN, "There's n such thing as&nbsp;canceling." Spicer continued,</p>
<blockquote><em>"We do have contingency plans to deal with weather-related and other circumstances that may occur to ensure that ... the business can go on at the RNC and that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will become our nominees and that the safety of the folks attending it here and in the Tampa Bay community are taken care of."&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>Tampa will also host Ron Paul's festival, the <a href="http://paulfestival.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">P.A.U.L. Festival</a>, this weekend, with delegates and fervent supporters taking to the streets to voice their political views. <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/13307/ron-paul-at-the-rnc-forget-hurricane-isaac-hurricane-paul-is-the-real-storm-that-is-brewing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Policymic asks</a>, should the RNC be more worried about Hurricane Paul?</p>
