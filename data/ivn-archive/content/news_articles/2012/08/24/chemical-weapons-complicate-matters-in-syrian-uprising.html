<p>President Obama warned Syria's government earlier in the week that the use of chemical or biological weapons in the nation’s escalating civil conflict against the Syrian uprising might illicit a US military response. The president called the use of such weapons a “red-line” with “enormous consequences.”</p>

<p>Syrian foreign ministry spokesperson Jihad Makdissi confirmed that Syria possessed chemical and biological weapons in July when responding to international concerns that the country’s stockpile could fall into terrorist hands. Speaking on <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57477621/syria-says-chemical-or-biological-weapons-could-be-used-if-there-is-external-aggression/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Syria says chemical or biological weapons could be used if there is &quot;external aggression&quot;">Syrian state television</a> in July, Makdissi said:</p>
<blockquote>"All of these types of weapons are in storage and under security and the direct supervision of the Syrian armed forces and will never be used unless Syria is exposed to external aggression."</blockquote>
<p>The Syrian uprising began in the southwestern city of <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-casbah/the-graffiti-launched-revolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="How schoolboys began the Syrian revolution">Darraa</a> near the Jordanian border in March 2011 when officials arrested several children for writing anti-government graffiti at school. Protesters opposing the arrests demanded reforms and decried government corruption. Government soldiers fired on the demonstrators, which resulted in four deaths. Since then violence in Syria has escalated into daily battles between government forces and rebel militias.</p>

<p>In Monday’s impromptu <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/20/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE8610SH20120820" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Obama warns Assad U.S. could act">White House press brief</a>, President Obama told reporters that the use of biological and chemical weapons remained a concern to both the US and the NATO alliance:</p>
<blockquote>"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus."</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/14/u-s-military-completes-planning-for-syria/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="U.S. military completes initial planning for Syria">CNN reported</a> that Pentagon planners completed a preliminary blueprint for military intervention in Syria in June. The news outlet reported that military officials cited civil war, sectarian violence, humanitarian aid, and the securing of weapons of mass destruction as major military concerns.</p>

<p>Media reports over the last decade have speculated that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein transferred WMD to Syria. Iraqi Air Force general under Hussein, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182932,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Exclusive! Former Top Military Aide to Saddam Reveals Dictator's Secret Plans  Read more: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182932,00.html#ixzz24RhU3PWQ">Georges Sada</a> claimed in a 2006 book that the Iraqi leader moved WMD to Syria on the eve of the 2003 invasion, while the Israeli newspaper <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/what-is-assad-hiding-in-his-backyard-1.292935" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="What is Assad hiding in his backyard? Satellite photos of secret Syrian site depict at least five guarded installations whose purpose is unclear.">Ha’aretz</a> released high altitude photos of suspected Syrian chemical weapons sites in 2010. However, a fact-finding mission by the multinational <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/25/AR2005042501554.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Report Finds No Evidence Syria Hid Iraqi Arms">Iraqi Survey Group</a> concluded that Iraqi WMD did not end up in Syria.</p>

<p>The situation in Syria continues to complicate relations between the United States and the Russian Federation. The Syrian government remains host to the Russian navy in the port city of Tartus where Russia has operated a supply and maintenance installation since 1971. Russia also maintains an extensive arms trade with the Assad government.</p>

<p>Secretary of State <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-12/russia-sending-attack-helicopters-to-syria-clinton-says.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Russia Sending Attack Helicopters To Syria, Clinton Says">Hillary Clinton</a> accused Russia of sending attack helicopters to aid the Syrian government In June:</p>
<blockquote>"We are concerned about the latest information we have that there are attack helicopters on the way from Russia to Syria, which will escalate the conflict quite dramatically."</blockquote>
<p>Russia insisted that the hardware was moved<a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120624/174216985.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Lavrov Dismisses Claims of New Helicopter Shipments to Syria"> under a contract</a> signed in 2008 for overhaul in the Middle-Eastern nation. Speaking on the helicopters, Russian Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9329366/Russia-accuses-US-of-arming-Syrian-rebels.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Russia accuses US of arming Syrian rebels">Sergei Lavrov</a> accused the United States of supporting the rebels:</p>
<blockquote>"That contrasts with what the United States is doing with the opposition, which is providing arms to the Syrian opposition which are being used against the Syrian government."</blockquote>
<p>However, the United States and Russia remain in agreement that the Syrian government should not secure chemical and biological weapons from terrorists groups.</p>

<p>Russian Deputy Foreign Minister <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/russia-confident-syria-not-chemical-weapons-report-081232752.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Russia confident Syria will not use chemical weapons: report">Gennady Gatilov</a> told reporters on Thursday that the Syrian government assured Russian officials that Damascus will not allow weapons to fall in to terrorist hands:</p>
<blockquote>“We were assured a very strict control is exercised over the security of the chemical weapons storage and that there is no danger the situation might fall out of control.”</blockquote>
<p>The situation in Syria also complicates the antagonistic relationship between Iran and the West. Western diplomats have repeatedly accused Iran of aiding the Assad government. <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0823/1224322766194.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Arming Syria: UN claims Iran link">The Irish Times</a> reports that a UN investigation has implicated Iran in illegally providing support to Syria.</p>
