<p>Angus King, former independent governor of Maine in 1994 and 1998 is running for senate as an independent in November. King has gotten a lot of media atention so far, what other independent governors are we overlooking?</p>

<p>Illinois Maine Minnesota Oregon Rhode Island and Texas have all had formally elected independent governors.</p>

<p>In 1974, Illinois elected its first two governors, Shadrach Bond and Edward Coles, both independents.</p>

<p>Besides Angus King, Maine elected independent James B Longley in 1974.</p>

<p>Jesse Ventura of Minnesota ran as a member of the Reform Party, which later reverted back to their original tittle, the Independence Part of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Oregon elected Julius Meier, an independent Governor all the way back in 1930 and Rhode Island elected an independent govenor most recently in 2010, Lincoln Chafee.</p>

<p>Texas takes the cake for oldest elected independent governor- Sam Houston (last name sound familiar?) was elected in 1859, unafiliated with any party.</p>
