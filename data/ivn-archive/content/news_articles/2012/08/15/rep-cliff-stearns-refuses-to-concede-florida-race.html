<p><strong>UPDATE: The Associated Press is now reporting Rep. Cliff Stearns has conceded to Ted Yoho in Florida's 3rd congressional district.</strong></p>

<p>A surprise upset in Florida's primary election has Republican Congressman Cliff Stearns trailing political unknown Ted Yoho by 829 votes, but refusing to concede the race.</p>

<p>63,690 votes were tallied in total.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/politics/2012-08-14/story/ted-yoho-upsets-cliff-stearns-12-term-incumbent-not-conceding#ixzz23d9TXqnP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida Times-Union</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><em>For an automatic recount to occur, there has to be less than a one-half of 1 percent margin of victory.</em>

<em>An official number must be determined within three days after the primary. Yoho unofficially won Tuesday by 1.1 percent.</em>

<em>Stearns said he would not concede.</em>

<em>"Since this is a close primary vote and we still need to make sure all voices are heard, we are awaiting the certified results," the campaign said in a statement.</em></blockquote>
<p>Rep. Stearns was considered a <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/14/incumbent-rep-cliff-stearns-loses-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">relative shoe-in for the Republican primary</a>. He has been a congressman for over 20 years, had plenty of campaign money, and handled high-profile political issues as Chairman of a contentious House subcommittee.</p>
