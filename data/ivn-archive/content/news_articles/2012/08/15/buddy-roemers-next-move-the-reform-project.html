<p>When former Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer withdrew from the 2012 presidential race on May 31, among many things he said:</p>
<blockquote><em>As I am no longer a candidate for president, I am free to pledge a good portion of the rest of my life to enacting campaign reform in the halls of Congress and the corridors of the White House. Instead of using my right to the floor of Congress to lobby for corporate clients, I will lobby for the American people who want reform.</em>

...

<em>Join with us. Be unafraid. Weâ€™ll put a new organization together and will use the power of the people and new media unlike any organization has ever done with a political goal.</em></blockquote>
<p>Less than a month after his announcement to drop from the race, the Reform Project was founded.</p>

<p>When it comes to electoral reform and changing the American political atmosphere, the end of a presidential bid is not the end of the line for Gov. Roemer.</p>
