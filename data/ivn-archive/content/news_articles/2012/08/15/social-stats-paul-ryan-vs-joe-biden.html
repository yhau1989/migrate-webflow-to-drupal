<p>Since Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney announced Paul Ryan as his running mate, the media has been in a frenzy, digging up his voting records, speculating on his role in the campaign, and even reporting on his <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/amyodell/paul-ryans-one-fashion-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer">fashion faux paus</a>.</p>

<p>Politicos have been buzzing about his political&nbsp;prospects, but it's his&nbsp;meteoric rise in the social media ranks that's surprised most Americans. Could Paul Ryan be Romney's secret weapon in the social media battle? IVN <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/14/paul-ryan-pick-gives-romney-campaign-social-media-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on the social media&nbsp;clout&nbsp;Ryan brings to the Romney campaign earlier this week.</p>
<blockquote><em>Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan is somewhat of a social media mogul. Romney’s inclusion of the Wisconsin representative may be the boost he needs to motivate his somewhat stagnant online following.</em></blockquote>
<p>But how does he compare with his Vice Presidential opponent, Joe Biden? We've analyzed both Paul Ryan and Joe Biden's social&nbsp;activity&nbsp;and success in three categories online: Facebook, Twitter, and Online Fundraising. Our conclusion: Paul Ryan takes home the gold, earning the title of social media star.</p>

<p>CNN partnered with Facebook to study the popularity of political candidates on the world's largest social network. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/13/politics/what-caught-our-eye/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The findings</a> show that Paul Ryan, who&nbsp;entered&nbsp;the political spotlight just last week, now surpasses President Obama as the most-talked about politician on Facebook.</p>

<p>With 713,342 likes,&nbsp;Rep. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/PaulRyanVP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Ryan's VP page</a> now has over twice as many as Joe Biden's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/joebiden" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, and that number is sure to rise. Ryan's page was created less than a week ago, while Biden's has been in existence for almost four years now. A <a href="http://redalertpolitics.com/2012/08/15/paul-ryan-now-more-popular-on-social-media-than-vp-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer">closer look</a> into the demographics of his page likes reveals that contrary to <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/08/13/a-conservative-twist-on-the-hey-girl-meme/" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular belief</a>, Paul Ryan's fans are not primarily female. Thirty-seven percent of the page's new likes are female, outnumbered by the 63 percent that are men, according to Red Alert Politics.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Twitter:</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>While Paul Ryan isn't new to the 140-character limit of Twitter, he has created a new Twitter account strictly for his VP prospects, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulryanvp" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PaulRyanVP</a>. In three short days, he's already climbed the Twitter ranks, beating out current VP Joe Biden to acquire 113,993 followers to date. Joe Biden, using the official Office of the Vice President Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/VP" rel="noopener noreferrer">@VP</a>, has 79,502 followers. His <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign Twitter account</a>, ran by the Obama 2012 campaign staff, nears Ryan's number, but still trails with 109,164 followers.</p>

<p>Taking full advantage of the hype surrounding Romney's VP pick, the Romney campaign leveraged Paul Ryan to fundraise a recorded $7.4 million, in just 72 hours since the announcement. The Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/243663-romney-campaign-raised-74-million-off-ryan-pick" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>,</p>
<blockquote><em>Mitt Romney's campaign announced Tuesday that it had raised $7.4 million online in the three days since announcing Paul Ryan as the vice presidential pick, via more than 100,000 donations.</em></blockquote>
<p>Catching on, Vice President Joe Biden&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;his supporters <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/biden-complains-in-email-wealthy-right-wing-ideologues-trying-to-buy-election-with-nasty-deceptive-tv-ads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">via email</a>. In a plea for campaign cash, he warned: “we risk letting the other side run away with” the presidency, fearing "a pretty lopsided fight."</p>
