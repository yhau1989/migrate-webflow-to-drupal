<p>Yet another lone gunman with a grudge, this time at the Family Research Council in DC. The intuder pulled a gun on a guard who righfully shot him.</p>
<blockquote>Sources told Fox New that after guard took away his gun, the suspect said, "Don't shoot me, it was not about you, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/08/15/guard-at-family-research-council-shot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was what this place stands for</a>."</blockquote>
<p>FRC is extremely anti-gay, a stance which does not even slightly justify yet another loony deciding to shoot them for whatever deranged reasons.</p>
