<blockquote>2012 Unfiltered aims to strip away the political rhetoric through photos — specifically your photos. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this is your chance to speak volumes, showing political leaders and the country what's on your mind.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/what-does-the-economy-look-like-where-you-live-show-us-with-your-instagram-photos-econdebate--2012-unfiltered/2011/10/04/gIQAAkibLL_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>– Ryan Kellett, Washington Post reporter</em></a></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why they made the cut</strong>: In the virtual world of hastags and @ mentions, social media has seen the rise and fall of movements and trends. It holds truer than ever that one hashtag can single-handedly make or break your career, boosting you to skyrocketing fame or heckled oblivion. The use of hashtags with a more constructive motivation though is seen through the use of The Washington Post’s coverage of the 2012 election happenings through Instagram.</p>
<p>The social media movement was started late last year in response to the success of photos streamed in by instagram users with the hashtag #econdebate. The news platform asked their readers from all over the U.S. to send in their photos answering their question: “What does the economy look like where you live?”.<strong> </strong>Washington Post then took hold of this idea of "photo send-ins" and reached out to the 10 million registered users on Instagram to document their views (literally) on the campaigns and voting events associated with the 2012 elections. The principle hashtag being #2012Unfiltered. The WP posts their favorites on the regularly updated <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/help-us-capture-the-campaign-with-2012-unfiltered/2011/10/14/gIQAJlZQsL_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment stream</a>,&nbsp;ultimately covering politics through visuals. This IVN photo from a Ron Paul rally in San Diego made the Washington Post's cut, and was added to the comment stream back in May (for more, follow us on Instagram at @IVNetwork):</p>

<p>The Washington Post's utilization of social media platforms like Instagram to mobilize a large base of users in political ways, demonstrates a tech savvy strategy. With the U.S.'s growing <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/18/confidence-in-tv-news-at-new-low/" rel="noopener noreferrer">distrust</a> of news media, the use of social media movements such as these proves the increasing prevalence of grassroots modes of spreading information.</p>
