<p><img alt="" height="400" src="cloudinary://Rand-Paul-Min-Wage.jpeg" title="Rand Paul Min Wage" width="600">The Concerned American Voters (CAV) Super PAC is a newly formed PAC that "seeks to elect principled constitutionalists to public office." It's most notable supporters are Republican Senator <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/08/07/ron-paul-and-son-rand-paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a> of Kentucky, and Representative <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/07/26/social-media-spotlight-rep-justin-amash/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Amash</a>&nbsp;of Michigan, who boast in a recent email about their most recent successful victory in of helping&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/08/01/ted-cruz-scores-ron-paul-a-win-in-texas-senate-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a> win his U.S. Senate primary in Texas. But this Justin Amash and Rand Paul PAC isn't going to operate like your typical multi-million dollar Koch-like operation.</p>

<p>The Super PAC is now looking for 20 full-time activists to operate a high-tech phone bank and turn out voters from their homebase Arlington, VA. &nbsp;"Only the most committed activists can handle it," it says their latest unsolicited e-mail. &nbsp;You will work 8-12 hours, 6-7 days a week they say, at a rate of $200/week, plus lodging and meals.</p>

<p>In this downtrodden economy, maybe this is an attractive offer to someone trying to break into the political world. &nbsp;Or is the Justin Amash and Rand Paul Super PAC overly optimistic about the ability to&nbsp;entice&nbsp;quality activist labor?</p>
