<p>A recent editorial in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443687504577567051040668984.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a> by Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, lays out the threat of Iran and urges diplomatic action as "time is short". This follows <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2012/0731/New-Iran-sanctions-why-President-Obama-is-tightening-the-screws" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently announced sanctions</a> by the Obama administration on banks doing business with Iran. Throughout this presidential election cycle, Iran has come up and is a pretty safe target for American lawmakers to look "tough".</p>
