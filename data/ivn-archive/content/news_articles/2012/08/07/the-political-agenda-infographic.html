<p>This quick infographic created by <a href="http://lab42.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lab42</a>, a market research company backed by Sandbox Industries, illustrates the key opinions Americans have on various aspects of social media and its "political agenda". Interestingly enough, some key stats include Fox News beating out NPR in terms of fair and balanced news and an overwhelmingly majority of people saying "yes" they would support an Independent or Third Party candidate for president.</p>

<p><em>The main point to take from this graphic? When asked for thoughts on the two party political system, people answered: "There Is No Way To Have All The People's Ideas Fit Into 2 Parties".</em></p>
