<p>Want to find the closest Democrat in your neighborhood? Let Barack Obama help you. His new app allows you to find Democrats on a map, with their name and address. Borderline creepy? Or is he taking canvassing to the next level?</p>

<p>The New York Times <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/obama-campaign-releases-iphone-app-for-canvassing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">calls it</a>&nbsp;“the science-fiction dream of political operatives," while <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/06/is_your_neighbor_a_democrat_obama_has_an_app_for_that_salpart/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> refers to it as a "creepy" new app.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Obama campaign defends the app, arguing that there are no new privacy issues.</p>

<p><em>“Anyone familiar with the political process in America knows this information about registered voters is available and easily accessible to the public.”</em></p>

<p>What do you think of the new app? Innovative, or just plain creepy?</p>
