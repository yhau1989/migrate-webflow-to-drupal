<p>Voter ID and voter fraud are often linked. But, a popular understanding of voter fraud, people posing as another individual on Election Day, was shown to be "infinitesimal" according to a <a href="http://votingrights.news21.com/article/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> conducted by Arizona State University. Today <a href="http://ivn.us/voters/Damon_Eris/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon Eris</a>&nbsp;posted an article on dev.us regarding the study and its results. The study covered years 2000-2012 and uncovered that 10 incidences of in-person voter fraud have occurred throughout the country during that time.</p>



<p>Voter fraud in this form would be combatted by requiring would-be voters to produce a voter ID when they attempt to vote. This would minimize the ability of individuals to fraudulently pose as another registered voter. As discussed briefly above, these requirements could <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/section/category/voter_id" rel="noopener noreferrer">disenfranchise</a> 11% of eligible voters across the country.&nbsp;While this is a large percentage of the voting population the threat that is posed is not remotely similar to the disenfranchisement. The threat is that one individual is able to cast an extra ballot because a government-issued ID does not verify their identity. A wrongdoer would be limited by the time the polls are open and the geographic distance between them.</p>



<p>Regardless, the probability of a large group of individuals being able to cast enough fraudulent ballots, by posing as other people is extraordinarily low. When that threat is compared with 11% of eligible voters being disenfranchised by an ID requirement is, the costs of the ID laws severely outweigh the benefits. As the Brennan Center <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/section/category/voter_id" rel="noopener noreferrer">points</a> out, the occurrence of this type of voter fraud is less likely than an individual being struck by lightning.</p>



<p>Voter fraud is a foolish move in the first place for individuals attempting to swing an election. The <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/section/category/voter_id" rel="noopener noreferrer">punishment</a> for federal election fraud is 5 years and a $10,000 fine.&nbsp;The return on the risk is only a single vote.</p>



<p>Linking voter IDs and voter fraud is essentially comparing apples to oranges. If voter fraud at a scale that was remotely proportional to the amount of individuals knowingly disenfranchised by voter ID laws, a much stronger argument would be made for them. What Independents should understand is that the connection between voter IDs and voter fraud as a major threat to democracy is tenuous at best.</p>
