<p>It's no secret that social media is&nbsp;revolutionizing&nbsp;the way in which we interact with politics, and the 2012 election is evidence of the growing role of Twitter in the revolution of reporting.&nbsp;By the end of the first day of the Republican National convention, there had been more tweets relating to the convention than 2008 saw during the entirety of the convention.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, August 28, Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/08/tweets-rev-up-as-rnc-kicks-off.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that tweets relating to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gop2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GOP2012</a> peaked at <strong>1,448 tweets per minute</strong> at 5:44p ET. But the most tweets came at the end of <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnDRomney" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AnnDRomney</a>'s speech, during which there were <strong>6,195 tweets per minute</strong>, beating out politicians such as&nbsp;Gov. Chris Christie and former Senator Rick Santorum.</p>

<p>Also, her&nbsp;<a href="http://election.twitter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Political Index</a> reveals that sentiment towards her on Twitter was positive:</p>
<blockquote><em>It wasn’t just that Mrs. Romney’s speech inspired&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of conversation, but Twitter responded positively as well. Her&nbsp;<a href="http://election.twitter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Political Index</a>&nbsp;score nearly doubled over the course of her speech, from 45 to 83— the biggest increase for any of the night’s speakers.</em></blockquote>
