<p>Would like to give Michelle Obama a slow clap for her sartorial choice at the recent NATO Summit held in Chicago. As style blog <a href="http://mrs-o.com/newdata/2012/5/21/nato-spouses-in-chicago.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mrs. O</em></a> reports, she wore an inspired sheath dress and blazer combination by Zac Posen, with a modern cut and interesting neckline. The fit was perfect for the First Lady. It is always refreshing to see contemporary, non-boring suits worn on high-profile professional women.</p>
