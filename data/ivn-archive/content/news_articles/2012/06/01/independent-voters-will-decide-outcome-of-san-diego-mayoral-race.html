<p>A poll conducted by the Super PAC ‘icPurple’ shows that the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic</a> heavyweights in San Diego’s bitter race for mayor are leading in the polls. However, Republican turned Independent Nathan Fletcher is within the margin of error, trailing Bob Filner (D) by just 3%.</p>

<p>icPurple has already spent over a quarter million dollars in support of <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/independent-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent candidates</a> in <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine</a>. Most of the expenditures have been to purchase advertising space for a commercial produced by the group seen below.</p>

<p>According to icPurple’s May 31st press release, a privately commissioned, scientific survey of 400 likely primary voters show:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>A statistical dead heat between candidates Nathan Fletcher, (18%) Bob Filner (21%), and Carl Demaio (22%), with approximately 25% of likely voters undecided.</li>
	<li>After being shown TV ads that demonstrate Fletcher’s independence, likely voters put Fletcher in first at 22%, with Demaio and Filner each taking 21%, and 24% remaining undecided. These numbers are all within the margin of error.</li>
	<li><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independents</a> are the most undecided, and Independents who are decided are most prone to backing Fletcher.</li>
	<li>When No Party Preference voters learn that Nathan Fletcher is an Independent, he is their likely candidate.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>icPurple also announced that it has received another $150,000 to continue running its commercial. Studies have shown that the “positive message … resonates with voters of each party.”</p>

<p>In addition to supporting Fletcher, the group has purchased ad space for former <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/07/independent-angus-king-issues-warning-to-partisan-foes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Independent Angus King Issues Warning to Partisan Foes">Independent Governor Angus King</a> who is running for Senate in Maine. In California, they are also supporting Independents including <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/29/joe-coto-and-chad-walsh-win-online-survey-of-indie-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Joe Coto and Chad Walsh win Online Survey of Indie Voters">Chad Walsh</a>, who is running for State Assembly in Silicon Valley, <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/03/01/condit-countrys-comeback-kid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Condit Country’s Comeback Kid">Chad Condit</a> for Congress in the Central Valley, and <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/05/24/26th-congressional-indie-candidate-tops-ivn-survey-of-independent-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Linda Parks Tops IVN Survey of Independent Voters in CD-26">Linda Parks</a> for Congress in Ventura.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Linda Parks is running against a Nathan Fletcher-endorsed and party line Republican Tony Strickland. Previous polls have shown that Parks and Strickland will likely face off in November.</p>

<p>Ironically, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican</a> party endorsed candidate Carl DeMaio is closing his campaign with a large TV buy touting his "independent" credentials. Meantime, Fletcher's late switch and his endorsement of Tony Strickland has made it difficult for the former Republican to command the critical "authenticity" factor which IVN.us polling has consistently shown to be the key criteria for independent voters.</p>

<p>icPurple is founded by Ted Waitt, a nonpartisan philanthropist and founder of Gateway computers. According to their website, icPurple “is a movement of the ever-growing share of American voters who are tired of our government’s paralysis at the hands of partisan politics.”</p>
