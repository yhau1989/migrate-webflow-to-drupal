<p>In order to vote in Florida, one must confirm their citizenship through a voter identification program, aimed at preventing non-citizen residents from voting in Florida elections. Gov. Rick Scott implemented the program in response to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's refusal to grant the state&nbsp;access&nbsp;to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database, leading the Florida&nbsp;Governor&nbsp;to file suit.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice&nbsp;retaliated, categorizing these purges as violations to two federal voting rights laws, filing a lawsuit against Florida Governor Rick Scott's administration.</p>

<p>In defense of the multi-stage, public process, Scott argues:</p>
<blockquote>"Look the debate’s over. We clearly have proof that citizens that don’t have the right to vote, non-citizens, are voting in our elections. As your governor I have an obligation to enforce the law and I intend to do that." - Governor Rick Scott</blockquote>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez fires back,</p>
<blockquote>“In short, your claim that the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security have worked in concert to deny Florida access to the SAVE Program is simply wrong.” - Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez</blockquote>
<p>Adding to the mess of litigation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights Under Law sued Gov. Scott's administration last week in an attempt to stop the voter roll purge.</p>
