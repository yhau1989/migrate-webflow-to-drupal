<p>What would you tweet if given full control over your country's official Twitter account? In a project called <em>Curators of Sweden</em>, the official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sweden" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Sweden</a>&nbsp;is handed off directly to the country's citizens. Each week, a new Swede is given the opportunity to freely tweet whatever comes to mind.</p>

<p>While the project has been going on for 24 weeks, it made national&nbsp;headlines yesterday when a 27 year old mother of two, Sonja,&nbsp;was publicly ridiculed for her comments on Jewish and gay people. Since then, her tweets have been the talk of the nation, causing many to criticize Sweden's strategy.</p>

<p>The Social Media Manager at Visitsweden <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/06/12/sweden-stands-by-twitter-strategy-despite-controversy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">defends</a> the project, telling the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s very important for us to let everyone take a unique viewpoint. Every one of our curators is there with a different perspective.” - Tommy Sollén</blockquote>
<p>The Twitter community reacted with outrage, yet the number of people following the account skyrocketed from 34,000 to roughly 46,000 followers.</p>

<p>And censorship is out of the question.</p>
<blockquote>“You cannot look at any specific tweet, you can only judge a curator on the whole week…How else are you going to show the multi-faceted people that Sweden is composed of?”&nbsp; - Tommy Sollén</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not you agree with the reasoning behind the social media experiment, it's hard to deny that Sonja is doing her part in sharing a very "unique" viewpoint:</p>
<blockquote>The dinner was horrible. It felt like eating your way through a shaved vikings chest, while he's trying to kill you.

— @sweden / Sonja (@sweden) <a href="https://twitter.com/sweden/status/212940657206099968" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 13, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>So, what would you tweet if given full access to the official United States Twitter account?</p>
