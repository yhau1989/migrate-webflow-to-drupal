<p>Much has been made of the recent endorsement of Romney by Dr. Paul's son Rand. &nbsp;Anyone who kids&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;into believing Rand's endorsement was not 100% political &nbsp;is, well, kidding themselves. &nbsp;Ron Paul will not in a million years endorse Romney, because Romney is 80% of what Ron Paul and his supporters think is wrong with American politics.</p>

<p>No one can say Johnson is not credible. He is a two-term governor with high approval ratings and he has a demeanor that is both welcoming and refreshing in a political atmosphere that is full of mudslinging and name-calling. &nbsp;In other words, Johnson will be the grown-up at the debates.</p>

<p>But to get to the debates, Johnson needs the critical mass of supporters. &nbsp;Now, Ron Paul's most passionate supporters have probably already migrated to Johnson's campaign, but if the elder Paul joins his ticket, there is an air of credibility, a base of support, and a pool of money to turn up the volume for a Johnson/Paul platform.</p>

<p>Many people say, "I like a lot of what Ron Paul has to say ... some things are just a little too crazy." &nbsp;Well, Johnson is a more temperate Ron Paul. &nbsp;Put them on the same ticket, and Romney can say goodnight to his bid for the Presidency.</p>
