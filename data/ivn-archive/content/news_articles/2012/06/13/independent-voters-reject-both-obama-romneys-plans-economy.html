<p>Look what <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/06/a-chilly-reception-from-independents-on-obamas-plans-for-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> is reporting:</p>
<blockquote>"Swing-voting independents see Barack Obama’s plans for the economy negatively rather than positively by 54-38 percent in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, marking the president’s challenges as he seeks re-election in still-troubled economic times.

It’s no party for Mitt Romney either. Independents also rate his economic plans more unfavorably than favorably, by 47-35 percent. But more are undecided, giving Romney some room to maneuver; unlike Obama, Romney avoids majority criticism in this group."</blockquote>
<p>Romney might fare marginally better, but still, a 12 point gap on favorability for his economic plans isn't exactly a vote of confidence. My advice to independents who don't believe either candidate will improve the economy with their policy agenda is not to give in to the "lesser-of-two-evils" mentality by November.&nbsp; You're only really throwing away your vote if you vote for someone you don't strongly prefer merely because they are only marginally less harmful than the alternative. Instead, pick a third party or independent candidate that you really believe will make the country stronger.</p>

<p>Just my personal opinion.</p>
