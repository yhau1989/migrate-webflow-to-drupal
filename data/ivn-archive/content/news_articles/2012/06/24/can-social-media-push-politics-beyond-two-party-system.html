We were recently asked whether social media sites, specifically Ruck.us, can&nbsp;"really can make a difference in the [two-party] political world given that it is run and funded largely by Democrats?" &nbsp;First, I don't think it matters that Ruck.us is funded largely by Democrats. The question of whether social media can make a difference in our two-party political system should be answered before we get to that issue.<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RuckUs.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="197" src="cloudinary://RuckUs-300x197.jpg" title="RuckUs" width="300"></a></p>
<div>I support any attempt to "democratize" the process and bring the political dialogue to regular people. &nbsp;However, with respect to social media, I believe that to have a real impact, a website has to capture more than just those willing to participate in social media political circles. &nbsp;While the majority of voters might find themselves on some for of social network, I do not think the average voter will spend their time talking about politics online. &nbsp;The average voter is folding their laundry, taking care of their kids, and watching a football game.</div>

<div>Those of us who live in the political world, right or wrong, often lose sight of this. &nbsp;While Ruck.us has admirable goals and may ultimately meet a great level of success, I am not sure whether it will be able to have an affect that "goes beyond the two-party system." &nbsp;I think that the political dialogue must change on a more general level before those involved enough to join a political social network will have the power to change it. &nbsp;After all, the people folding their laundry, taking care of their kids, and watching the football game, stopped listening to our political rants a long time ago.</div>
