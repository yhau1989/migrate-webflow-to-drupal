<p>Republican backlash to the&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/06/15/obamas-immigration-policy-spurs-gop-criticism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">changes</a> in immigration policy made Friday by the president has been relatively mild, with GOP leaders backing down from attacks.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Obama halted deportation of illegal immigrants who have met a certain criteria and gave them the opportunity to apply for work permits in the country.</p>

<p>In response to Obama's immigration plan, presidential candidate Mitt Romney told CBS News' Bob Schieffer:</p>
<blockquote>If he really wanted to make a solution that dealt with these kids or with the illegal immigration in America, then this is something he would have taken up in his first three and a half years, not in his last few months.</blockquote>
<p>Schieffer asked Romney five times if he would repeal Obama's "mini-DREAM Act," but Romney refused to answer. Salon's Alex Seitz-Wald <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/06/18/gop_takes_a_pass_on_immigration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>&nbsp;Romney's options:</p>
<blockquote>He can’t praise Obama, but he can’t slam the new policy too hard and risk looking like he hates Latinos.</blockquote>

<div>Also, House Republicans canceled an afternoon news conference on Obama's policy, refusing to state why.</div>
