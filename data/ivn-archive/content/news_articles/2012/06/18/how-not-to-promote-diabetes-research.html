<p><strong>By encouraging customers to consume half their daily caloric intake via a beverage with 224 grams of sugar.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In a new promotion, a&nbsp;KFC franchise in Utah promises to donate $1 of every $2.99 half-gallon drink it sells to Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).</p>

<p>One "Mega Jug" contains 800 calories and 56 spoonfuls of sugar.</p>

<p>One has to wonder, is&nbsp;this really the best way to promote diabetes research?</p>

<p>While the owner had good intentions, Jenn Savedge from Mother Nature Network <a href="http://www.mnn.com/family/family-activities/blogs/curing-diabetes-with-soda" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarks</a>:</p>

<p>"At the very least, the owner could have tied this promotion to sales of grilled chicken rather than soda."</p>

<p>Would you buy a half-gallon of Sprite in the name of diabetes research?</p>
