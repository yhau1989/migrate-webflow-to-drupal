<p>With competition heating up between <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> and former <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mitt-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gov. Mitt Romney</a>, a special election in Arizona, the possibility of an <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a> voice in Senate, and some pretty controversial ballot measures,&nbsp;here are 5 things we're watching today in politics.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong><strong>) Arizona to hold special election to replace Rep. Giffords</strong></p>

<p>Arizona's 8th district will hold a special election today, voting to fill the vacancy of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords, who resigned to focus on her recovery after her January 2011 shooting, has been campaigning for Democrat Ron Barber, speaking at a get-out-the-vote rally on Saturday.</p>

<p>Because of Giffords' popularity in Southern Arizona, Republicans have been attacking President Obama in hopes of capturing the formerly Democratic seat. As recent Public Policy Polling <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/05/obama-trails-in-arizona.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">numbers</a> show, Arizona voters are unhappy with Obama's job performance, and he now trails to Romney by 7 percentage points.</p>

<p>Jesse Kelly, former Iraq War veteran, is the Republican candidate. While Arizona's 8th district is more moderate than the state as a whole, Republicans hold an advantage in registered voters, with 25,000 more registered <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans</a> than Democrats.</p>

<p>The outcome of the race is critical for <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrats</a>, who need to hold on to this seat in order to regain control of the House.</p>

<p><strong>2) &nbsp;Maine Senate race gets voice of an Independent</strong></p>

<p>Independent Angus King holds a commanding lead going into today's Maine Senate race. Up against four Democrats and six Republicans, King leads his opponents by over 30 points in the most recent&nbsp;Maine People's Resource Center&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bz1xw7lZwFn_WUw2ajJ0UXFSQzI0LVRSdGZDU3pfZw/edit?pli=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">public opinion survey</a>. Voting for Bush in 2000 and backing Barack Obama in the 2012 race, King represents a truly nonpartisan <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2012/06/11/politics/maines-angus-king-works-the-middle-ground-in-senate-bid/?ref=latest" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>"My desire is to be as independent as I can be, as long as I can be, subject to being effective,” he said. “I’m not going just for symbolism. I want to do something.”</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>3) Obama's re-election campaign focuses on police, firefights, and teachers&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After a recent statement by Romney on public servants, the Obama team has jumped on the opportunity to attack the former Governor, releasing an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9ZmHiznewM8" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack ad </a>yesterday. Romney's original statement was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><em>"He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of&nbsp;Wisconsin? It’s time for us to cut back on government and help the American people.”</em></blockquote>
<p>Obama took this to mean cutting public servants, categorizing his economic plan in&nbsp;Massachusetts&nbsp;as a failure. Romney called the claims "completely absurd," <a href="http://www.fednews.com/transcript.html?item=20120612t6316&amp;op=el&amp;addr=EL1-EC1-FN30" rel="noopener noreferrer">telling</a> the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends "the federal government doesn’t pay for teachers, firefighters, or policeman."</p>

<p><strong>4) North Dakota votes to end property tax</strong></p>

<p>On the ballot in North Dakota is <a href="http://www.nola.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/nd-weighs-becoming-1st-state-to-end-property-taxes/e50f3b16e7a5491a816fb13fc527348a" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measure 2</a>, which aims to eliminate local property taxes. If passed, North Dakota would become the first state in the United States to eliminate property taxes. Members of the group Empower the Taxpayer worked to put the measure on the ballot, receiving the 27,000 voter signatures required to demand the vote. <a href="http://www.valleynewslive.com/story/18749356/ballot-measures-opposite-outcomes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polls</a> shows that voters are overwhelmingly against the measure, with 70% of state voters likely to reject it.&nbsp;The&nbsp;controversial&nbsp;nature of this measure has already yielded high voter turnout, and will likely result in record highs in some North Dakota counties.</p>

<p><strong>5) Romney Kicks Off Bus Tour&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Romney plans to launch his "Every Town Counts"&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77274.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">bus tour</a>,&nbsp;which focuses on campaigning in six swing states over the course of five days. Kicking off in New Hampshire, Romney will visit Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan, making appearances in small towns across the states. The latest poll from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.purplestrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/6.2012-Purple-Poll.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=PurplePoll-+June+2012+from+Doug&amp;utm_content=PurplePoll-+June+2012+from+Doug+CID_db30bbf043eb1c838139ae9e94edb98a&amp;utm_source=Email+marketing+software&amp;utm_term=Our+latest+PurplePoll" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purple Strategies</a>&nbsp;shows Obama with a narrow lead in swing states, but Romney leading in Ohio and Florida.</p>
