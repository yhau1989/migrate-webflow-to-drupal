<p>Those of you who come to IVN.us regularly know that things are changing quickly here. &nbsp;But what we are building at IVN is more than just another news source. &nbsp;Our goal is to create both a forum and an atmosphere that promotes discussion among those do not see eye-to-eye on every issue.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, expect rapid change and the addition of new features such as personal blogs, author political tendency charts, better e-mail updates, and dashboard tutorials to assist writers in making the most of their posts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we ask for your patience as we build this network together. &nbsp;We have ambitious goals, but a relatively small team. &nbsp;IVN.us (a publication of the <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a>) is built on the ideas and energy of a small and young team who each bring a unique and necessary component to the long development process.</p>

<p>If you find a bug in the system, or something just isn't working like it should be, please let us know. &nbsp;You can e-mail us anytime at contact@ivn.us.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you and having your participation at IVN.us.</p>
