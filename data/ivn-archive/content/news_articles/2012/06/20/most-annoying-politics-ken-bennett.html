<p>Arizona's Secretary of State Ken Bennett made national headlines last month for threatening to keep Barack Obama off the Arizona ballot in November, still unconvinced in the authenticity of the president's birth certificate released by the White House last year. After public ridicule, it seems like the No. 2 elected official in Arizona has given up on the birther issue and is now developing a conspiracy theory to ensure that President Obama is sent home, "wherever home is," he adds. In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq8kP-MSQO8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m23s" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 14th speech</a> posted on Monday (you can watch below), the Secretary of State says:</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;“Now, I know there’s a lot of people that are very skeptical as to whether he was born in Hawaii,” Bennett told the crowd. “Personally I believe that he was. I actually believe he was fibbing about being born in Kenya when he was trying to get into college and doing things like writing a book and on and on and on.”</blockquote>
<p>Skip to about 6:30 in the video below, where he begins explaining his theory with very extensive hand gestures.</p>

<p>He mentions that President Obama sent $1.5-2 million to have his college records and "all that stuff" sealed, but never cites where he gets these numbers from, or what evidence he is basing his theory. He continues,</p>
<blockquote>So if you're spending money to seal something, that's probably where the hanky panky was going on.</blockquote>
<p>With pressing issues like the economy, unemployment, job creation, sustainable energy, and immigration at the forefront of the presidential election, why hasn't Bennett given up on the birther debate already?</p>
