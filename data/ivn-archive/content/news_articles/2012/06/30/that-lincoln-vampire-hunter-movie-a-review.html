<p>First, I want to make it clear that this is the first movie I have seen in probably a year. &nbsp;Why Lincoln Vampire Hunter? &nbsp;That's a good damn question because there are lots of movies that I really wanted to see, then never went. &nbsp;But this one? &nbsp;Well a co-worker has the poster for some reason above her desk, so on sort of a whim we decided to take the whole office.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not a vampire person: I am neither a vampire nor a vampire enthusiast. &nbsp;The plot line is pretty ridiculous and any Southerner should be completely offended in that, apparently, the&nbsp;confederacy consisted of&nbsp;soulless evil vampires. &nbsp;But, the movie does keep the attention long enough to forget that a Douglas character makes an appearance in the beginning of the movie but is never really developed.</p>

<p>In an attempt not to ruin this historical cinema by giving away all its&nbsp;surprises, I would say that if you like Kill Bill, you will probably like this movie. &nbsp;You will be a little&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;that its not nearly as good as Kill Bill, but it is full of all the same revenge, over-the-top slow-motion sequences, and historical accuracy.</p>
