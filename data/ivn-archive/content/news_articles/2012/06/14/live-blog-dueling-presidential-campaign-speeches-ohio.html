<p><em>Both Mitt Romney and President Obama are giving campaign speeches in Ohio today. President Obama's speech has been touted as a major statement on the economy.</em></p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>David Axelrod, President Obama's campaign advisor, will now be taking questions submitted to @BarackObama with the hashtag #Obama2012</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>After an hour, Obama ends his speech with,&nbsp;"this November you can provide a mandate..." and of course, reminding the crowd that America is the best nation.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Battle of the busses? Romney and Obama face off in Ohio, and as CBS White House correspondent&nbsp;Mark Knoller tweets:</p>
<blockquote>Romney Campaign bus - emblazoned with Romney Campaign logo - is driving around Pres Obama's speech site honking its horn.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/romney-campaign-bus-circling-honking-at-obama-speech" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking Points Memo</a> has reports of the Romney campaign bus circling President Obama's speech site, earlier today.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Obama acknowledges last week's gaffe on the private sector, stating:</p>
<blockquote><em>There will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about. You may have heard I&nbsp;reasonably&nbsp;made my own unique contribution to that process. It won’t be the first time, it won’t be the last.</em></blockquote>
<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson is not giving a speech on the economy today, but he's not afraid to chime in the debate:</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Obama cites "shared responsibility" as guide to all of his economic policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Obama: If you want to give the policies of the last decade another try, you should vote for Mr. Romney. You should vote for his allies.</p>
<blockquote>Obama: "This has to be our North star. An economy that grows not from the top down but from the middle class."

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Obama has&nbsp;conceded this election will come down to two competing views of economic recovery, and argues, "nothing is more important than an honest debate on where these two paths will lead us."</p>

<p>On the president's message,</p>
<blockquote>Barack Obama is finally making the pragmatic economic case for income inequality slowing growth, instead of just yelling about fairness.

— Zach Green (@140elect) <a href="https://twitter.com/140elect/status/213332776143958016" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 14, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Obama's makes multiple references to Bush and the state of the economy before he took office. A good strategy, based on <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/06/14/americans-blame-bush-bad-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this morning's Gallup Poll findings</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<blockquote>The difference in @<a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama" rel="noopener noreferrer">BarackObama</a>/@<a href="https://twitter.com/MittRomney" rel="noopener noreferrer">MittRomney</a> is stark: POTUS focuses on stability/security - Romney on "freedom" to succeed &amp; fail

<p>--</p>

<p>UPDATE: <em>"A make or break moment"&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The crowd in Ohio chants "Four More Years" as Obama begins his speech. The president opens his speech by agreeing with his opponent Mitt Romney:</p>
<blockquote><em>"This election is about our economic future."&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>Obama points out that the election comes down to two fundamentally different viewpoints on the economy.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I have said that this is the defining issue of our time and I mean it."&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
