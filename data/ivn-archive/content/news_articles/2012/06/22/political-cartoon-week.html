<p>What do a student and a member of Congress have in common?</p>

<p>Recent statistics put forth by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/19/politics/congress-productivity/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>&nbsp;may help clarify:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Congress has only passed 132 laws since the beginning of its session in 2011. About one-fifth of those measures were to approve official names for post offices. This is less than half as many laws as the two previous legislatures.</strong></blockquote>
