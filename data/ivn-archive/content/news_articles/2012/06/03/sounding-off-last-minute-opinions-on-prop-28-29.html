<p>There are two ballot initiatives voters will be deciding on this coming Tuesday. <a href="http://ivn.us/proposition-28-term-limits/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 28</a> deals with term limits, while <a href="http://ivn.us/proposition-29-additional-tax-on-cigarettes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 29</a> will impose a $1 cigarette tax for cancer research. IVN has the pros and cons of both measures, as well as <a href="http://ivn.us/election-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer">opinion editorials</a> for each side. As the day draws nearer and advertising ramps up, particularly for Prop. 29, new polling gives insight on how the election may play out.</p>

<p>Willie Brown, former Speak of California's State Assembly and Mayor of San Francisco, has a strong opinion on Prop. 28, and wrote about it in his <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/06/02/BAG01OQV5P.DTL#ixzz1wkgPuv63" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco Chronicle column</a> today. <em></em></p>
<blockquote><em>"I am adamantly opposed to Proposition 28 to modify term limits for California state legislators.As the No. 1 victim of term limits, I consider them an abomination and cannot support anything to make them more palatable. The only move I support is their total repeal."</em></blockquote>
<p>A recent poll of likely voters shows Mr. Brown may be disappointed come Wednesday. A Field Poll released on May 31st shows Prop. 28 is in a good position to pass, with 50% of likely voters supporting the passage of Prop. 28. 22% of those polled are still undecided. No party preference voters support Prop. 28 slightly more than Democrat and Republican voters, with moderates supporting the measure with the most decisiveness.</p>

<p>The same Field Poll shows a closer margin for Prop. 29, yet still a narrow lead in favor of passing the initiative, which would raise cigarette tax by a dollar. 50% of those polled support the measure, versus 42% opposed. Only 8% of voters report being undecided on Prop. 29.</p>

<p>The closer margin is no surprise given the amount of advertising concerning Prop. 29. Over $40 million has been spent on TV ads for or against the measure. The Field Poll found those who choose to vote by mail support Prop. 29 by a ten-point margin, while those planning to vote on June 5 support the cigarette tax by a smaller, five-point margin.</p>
