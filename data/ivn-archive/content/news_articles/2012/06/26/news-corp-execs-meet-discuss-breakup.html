<blockquote><em>The spinoff, which could be announced as early as this week, comes as News Corporation’s newspapers, once the foundation of Rupert Murdoch’s $50 billion media empire, face financial strain and a decline in print advertising. The company’s British publishing unit, meanwhile, is still reeling from a phone-hacking scandal that led to the closure of its News of the World tabloid.</em>
