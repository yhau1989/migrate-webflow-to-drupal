<p>After a turbulent and costly Republican primary season, we can be pretty certain that the list of presumptive presidential candidates 2012 will be as follows:<strong> Barack Obama</strong> (Democratic Party), <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> (Republican Party), <strong>Jill Stein</strong> (Green Party), and<strong> Gary Johnson</strong> (Libertarian Party).</p>

<p>Think you know the presidential candidates 2012? Think again. Below are ten unusual facts about the candidates to help you better get to know them!</p>

<p><strong>1. "The Mitt"</strong></p>

<p>Next time you walk into a barber shop in Boston, ask for "The Mitt." Yes, you heard right. One of the presidential candidates 2012 has a hair style named after himself. Modeled after Romney's classic, clean cut, and impecably styled hair, it's become one of the most recognizable hair styles in Boston.&nbsp;Romney's hair dresser of over twenty years, Leon de Magistris, explains the style:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I will tell him to mess it up a little bit, but he wants a look that is very controlled. He is a very controlled man ... It is not something stylish. It is clean and conservative." - On Mitt's hair&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>A tip for those of you trying to replicate "The Mitt," he doesn't use product or dye - it's all natural.</p>

<p><strong>2. How many are Harvard Grads?</strong></p>

<p>Three out of four of the presidential candidates 2012 attended Harvard University.&nbsp;Jill Stein not only attended, but graduated magna cum laude in 1973. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney both earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School. Romney also studied business at Harvard, receiving an MBA as a Baker Scholar.</p>

<p><strong>3. Jill Stein Thinks Romney's A Fake&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When asked what she thinks about the presumed Republican candidate, Stein remarked:</p>
<blockquote><em>"He responds to his electorate. When he’s running in Salt Lake, he’s anti-abortion. When he’s running in Massachusetts, he’s pro-abortion." - Stein on Mitt</em></blockquote>
<p>Okay, maybe "fake" is an overstatement, but she clearly takes issue with his desire to please the electorate.</p>

<p><strong>4. Barack Obama was quite the poet&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As revealed through letters and journals from two of Barack Obama's ex-girlfriends, Barack Obama cited poetry in his youth.
