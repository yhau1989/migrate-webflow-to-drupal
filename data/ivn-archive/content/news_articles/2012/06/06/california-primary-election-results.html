<p><strong>Update: Independent Bill Bloomfield Could Advance To November Election</strong></p>

<p>In an election marked by electoral reform, it looks as though Independent candidate Bill Bloomfield will advance in California's 33rd Congressional District. With 26.3% of the vote and almost 13,000 votes, he is trailing only to incumbent Henry Waxman, who's name recognition and popularity in the district has secured him 43.3% of the vote.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Close Contest for Democrats in San Diego's 52nd District</strong></p>

<p>With just over 70% of the precincts reporting, it looks as though incumbent Brian Bilbray (R) has secured the spot as top vote getter, advancing to the November Election.</p>

<p>Democrats Lori Saldana and Scott Peters are in a close race for second, with 21.8% and 22.6% of the vote, respectively. Also running is Independent Jack Doyle, who in fourth place, has received 4% of the vote.</p>

<p><strong>Update: California Voters Rejecting Proposition 29&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>With over half the state's votes counted, the $1 tobacco tax is falling short, with 50.3% opposing the tax.&nbsp;Maybe the vote has something to do with the $47 million spent by big tobacco companies on the Vote No campaign.</p>

<p>California voters also voted on Proposition 28, which with overwhelming support, is set to pass. The measure would decrease term limits from 14 years to 12 years, while allowing lawmakers to serve their entire terms in one House.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Elizabeth Emken Advances to November Election</strong></p>

<p>Challenging long-time Democrat Dianne Feinstein in California's U.S. Senate Primary, Republican Elizabeth Emken won 12.3% of the vote, securing her a spot in&nbsp;November's&nbsp;general election. As reported by the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/06/05/4541612/elizabeth-emken-to-challenge-dianne.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter#mi_rss=Latest News#storylink=cpy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacramento Bee</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Emken, a longtime advocate for children with autism, edged out a field of mostly unknown and underfunded Republican rivals to win the state party's endorsement ahead of the primary.</em>

<em>Republican businessman&nbsp;<a href="http://topics.sacbee.com/Dan+Hughes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Hughes,</a>&nbsp;a first-time candidate, came in third with 6 percent of the vote.</em>

<em>The remaining candidates fought for slivers of the vote in early returns, with most of them winning 2 percent or less each of the votes cast.</em></blockquote>
<p>While Emken struggles to compete with Feinstein's name recognition and campaign contributions, she has been taking advantage of radio talkshows and social media, the Sacramento Bee added.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Polls Close in California</strong></p>

<p>Polls will close in California at 8pm Pacific Time.</p>

<p>Four US House races are uncompetitive: CD-37, CD-40, CD-43 and CD-44.</p>

<p><em>Congressional District 37:</em> Democratic incumbent Karen Bass ran unopposed.</p>

<p><em>Congressional District 40:</em> Democratic incumbent Lucille Roybal-Allard and challenger Democrat David Sanchez will advance to November.</p>

<p><em>Congressional District 43:</em> Two Democrats will advance to the November election: incumbent Rep. Maxine Waters and challenger Bob Flores. Although 58.6% of voters in the district are registered Democrats, 23.9% of the district are No Party Preference voters. Both candidates will have to appeal to this broader electorate in November in order to be successful.</p>

<p><em>Congressional District 44:</em> This district had a pretty straightforward primary election contest between two Democrats: Laura Richardson and Janice Hahn. The November election is where it will get interesting, as both candidates will have to compete once again for votes outside of their base. No Party Preference Voters make up 23.3% of this district, with just 13.1% registered Republican.</p>
