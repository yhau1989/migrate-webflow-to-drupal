<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Statement from Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi:</p>

<p><em>This decision is a victory for the American people.&nbsp; With this ruling, Americans will benefit from critical patient protections, lower costs for the middle class, more coverage for families, and greater accountability for the insurance industry.</em></p>

<p><em> The Affordable Care Act is already paying dividends for millions of Americans – with more to come:</em></p>

<p><em> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children can no longer be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions.</em></p>
<p><em> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seniors are paying less for prescription drugs.</em></p>
<p><em> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students and young adults can stay on their parents’ plans.</em></p>
<p><em> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a woman is no longer a pre-existing medical condition.</em></p>

<p><em> In passing health reform, we made history for our nation and progress for the American people.&nbsp; We completed the unfinished business of our society and strengthened the character of our country.&nbsp; We ensured health care would be a right for all, not a privilege for the few. Today, the Supreme Court affirmed our progress and protected that right, securing a future of health and economic security for the middle class and for every American.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>President Obama will address the nation and this morning's health care decision at 12:15pm EST.</p>

<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>Today’s Supreme Court decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act allows us to replace uncertainty with confidence on how to move forward to improve the American health care system. With this decision behind us, we can take a fresh look at our health care cost, quality and structural challenges and turn them into opportunities for American taxpayers and our health care businesses, professionals and patients. With so much of our budget deficits at the federal, state and personal level being driven by health care costs, we cannot afford to waste any more time. We must urgently resolve our health system’s high cost and inefficiency problems.</em>

<em>Now is the time for viable solutions, not angry rhetoric. We urge the administration and members of Congress from both parties to swiftly launch a substantive national dialogue on how to move forward – together with the private sector – on transforming our health care system. The Bipartisan Policy Center stands ready to help make this happen.</em></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>Republicans on Twitter have already started the hashtag #FullRepeal:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523FullRepeal" rel="noopener noreferrer">#FullRepeal</a>

— RNC (@GOP) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOP/status/218349799160807425" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 28, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>The vote is 5-4 in favor of sustaining the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate in the form of a tax. The court holds the mandate does violate the Commerce Clause but that Congress has taxing power.</p>

<p>The Anti-Injunction Act does not apply.</p>

<p>Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito form dissenting opinion</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy reads from the dissent: "In our view, the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong></p>

<p>The decision has yet to be posted online and the Supreme Court's website is overloading, but initial reports by SCOTUSblog contend that the health care individual mandate was upheld.</p>

<p>Justice John Roberts voted to uphold. <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/cover-it-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCOTUSBlog</a>: "So the mandate is constitutional. Chief Justice Roberts joins the left of the Court."</p>

<p>People are still reading the decision, so reports are slowing as experts read through to examine what it all means.</p>

<p>Twitter absolutely exploded with the news, check out more at <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN's Editors' Blog</a>.</p>
