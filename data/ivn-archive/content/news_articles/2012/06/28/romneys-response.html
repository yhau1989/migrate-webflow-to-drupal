<p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney responds to the Supreme Court's ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional:</p>
<blockquote><em>"What the Court did today was say that Obama care did not violate the Constitution. They did not say that it is good law or good policy"</em>

<em>"This is now a time for the American People to make a choice. You can choose whether to have a larger and larger government making intrusions into your life... Or whether instead you want to return to a time where Americans have their own choice in health care."</em>

<em>"If we want to get rid of Obama care, we are going to have to replace President Obama."</em></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/mitt-romneys-remarkable-consistency-on-obama-and-health-care/259089/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by The Atlantic, Romney's position on health care has been very consistent.</p>
<p>GOP Majority Whip tweets "#Obamacareinthreewords --&gt; No new taxes? #FullRepeal".</p>
<p>Mitt Romney has yet to tweet today.</p>
