<p>Bloomberg has polling numbers in today on public opinions toward President Obama's change in immigration policy.</p>
<blockquote><em>Sixty-four percent of likely voters surveyed after Obamaâ€™s June 15 announcement said they agreed with the policy, while 30 percent said they disagreed. <strong>Independents backed the decision by better than a two-to-one margin.</strong></em></blockquote>
<p>The President announced last week he would give the Department of Homeland Security a directive to stop deportation of certain illegal immigrants. His order will cover those under the age of 30, who came to the United States before they were 16, have lived here for at least 5 years, have no criminal record, and are in school.</p>

<p><em>What do you think about the Obama Administration's new immigration policy?</em></p>
