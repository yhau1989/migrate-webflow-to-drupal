<p>Aaron Sorkin is best known for his work depicting the office of the President on <em>The West Wing</em>. Since it's series finale in 2006, he wrote an Oscar-winning screenplay for <em>The Social Network</em>, award-winning screenplay for <em>Moneyball</em>, and a short-lived NBC series <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em>, among other projects. Sorkin returns to television on June 24th, writing a new series on a fictional cable news program in HBO's <em>The Newsroom</em>.</p>

<p>From the looks of the trailer, and apparent to anyone familiar with Sorkin's style, the series will definitely have an idealistic slant. Among discussion: presenting truth-seeking news in a media-saturated environment as opposed to chase ratings or cowing to corporate interests.</p>

<p>Sorkin told the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/arts/television/the-newsroom-aaron-sorkins-return-to-tv.html?pagewanted=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>: “The commoditization of news has created an environment in which we’re told that certain things are important that simply aren’t."</p>

<p>We talk a lot about the mainstream media here, especially the shortcomings and failures to hold the two-party system truly accountable. Sorkin will take this on, and more, as he covers quite possibly the only profession more hated than politicians.</p>

<p>What are your preferred news outlets, or journalists, and why? Which network do you get your television news from? Do you plan on watching <em>The Newsroom</em>?</p>

<p>Here's the trailer:</p>
