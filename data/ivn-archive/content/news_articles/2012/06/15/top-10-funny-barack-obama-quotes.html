<p>As President of the United States of America, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> has his guard up constantly. With the public eye always focused and the media hanging on his every word, we’re surprised he takes the risk to tell jokes in the first place. Rest assured, he has and we are pleased to present you with the top ten giggle-worthy Barack Obama quotes.</p>

<p><strong>"I've been called worse on the basketball court."</strong></p>

<p>The President said this after a particularly vicious round of political boxing, following personal attacks by then-Governor Palin and Rudy Giuliani during the 2008 presidential election.</p>

<p><strong>"Now that's my phone buzzing there. I don't want you to think I'm getting fresh or anything."</strong></p>

<p>As a candidate on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama had this quip while posing for a picture with supporters in Indiana. He apparently felt his phone start to vibrate in his pocket, against which one woman was closely pressed.</p>

<p><strong>"Three words: Vice President Oprah" </strong></p>

<p>When candidate Obama appeared on the<em> Letterman Show</em> to deliver his “Top Ten Campaign Promises” list. This was the #1 item.</p>

<p><strong>"Hilary is not the first politician in Washington to declare 'Mission Accomplished' a little too soon."</strong></p>

<p>Back in the days of the 2007 Democratic primary race, Barack Obama said this on the <em>Tonight Show </em>when asked if he was worried then-rival Hillary Clinton was ahead.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>"I want to especially thank all the members who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight."</strong></p>

<p><span>President Obama delivered this line at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington, DC. It followed a particularly rough few months of Congressional gridlock which saw public approval rating of the legislative branch dip nearly below 10%.</span></p>

<p><strong>"I would have to...investigate more of Bill's dancing abilities, you know, and some of this other stuff before I accurately judge whether he was in fact a brother."</strong></p>

<p>The President's reply when asked if he agreed that former President Bill Clinton was "our first black president."</p>

<p><strong>"It's like I was shot out of a cannon. I'm so overexposed that I make Paris Hilton look like a recluse."</strong></p>

<p>Sen. Obama said this in 2005 as p<span>art of a speech at the Gridiron dinner. If he only knew how much more publicity he’d be getting in the coming years!</span><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>"(The pundits) said you can't win in a year like this with a name like Obama. There was quite a bit of confusion at first, but it did get me free airtime on Al Jazeera."</strong></p>

<p>Safe to say, the surname “Obama” is the most exotic to find itself behind the title President of the United States. The President, at the time a candidate, chose to respond humorously to the prejudices and media focus on his heritage.</p>

<p><strong>"It's been a great ride. But I know how quickly these fads can pass. You all remember the pet rock, the mood ring, Howard Dean."</strong></p>

<p>This was a funny dig at fellow Democratic politician, Howard Dean. Dean is the former Governor of Vermont, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and known widely for his awkward “Dean Scream” outburst at a rally during his 2004 presidential bid.</p>

<p>And finally, what we think is the weirdest and funniest Barack Obama Quote:</p>

<p><strong>"Who is Barack Obama? Contrary to the rumors you have heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father Jor-El to save the Planet Earth. Many of you know that I got my name, Barack, from my father. What you may not know is Barack is actually Swahili for 'That One.' And I got my middle name from somebody who obviously didn't think I'd ever run for president. If I had to name my greatest strength, I guess it would be my humility. Greatest weakness, it's possible that I'm a little too awesome."</strong></p>

<p>President Obama said this at the Al Smith Dinner back in 2008. Clearly, he is alluding himself to the great superhero and Justice Leader, Superman.</p>

<p>Is Obama our superman? That will be for voters to decide in November. All we can hope for now is these Barack Obama quotes have entertained you.</p>
