<p>In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled on the side of three corporations, reversing Montana's 1912 limit on corporate campaign spending. &nbsp;Today's decision not only <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/supreme-courts-montana-decision-strengthens-citizens-united/2012/06/25/gJQA8Vln1V_blog.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">strengthens</a> the 2010 <em>Citizens United</em> decision, but also affirms that it applies to the state of Montana. In defense of the corporations, lead attorney James Bopp <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-courtbre85o0p5-20120625,0,7319337.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;"If Montana can ban core political speech because of Montana's unique characteristics, free speech will be seriously harmed. Speakers will be silenced because of corruption by others over a century ago."</blockquote>
<p>The decision was split along ideological lines, with the 4 liberal justices dissenting, asking the court to reconsider the 2012 ruling because of the huge impact corporate finance has played in the electoral process since the January 2010 ruling.</p>

<p>Justice Breyer wrote the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-1179h9j3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissent</a>, arguing that the political landscape in Montana gives the state a "compelling interest" in limiting independent expenditures by corporations:</p>
<blockquote>Thus, Montana’s experience, like considerable experience elsewhere since the Court’s decision in Citizens United, casts grave doubt on the Court’s supposition that independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to do so.</blockquote>
