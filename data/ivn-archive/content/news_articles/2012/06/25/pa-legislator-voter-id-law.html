<p><a href="http://www.politicspa.com/turzai-voter-id-law-means-romney-can-win-pa/37153/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politics PA</a> has a troubling statement made by Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Mike Turzai (R-Allegheny) at Saturday's Republican State Committee meeting. While addressing the attendees, Rep. Turzai listed off what he feels are Republican victories in the state--and includes the recent Voter ID bill:</p>
<blockquote><em>“Pro-Second Amendment? The Castle Doctrine, it’s done. First pro-life legislation – abortion facility regulations – in 22 years, done. Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.”</em>
