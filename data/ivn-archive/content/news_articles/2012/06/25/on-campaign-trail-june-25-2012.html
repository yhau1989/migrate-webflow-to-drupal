<p><a href="http://ivn.us/2012/06/25/on-campaign-trail-june-25-2012/4fc5babadc693/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="300" src="cloudinary://on-campaign-trail-june-25-2012-44858.jpg" width="300"></a>Today, <strong>President Barack Obama</strong> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-la-pn-obama-begins-campaign-swing-in-mitt-romneys-backyard-20120625,0,7684906.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">heads</a> to New Hampshire to start his two-day tour in "Romney's backyard". He will focus on dueling visions for the economy, an issue that remains at the top of the list for voters nationwide. A campaign spokesman hinted that Obama will compare his approach, starting from the middle class out, to that of Romney, which he characterizes as "top down." After his speech in New Hampshire, he is scheduled to hold three campaign fundraisers in Boston, one of which also features <strong>Democratic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Senate hopeful Elizabeth Warren</strong>.</p>

<p>Obama's campaign office predicts his two-day tour will raise $5 million in fundraising. And with tickets for a roundtable reaching <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/25/obama-biden-hit-the-fund-raising-road/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$40,000</a>, it seems he will have no trouble with this fundraising goal.</p>

<p><strong>Vice President Joe Biden</strong> is doing some fundraising of his own, holding events in both Chicago and Iowa.</p>

<p>This push for campaign cash could be motivated by a recent estimate by Obama's re-election campaign. On Wednesday of last week, Obama's campaign officials <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/us-usa-campaign-obama-idUSBRE85J1G420120620" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted</a> that Romney would outdo the president in fundraising efforts for the month of June, making it the second month in a row that Romney's campaign raised more than Obama and the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>In May, <strong>former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney</strong> raised more than $76.8 million, compared to Obama's $60 million. Obama's team predicts that in June, Romney will top $100 million in fundraising, and partly attributes this success to Super PACs backing the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>Mitt Romney concluded his five-day "Every Town Counts" bus tour late last week, updating his <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2012/06/every-town-counts-bus-tour-day-one-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MittRomney" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mittromney" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>. His increased involvement in social media paid off, as he hit 2 million Facebook Fans last Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Johnson</strong>, the two-term governor of New Mexico, will also appear on the ballot of all 50 states, running as a Libertarian candidate. He recently visited Ventura County in California for an <a href="http://brainstorminonline.com/2012-presidential-candidate-gary-johnson-explains-why-hes-a-better-choice-than-obama-or-romney/" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Bill Frank. And while he was excluded from the national discussion of&nbsp;immigration&nbsp;policy, we've outlined his immigration policy <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/06/22/presidential-candidate-former-new-mexico-gov-gary-johnson-immigration-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Green Party hopeful Jill Stein</strong> <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20120606jill_stein_says_she_has_delegates_for_green_party_nod_for_president/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> she has enough delegates for the official Green Party nomination, stating that after the California primary, she won two-thirds of the delegates allocated. <strong>Roseanne Barr</strong>, who was Stein's opponent for the Green Party nomination, is not deterred, and announced earlier this month that she will form the "Green Tea Party," and run as an independent for her new party. Her main issues, as reported by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/internal-affairs/ci_20824695/internal-affairs-roseanne-barr-forms-green-tea-party" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercury News</a>, are the legalization of marijuana, increased support for Palestine, student loans, and decreased military involvement abroad.</p>
