Our men and women have served in greater numbers than most states since then. And I believe that it's the right thing to do in the 21st century, to allow almost 4 million American citizens to express our will and then to work with the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/us/white-house.htm#r_src=ramp" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House</a> and hopefully President Romney to address this issue."</p>

<p><strong>VP Odds:</strong> <a href="http://www.intrade.com/v4/markets/contract/?contractId=744236" rel="noopener noreferrer">499:1</a></p>

<p>The odds for several of these politicians are slimmer than others in terms of being named as a running mate. However, recalling the 2008 GOP convention, John McCain surprised Americans with his choice of Sarah Palin as his VP candidate. Given the outcome of 2008, we can guess Romney's campaign will be ultra careful and strategic with their choice. As such, it's anyone's guess who Romney will ultimately choose.</p>
