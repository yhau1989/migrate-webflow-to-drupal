<p>In a ruling released on Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a Montana state law banning corporate political expenditures and affirmed their decision on <em>Citizens United</em>, that political contributions fall under First Amendment speech rights. Montana's Democratic Governor Brian Schweitzer and Lieutenant Governor John Bohlinger, a Republican, recently responded to the Court's action invalidating the 100-year-old Corrupt Practices Act. In short, they will continue to challenge the precedent set by the Court's <em>Citizens United</em> ruling and are calling to amend the U.S. Constitution to "make it clear that corporations do not have constitutional rights as if they were people".
