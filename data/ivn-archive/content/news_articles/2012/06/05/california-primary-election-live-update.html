<p><strong>Update: Voter Turnout in L.A. County increases, finds preliminary sample

7:05pm&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>"If predictions of a historic low in California's voter turnout comes true today, then L.A. County might be <a href="http://www.kcet.org/news/ballotbrief/voting/voter-turnout-in-la-county-increases.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">bucking the trend</a>."</p>

<p><strong>Update: Republican Bill Berryhill Makes Over 10,000 Calls in Final Push</strong></p>

<p><strong>6:52pm</strong></p>

<p>Bill Berryhill, a Republican candidate running to represent State Senate District 5, has been hard at work with his campaign team.</p>

<p>According to his campaign:&nbsp;We have made 10,000 calls to voters from our Stockton HQ every day since Friday.</p>

[caption id="attachment_24635" align="aligncenter" width="576" caption="Volunteers for Bill Berryhill spend the day making calls to get out the vote. June 5, 2012."][/caption]<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Callers.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="427" src="cloudinary://Callers.jpg" width="576"></a></p>

<p>Those calls will come in handy as this is the race to watch for independents and partisan voters alike.&nbsp;The race for SD 5 is arguably one of the most important CA legislative contests this year, as it is a top target for both Democrats and Republicans in the state. The outcome of this race will be a key factor in whether or not Senate Democrats reach the 2/3 majority needed to raise taxes without Republican consent in CA's upper house.</p>

<p>The difference in voter registration numbers between the two major parties is very slim. Over 16 % of those registered to vote in the district have self identified as "No Party Preference" or other- so they'll be playing a critical role in tonight's results.</p>

<p>Here's a look at a previous opinion editorial and Q&amp;A from Berryhill:</p>

<p><strong>Update: Polls Close in Wisconsin</strong></p>

<p><strong>7:13pm</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong> National attention is on Wisconsin tonight as they vote on Gov. Scott Walker's recall. The polls officially closed at 9pm.</p>

<p>Major news networks are saying it is too close to call, with exit polls showing a dead heat.</p>

<p>For California voters, there is a little over one hour left to get to the polls.</p>

<p><strong>Update: California's Open Primary Running Smoothly&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>4:15pm</strong></p>

<p>Looks like California's first go at our new top two open primary system is going smoothly. None of the confusion or glitches open primary foes once alleged has yet to occur. Yes, it seems voters are well informed and carrying on like years past.</p>

<p>Check out this article from the Sacramento Bee with more information and commentary from CA's Secretary of State: <a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2012/06/no-glitches-for-californias-new-top-two-system-of-voting.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>No glitches for California's new 'Top Two' system of voting</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Update: Party partisanship increases as party membership shrinks</strong></p>

<p><strong>4:07pm</strong></p>

<p>"The percentage of Americans who call themselves independents has hit a 75-year high, and Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart." -- <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2018356621_electorate05.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center</a></p>

<p>This is a national poll but certainly applies to California and the primaries. The hyper-partisan are remaining in the two parties even as membership shrinks and disaffected members re-register as independents.</p>

<p>(Bob)</p>

<p><strong>
Update: Dan Walters says California's primary election stakes are minimal</strong></p>

<p><strong>4:05pm</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/06/05/4538343/dan-walters-californias-primary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walters sees</a> open primaries as untested as to whether they will decrease polarization. But rather than the stakes being minimal, open primaries actually make the primary more important because only two candidates will meet in the general, not several. So much of the real competition is now shifting to the primary.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Intra-Party Battles to Hurt California Democrats?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3:53pm</strong></p>

<p>Do you think the sheer cost of running a campaign in today's open primary system is going to hurt Democrats?</p>

<p>Apparently, Democratic insiders aren't all together excited that several intra-party fights won't see a resolve at the end of tonight, and they are expecting the ongoing contests to suck up millions of dollars from party funds. As many have predicted, there will be up to six tough and costly congressional races between Democratic candidates that are carrying over to November. This is not seen as a plus for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is desperately looking to pickup seats in California as part of its larger effort to regain the house from Republicans.</p>

<p>Here's an article from the National Journal that provides race specific details: <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/magazine/california-democrats-family-feuds-20120531" rel="noopener noreferrer">California's Family Feuds</a></p>

<p>Because of California's new election rules, the top two vote getters from tonight's primary (regardless of party) will advance to the general runoff. In a true blue state like California that equates to plenty of intra-party squabbling, and not just at the congressional level- as similar situations are likely to occur in several races at the state level also. Republicans won't be affected in quite the same way, because quite frankly there just aren't that many in California.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Rolling Stone Totally Misses The Point About an Open Primary</strong></p>

<p><strong>3:00pm</strong></p>

<p>Using California's Senate race as an example, Rolling Stone has a blog post declaring, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/californias-push-for-more-moderate-candidates-totally-backfires-20120605" rel="noopener noreferrer">"California's Push for More Moderate Candidates Totally Backfires"</a>, yet admittedly cites "the extremely limited polling on the race" and contends a likely second place finish for Orly Taitz, of birther fame.</p>

<p>Only link to said "polling" is to a dated Ballot Access blog post edited by vocal Prop 14 opponent, Richard Winger.</p>

<p>No mention of any other races accompany the blog post. Polls do not close for another 5 hours.</p>

<p>The author does at least, throw in a key point, albeit deep within a poorly researched post:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Also a possibility: that the Republicans don't get a candidate in there at all."</em></blockquote>
<div>As an electoral reform designed to enfranchise the masses, not just hyper-partisan party-line voters and candidates, where is California's Open Primary backfiring?</div>

<p><strong>Update: No on Prop 28 Largely Funded Out-of-State
</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>Opponents of the ballot initiative concerning term limits, <em>No on Prop 28</em>, were heavily outspent by <em>Yes on Prop 28</em>, according to <a href="http://maplight.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">MapLight.org</a>.</p>

<p>What is even more interesting?</p>

<p>Nearly all funding for No on Prop 28 came from outside California.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Possible reason for low voter turnout in California</strong></p>

<p><strong>1:27pm</strong></p>

<p>In the previous update below my colleague, Lucy Ma, wonders why voter turnout is so low in such a groundbreaking year for California elections. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/primary-turnout-california-new-jersey-montana-new-mexico-south-dakota_n_1571155.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPo's got</a> this possible explanation:</p>
<blockquote><em>'A key reason for voters' lack of enthusiasm is the irrelevance of the top-ticket race: The Democratic presidential primary is not contested, and Mitt Romney decisively clinched the GOP nomination when he won last week in Texas.</em>

<em>Voter disinterest is also driven by the lateness of the California primary, which was pushed back this year from its previous date in March, and the absence of hotly competitive Senate races or controversial ballot propositions.'</em></blockquote>
<p>Come on voters. Local and state politics are just as important as national politics. The only difference is there's less money in local and state elections, fewer geographically and economically disparate interests, and fewer voters-- which all means your vote and your voice<em> matter more</em> and your activism and electoral engagement has <em>a bigger impact</em>!</p>

<p>...on that ballot proposition note, I wonder if any exit pollers are asking voters whether or not they smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Voter Turnout Continues to be Slow</strong></p>

<p><strong>1:11pm</strong></p>

<p>I'm starting to think Field Poll's voter turnout projections are even a bit high at 35%. When I showed up at my polling place in downtown Sacramento this morning, around 9 am, it certainly looked like we were well on our way to setting a record new low for voter turnout. What gives? Today marks the first time Independent voters, and partisan voters alike got to cast a vote on the same ballot. Shouldn't equal ballot access and a crucial presidential election year be enough to push folks to the polls?</p>

<p>We are looking at a record setting number of voters that have opted for absentee ballots instead this year- my fingers are crossed that that's the cause for the less than stellar turnout at the polls this morning.</p>

<p>In other north state news:</p>

<p>Republicans are making the final push to get out the vote for Assewmblywoman Beth Gaines who is running in Assembly District 6, she picked up a challenger from the right earlier this year (the far right), Andy Pugno. Yes, Andy Pugno as in the author and former lead defender of Proposition 8. Ironically, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request from Prop 8 backers for a rehearing earlier this morning. I wonder if it'll have any affect on his race.</p>

<p><strong>Update: The effect of redistricting on California's 2012 Primary</strong></p>

<p><strong>12:52pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p>

<p>The top two open primary isn't the only big change in California's 2012 electoral landscape, as <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/47691683" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC notes</a>, there's also some very heavily redrawn districts in the Golden State this year:</p>
<blockquote>'The changes could set the stage for head-to-head face-offs between longtime incumbents, potentially from the same party, in November after a decade of remarkable stability in the state's majority Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives.

That stability was a result of the deliberate creation of electoral districts to favor incumbents, a process known as gerrymandering. In 263 elections from 2002 to 2010, only one congressional seat changed political party.

"California was totally locked in on this gerrymandered map," said Kyle Kondik, political analyst at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.

This time the state put a non-partisan citizens commission in charge of most of the redrawing of congressional districts. The number of districts did not change, but the boundaries were adjusted to reflect population shifts since the previous national census in 2000.'</blockquote>
<p>The article also notes some significant demographic changes as a result:</p>
<blockquote>'Redistricting has created a "huge leap" in the number of districts with more than 50 percent minority voters, Mitchell said. Majority-Hispanic legislative districts have increased from 19 to 29, and California now has the only majority-Asian district in the continental United States.'</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:&nbsp;Chad Condit's Statement on His Campaign</strong></p>

<p>Chad Condit, independent candidate in California Congressional District 10, speaks out about his campaign on election day:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I'm feeling good. We ran a great campaign and I have great people helping me. The best thing about our campaign is our message is right. It resonates with the people in the district. A Congressman should be a congressman that represents the people, not the parties, and the people of the Central Valley recognize that. I feel good, the message is right, and we'll see how the day goes. The people of the Central Valley are in control, so we will let them decide, but we're working hard to get out the vote today." &nbsp;-Chad Condit</em></blockquote>

<p>One of the top races to keep an eye on today is in Assembly District 50. After a lively Democratic State Convention, Betsy Butler won the endorsement of California's Democratic Party.

<p><strong>Update: Voters React to New Top-Two Primary System</strong></p>

<p><strong>11:30 am</strong></p>

<p>Despite changes to the appearance of the ballot in today's open primary, today's Field Poll reveals that voters are comfortable with the changes they will find on the ballot. The Sacramento Bee reports on the findings:</p>
<blockquote><em>The poll found 74 percent of voters do not think the change will confuse them, while 21 percent said it will.</em>

<em>Of those who said they expect the format to be confusing, just 5 percent believe they will be very confused.</em></blockquote>

<p><strong>Update: Predictions on Voter Turnout</strong></p>

<p><strong>11:15am</strong></p>

<p>Numbers from a Field Poll released today indicate that voter turnout could set a record low for a presidential primary in California, with a predicted 35% of registered voters participating. According to the<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/06/05/4538333/field-poll-predicting-low-turnout.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sacramento Bee</a>, the previous record for low voter turnout was 41.9% in 1996.&nbsp;Similarly, the presidential candidates during the 1996 election (Bill Clinton and Bob Dole) had likely secured the nomination, decreasing voter interest in the presidential primary.
