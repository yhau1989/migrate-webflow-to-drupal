<p>Today is the last chance for candidates to try and get out the vote before Tuesday's primary election. June 5th&nbsp;marks California's first top two open primary in which all candidates regardless of party preference will be listed on the same ballot.</p>

<p>Campaigns are using this important time to energize the base and make the last push in getting voters to turnout at the polls tomorrow.&nbsp;This election cycle saw a huge boost in the use of social media as a campaign tool. Candidates across the state have been avidly utilizing Facebook, and Twitter in addition to more traditional tactics such as precinct walking and phone banking.&nbsp;Here's a look at what some of the candidates in key races across the state are doing to reach out to voters.</p>

<p><strong>In Assembly District 8:</strong></p>

<p>Peter Tateishi, a Republican candidate for the seat, has taken to his Facebook account to recruit volunteers for his phone banking efforts that continue all day today and extend into tomorrow.</p>

<p>Barbara Ortega, who is also a Republican candidate running in the district, has been active on social media today reminding voters to participate and offering tips on how best to locate their polling locations.</p>

<p><strong>In Assembly District 57:</strong></p>

<p>Ian Calderon, a Democratic candidate who is in a three way contest to place in the top two tomorrow, has been tweeting live updates regarding his get out the vote efforts.</p>

<p><strong>In the race for U.S. Senate:</strong></p>

<p>Due in part to California's new open primary system, the race for U.S. Senate has become extremely crowded with 23 challengers hoping to replace &nbsp;U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein this November. Polls have shown that Feinstein continues to maintain a wide lead over the rest of the pack who must compete for a chance to place second tomorrow in order to qualify for the general runoff.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Emken, the CA Republican Party endorsed candidate, has been hitting the airwaves and participating in interviews all day in an effort to secure her position as the leading challenger to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein.</p>
