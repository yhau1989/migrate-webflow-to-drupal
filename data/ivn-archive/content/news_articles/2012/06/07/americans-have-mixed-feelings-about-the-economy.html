<p>According to the latest from <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/155084/Less-Half-Friday-Jobs-Report-Negative.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Business%20-%20Economy%20-%20Jobs%20-%20Unemployment%20-%20USA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a>, most Americans didn't think the last jobs report was that bad. Let's recall last week's jobs report: For the month of May, 69,000 jobs were created, and the unemployment rate rose to 8.2%.</p>

<p>The Gallup poll shows that when asked about last month's jobs report, less than half surveyed saw the jobs and unemployment numbers as "negative" with almost as many with "mixed" feelings towards the jobs report.</p>

<p>When we asked independent voters to describe the economy in one word, however, we got a different response:</p>

<p>It seems from the collection of words, my favorite being "Craigslist", independents aren't too happy with the direction of the economy.</p>

<p>What do you think? Was last month's jobs report positive, negative, or do you have mixed feelings? What word would you use to describe the current state of the economy?</p>
