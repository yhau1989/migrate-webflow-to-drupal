<p><strong>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</strong> - US Rep. Justin Amash has introduced a bill that seeks to level the playing field for all candidates running for Congress.</p>

<p>The bill requires states to impose the same ballot access requirements on all candidates, regardless of party nomination status or affiliation.&nbsp;It also eliminates straight-ticket voting for congressional elections.</p>

<p>"Laws should not advantage particular political parties or discriminate against candidates who choose not to affiliate with a party,” <a href="https://www.sentinel-standard.com/news/20190313/amash-introduces-bill-to-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amash said</a>. “'The Ballot Fairness Act' helps equalize the treatment of candidates so elections will be fairer and voters will have more options.”</p>

<p>The bill leaves it up to the states to decide how to level the ballot access requirements, whether that means a nonpartisan primary system for all candidates or new signature requirements for party-nominated candidates.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the constitution gives states the authority to decide how their elections are conducted. So if the bill manages to pass both chambers of Congress and is signed into law by President Trump, it seems likely a lawsuit will be filed to challenge the bill.</p>

<p>Still, it raises an important issue: Shouldn't elections treat everyone involved fairly and equally?</p>

<p>Check out the complete bill here:</p>
