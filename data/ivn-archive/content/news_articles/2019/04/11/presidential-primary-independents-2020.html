<p>It is no secret that both parties control the presidential nomination process.</p>

<p>But what is less-known is that taxpayers, not the parties, fund the primary election.</p>

<p>So, why wouldn’t every voter, regardless of party, get to participate?</p>

<p>That’s why the Independent Voter Project (IVP) <a href="https://independentvoterproject.org/updates/california-presidential-primary-is-unconstitutional-gonzalez-fletcher-bill-is-not-a-solution" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded to another partisan “solution” this week</a> to California’s <a href="https://ivn.us/2019/03/27/impending-disaster-californias-confusing-presidential-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">confusing (and taxpayer funded) semi-closed presidential primary</a>, which would continue to shortchange over 5.6 million independent voters.</p>

<p>Instead, IVP calls for a simple, nonpartisan solution: a public presidential primary ballot that would allow any voter, regardless of party, to vote for any candidate.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="630" src="cloudinary://presidential-primary-independents-2020-13787.png" width="1200"></p>

<p>Bottom Line: Let the parties keep their own ballots. Let the parties exclude or include whoever they want. Let the parties decide their own rules of nomination.</p>

<p>BUT, give every voter their fundamental right to participate at every stage of the taxpayer-funded public election process.</p>

<p>The question is: Will state politicians step up this time to defend everyone’s voting rights? Stay tuned for more updates on this big issue.</p>

<p><strong>By Independent Voter Project</strong></p>

<p>The 2016 presidential primaries in California didn’t go smoothly. The election was marred by widespread confusion and frustration as millions of voters had to navigate a complex and restrictive semi-closed primary process. As a result, they were completely disenfranchised by the process. Now, this is the Independent Voter Project’s #1 reform priority going into 2020.</p>
