<div>
<div><span>Kitty Kurth joins T.J. O'Hara to discuss Joe Biden's potential presidential run, how he might be challenged, and by whom. They also discuss a few political issues that are specific to Chicago but that have national implications: Jussie Smollett's prosecution (or lack thereof) and the mayoral race that was the first ever contested between two black women, Lori Lightfoot and&nbsp;Toni Preckwinkle.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Kitty is the President of Kurth Lampe Worldwide. She's a public relations and political strategist of national note.&nbsp; She has worked on eight Presidential campaigns, including the two winning Clinton/Gore and Obama/Biden tickets. In that capacity, she’s served in the roles of press secretary, campaign manager, and communications adviser. In addition, she’s worked with speakers at the Democratic National Convention&nbsp;at every convention since 1996&nbsp;to help them deliver their messages more effectively.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Kitty provides unique insight into all of the issues as she has long-standing political relationships and personal friendships with most of the relevant parties, including Joe Biden, Kim Foxx, and Jessie Jackson.&nbsp; She also provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse of what transpired in 2016 when then-Vice President Biden decided not to run.</span></div>

<div><span>It's a show you won't want to miss.</span></div>
