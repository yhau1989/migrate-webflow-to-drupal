<p><em>Easter Egg Roll 2018</em></p>

<p>That's the official year the egg roll began but historians say informal festivities began with egg-rolling parties under President Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>The egg roll became so popular&nbsp;that President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill that banned the rolling of eggs on Capitol grounds, citing landscape concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>War Brings Pause and Venue Change</strong></h2>
<p>The egg roll was paused due to World War I and World War II.</p>

<p>From 1917 to 1920 and from 1943 to 1945 the egg roll tradition took a back seat to the more pressing issues of peace. Although in 1917 the roll happened but it was forced to the U.S. Capitol and the National Zoo.</p>

<p>President Harding brought the egg roll back to the White House in 1921, but it got canceled again starting in 1942 because of World War II.</p>

<p>President Truman declined to restart it, citing food shortages. It wasn’t until his successor, President Eisenhower, took office in 1953 that the hunt was reinstituted.</p>

<h2><strong>Wooden Easter Egg Tradition</strong></h2>
<p>The commemorative wooden Easter eggs began in 1981, an idea instituted by First Lady Nancy Reagan.</p>

<p><em>2019 Wooden Easter Egg</em></p>

<p>The tradition became a keepsake cherished by guests that donned the signature of the President and First Lady.</p>

<p>Thousands of colorful wooden Easter eggs are making the journey from Maine to the White House for this year’s annual White House Easter Egg Roll.</p>

<p>For the second year in a row, Maine Wood Concepts, a wood turning factory located in New Vineyard, Maine, will turn out about 100,000 birch Easter eggs to meet the exacting specifications of the White House Historical Association.</p>
<h2><strong>The 2019 Commemorative Egg</strong></h2>
<p>As the annual White House Easter Egg Roll is celebrated on Monday, another annual tradition is also being celebrated.</p>
<p>The Commemorative Egg announcement.</p>
<p>While the beloved egg roll involves some 74,000 eggs on the South Lawn, the Commemorative Egg is a singular offering.</p>
<p>Each year, the First Lady of the United States receives this gift from America’s egg farmers. The tradition dates back to 1977.</p>
