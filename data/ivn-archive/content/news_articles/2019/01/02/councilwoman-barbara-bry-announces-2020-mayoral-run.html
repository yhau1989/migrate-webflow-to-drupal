<p>San Diego, Calif.- Councilwoman Barbara Bry has made it official, she's running for mayor.</p>

<p>Bry's campaign sent a <a href="https://barbarabry.com/update/barbara-bry-announces-candidacy-for-mayor-of-san-diego" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> and created a website, <a href="https://barbarabry.com/about/why" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbara Bry Mayor 2020.</a></p>

<p>On her website Bry noted,&nbsp; "I will bring leadership that puts solutions for San Diegans first, prioritizes fiscal discipline, stands up to the special interests, treats all residents and communities fairly, and creates comprehensive solutions to long-standing problems."</p>

<p>Bry is the first Democrat to announce her candidacy.&nbsp;<a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressman Scott Peters</a> and <a href="https://a78.asmdc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assemblyman Todd Gloria</a> are expected to announce their intentions to run in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><em>Barbary Bry Campaign Video</em></p>
<h3><strong>Business Owner, Decision Maker</strong></h3>
<p>Bry's video touts her many accomplishments including being a successful business owner and her willingness to make the tough decisions to move the city forward. "I'm the only candidate who started a company, had to make payroll, created jobs in the private sector and I have brought that perspective to city hall." Bry continued, "Having a leader who is able to make a decision is very important."</p>
<h3><strong>The Female Factor</strong></h3>
<p>Bry is expected to be the only female candidate running for mayor and if she were to win, would be the third woman to lead the city. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Golding" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Golding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Connor_(California_politician)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maureen O'Connor</a>&nbsp;were the other two.</p>

<p>The female distinction will likely become a talking point for the campaign. In her video, Bry notes, "Because of my background, I had a lot of doors that were open to me that are not open to people in San Diego, and I want to make sure that they get the same opportunities that I had."</p>
<h3><strong>March Primary</strong></h3>
<p>Some may consider the announcement early, but it's important to note that California is moving up its primary from June to March in 2019.</p>

<p>It's a move designed to increase the influence of the country's most populous state in deciding presidential candidates. By the June California primary elections in 2016, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were already their parties' presumptive nominees.</p>
