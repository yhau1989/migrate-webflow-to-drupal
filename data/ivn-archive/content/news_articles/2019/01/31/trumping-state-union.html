<p><b>SAN DIEGO, CALIF.</b> -<span>&nbsp;</span>Political pettiness has been temporarily suspended and the State of the Union will be given on February 5, 2019.<span>&nbsp;</span>From its original purpose under Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, which was to <i>“give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he (the President) shall judge necessary and expedient,”</i> it has degenerated into an exercise of political self-indulgence and simply bad TV.</p>
<p>What would happen if its show biz aspect was put aside for a straight-forward overview of where we are as a Nation?<span>&nbsp;</span>The following is a <i>very</i> tongue-in-cheek version of how that SOTU address might sound.</p>
<p>“My damn Speaker… Sorry!<span>&nbsp;</span>I meant <i>Madame</i> Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:<span>&nbsp;</span>This is my third… and some of you hope last... State of the Union address.</p>
<p>“Normally, I’d tell you how great I am… so incredibly great… and how much we are winning.<span>&nbsp;</span>It’s been unbelievable!<span>&nbsp; </span>And believe me when I tell you we’d be winning even more… a lot, lot more… if it wasn’t for the deep state and Democrat obstructionists!<span>&nbsp;</span>But my staff tells me that the State of the Union’s ratings are down, so I’m going to change things up to try to rebuild the audience.<span>&nbsp;</span>After all, Barack praised himself and blamed the Republicans for eight straight years, and even his SOTU ratings tanked.<span>&nbsp;</span>So, I’ve got to do something different.</p>

<p>“First, I’m not using any human props this time to draw sympathy for my cause.<span>&nbsp;</span>I didn’t invite any guests with sad stories that I could exploit.<span>&nbsp;</span>That trick seems to have run its course.</p>
<p>“I’m also not going to try to deliver applause lines because I know that Nancy is going to be sitting on her hands and making faces rather than jumping up and clapping like a trained seal like she did when Barack would even clear his throat.<span>&nbsp;</span>Go back and look at the tapes.<span>&nbsp;</span>It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p>“That being said, I wish Paul Ryan would have been half as supportive as Nancy.<span>&nbsp;</span>Mr. Goody Two-Shoes didn’t want to offend anyone by being even remotely overzealous on my behalf.<span>&nbsp;</span>Maybe if he had I wouldn’t still be asking for my wall.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, the wall was one of my biggest campaign promises.<span>&nbsp;</span>I knew it was over-the-top and that Mexico would never pay for it, but it became a rallying cry for my base.<span>&nbsp;</span>I have to deliver on it at some level or I’ll be a one-term president.<span>&nbsp;</span>Nancy, would you please sit down and stop applauding?</p>
<p>“And believe me when I tell you that most campaign promises are nothing more than hot air designed to separate the American people from their money and their votes.<span>&nbsp;</span>But there are some promises that stick with people, and you have to deliver them.<span>&nbsp;F</span>or me, it’s the wall.<span>&nbsp;</span>For my predecessor, it was health care reform.</p>
<p>“We don’t always deliver <i>exactly</i> what we promise, but I need some kind of wall.<span>&nbsp;</span>It’s not like Obamacare put $2,500 in every American’s pocket or allowed you to keep your plan or your doctor as promised, but at least it was something.<span>&nbsp;</span>Besides, you all supported a wall or fence of some kind before I took office.</p>
<p>“You have to admit, some things have gotten better since I took office.&nbsp;The economy is doing much better, unemployment is way down: North Korea isn’t testing missiles every other day, and the JV team in Syria isn’t beheading people on TV.&nbsp;Then again, I’m not sure our climate is improving or that I’m setting the best example for our kids. Things have been a little ‘stormy’ at times.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is that none of us are perfect.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking for a Nobel Peace Prize.<span>&nbsp;</span>I just want to be treated fairly.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, here’s the deal… and no one negotiates deals better than me.<span>&nbsp; </span>That, I can tell you!</p>
<p>“I’ll stop making things up to distract the public if you will, too.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll stop denying things I’ve said if you’ll stop pretending you didn’t support my positions before I beat Hillary… and I beat her easily… maybe the easiest victory in history.<span>&nbsp;</span>I’ll even stop badgering the press if they’ll stop badgering me.<span>&nbsp;</span>It’s called quid pro quo.<span>&nbsp;</span>You can read about it in my great book, ‘The Art of the Deal.’</p>
<p>“Speaking of books, for those of you who keep bringing up emoluments… the State Department authorized the purchase of $70,000 worth of my predecessor’s book, ‘Dreams From My Father,’ in 2011.<span>&nbsp; </span>Crooked Hillary was secretary of state at the time.<span>&nbsp;</span>Of course, her staff got immunity deals and the opportunity to destroy cell phones and computers while I got Bob Mueller and my corrupt buddies got prosecuted.<span>&nbsp;</span>There’s just no justice.”</p>
<p>[The president looks to an aide and asks, “How am I doing?”<span>&nbsp;</span>The aide responds that the SOTU’s ratings are climbing.<span>&nbsp;</span>The president nods his head and looks into the camera with a broad smile.]</p>
<p>“I think we’re done here!</p>
<p>“Thank you, and God bless America.”</p>
<p>[Notification is given to the networks to cue up the Democrat’s negative response, which was prepared well in advance of the President’s address.]</p>
