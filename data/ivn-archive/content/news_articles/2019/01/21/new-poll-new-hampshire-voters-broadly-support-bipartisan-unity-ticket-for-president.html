<p>In just over a year, voters in New Hampshire will participate in the first in the nation presidential&nbsp;primary and play an instrumental role in narrowing the field of candidates for the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Unite America polled New Hampshire voters in December 2018 to get their views on the issues they care about, both major political parties, and the potential of a &nbsp;bipartisan “Unity Ticket” in 2020.</p>

<p>Here’s what we found:</p>

<p>1.<strong>&nbsp;A majority of voters (61%) support the idea of a bipartisan, “Unity Ticket” for president and vice-president in 2020.
</strong></p>

<p>Specifically, we asked voters: “How supportive would you be if your preferred presidential candidate chose a running mate of the opposite party to create a ‘Unity ticket’ for president and vice-president that could unite our divided country?”</p>

<p>We found support among 67% of Democrats, 65% of independents, and 51% of Republicans.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>More voters view political dysfunction (74%) and our disunity (68%) as a threat to America than any other major issue.</strong></p>

<p>“Our dysfunctional political system, including the role of money in politics” was viewed as a “severe” threat by 50% of voters –– including 41% of Republicans, 56% of Democrats, and 53% of independents. An additional 24% of voters view political dysfunction as a “large” threat.</p>

<p>The threat of dysfunction and disunity outpaces eight other issues, including terrorism, the national debt, or climate change.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>A plurality of voters (39%) do not feel well-represented by either major political party.</strong></p>

<p>Among those who feel politically homeless include 52% of independents, 44% of Republicans, and 17% of Democrats.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>A super-majority of voters (84%) support a specific package of reforms to increase accountability, competition, and participation in our political system.</strong></p>

<p>Specifically, we polled voters on a four-part proposal to: four proposals to establish term limits in Congress, end the practice of partisan gerrymandering, force all Super PACs to disclose their donors, and make Election Day a national holiday.</p>

<p>Support spanned the political spectrum, including 74% of Republicans, 91% of Democrats, and 87% of independents.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>A majority of voters are open to supporting an independent presidential candidate in 2020 (56%) –– including 42% of Republicans, 58% of Democrats, and 68% of independents.</strong></p>

<p>Our conclusion: Alienated by both parties and most concerned about political dysfunction, a majority of New Hampshire voters are ready for a “Unity Ticket” ticket in 2020 that can heal our divisions and fix our political system.</p>
