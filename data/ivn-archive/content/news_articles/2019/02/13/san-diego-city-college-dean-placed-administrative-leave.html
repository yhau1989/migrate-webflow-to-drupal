<p>Matilda Chavez acknowledged she is acting in Gerald's position,&nbsp;“I’m asking for patience from people on the campus,” Chavez told the City Times, “I am reading everything before I sign it.</p>
<h3><strong>Legal Action</strong></h3>
<p>It's not clear what led to Gerald being placed on leave although IVN has received copy of a lawsuit filed on behalf of three Hispanic professors last year. The suit names the College Board of Trustees and Gerald. The Plaintiffs claim Gerald engaged in among other things: Retaliation, Civil Rights Violations, and Harassment of employees.</p>

<p>There is currently a motion to dismiss the lawsuit which is pending in Federal court.</p>

<h3><strong>Leadership Lost</strong></h3>
<p>A source who wishes to remain confidential and has first hand knowledge of the situation said, "Under&nbsp; Gerald's 'leadership' we lost dozens of classes, hundreds of students did not get degrees or certificates. She destroyed that Radio, TV, Film program. People who work there probably won't go public out of fear."</p>

<p>Under the umbrella of the Arts, Humanities and Communications is the Radio, TV, Film program which has seen been decimated by cuts.</p>
