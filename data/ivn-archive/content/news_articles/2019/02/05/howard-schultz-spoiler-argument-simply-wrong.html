-->
<p>Former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd-Whitman and former Nebraska US Senator Bob Kerrey <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/opinions/howard-schultz-what-independent-candidates-need-todd-whitman-kerrey/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote an essay</a> for CNN.com titled,&nbsp;<em>What Howard Schultz -- Or Any Independent -- Needs to Have a Real Shot</em>. It refers to <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/08/presidential-debates-new-rules-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my litigation</a> with the Federal Election Commission over presidential debate access rules:</p>
<p><em>"The two parties control a non-profit called the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), which has set rules that have effectively barred an independent from debating for more than a quarter-century. The one exception was Ross Perot, when in 1992 he was invited by both the Bush and Clinton campaigns to participate. Perot&nbsp;received 19%&nbsp;of the final popular vote in 1992, and a shocked CPD kept him out of the 1996 debates and then raised the bar for debate access.</em></p>
<p><em>The&nbsp;current requirement&nbsp;is 15% support in five polls taken shortly before the first debate. Perot, who&nbsp;polled at only 8%&nbsp;in September of 1992, would not have qualified. Neither, since the first TV debate almost 60 years ago, would any American unaffiliated with either the Republican or Democratic Party...</em></p>
<p><em>[...]</em></p>
<p><em>In 2014, LPF filed a lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission, which oversees the CPD, and on February 1, 2017, the US District Court for the District of Columbia&nbsp;ruled against the FEC. In a harshly worded opinion, Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote that the FEC had "acted arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to law." It was&nbsp;the first&nbsp;successful&nbsp;court challenge&nbsp;to the rules of presidential debates.</em></p>
<p><em>Judge Chutkan told the FEC that it had to reconsider LPF's claims against the CPD and issue a new decision consistent with the court's ruling. The FEC refused, and a&nbsp;second round&nbsp;of litigation ensued.</em></p>
<p><em>A final ruling in the case still has not been issued. Time is running out if Americans are going to get a chance to vote for a contender other than a Republican and a Democrat in 2020."</em></p>
<p>There is another critical point to consider. Let’s assume the debate access rules are changed to allow Howard Schultz or another “<span lang="DE">centrist independent</span>” candidate to compete for president on a level playing field.&nbsp;Then the arguments that Schultz will be a spoiler are simply wrong. Here’s why.</p>

<p>Indeed, Jill Stein and Ralph Nader did hurt the Democratic candidate because everyone who voted for them would have otherwise voted Democratic. That is not the case for a candidate like Schultz who will attract votes from those who normally vote for Republicans, Democrats, or from those who would not have voted at all.</p>

<p>This is precisely what happened with H.&nbsp;<span lang="ES-TRAD">Ross Perot</span>&nbsp;in the 1992 election<span lang="DE">.&nbsp;</span>It is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ross-perot-myth/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a myth</a> that Perot “<span lang="FR">spoiled</span>”&nbsp;<span lang="DE">George H. W. Bush</span>’s chances to beat Bill Clinton. The facts are that 36% of Perot’s votes would have gone to Bush, 36% to Clinton, and 24% would not have voted at all<span lang="DE">.</span></p>

<p>It is impossible to predict who Schultz will “<span lang="FR">spoil</span>” because there are too many unknown variables. For example, we don’t know who will receive the Democratic nomination and what his/her positions will be vis-à<span lang="DE">-vis</span><span lang="DE">&nbsp;</span><span lang="DE">Trump.</span><span lang="DE">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In fact, there is a compelling argument that the centrist will “<span lang="FR">spoil</span>” neither the Democrat nor Republican candidate. If the independent dropped out and his/her votes were redistributed, the math makes it unlikely the outcome would change. For example, for Bush to have beaten Clinton, he would have had to capture 70% of Perot’s vote. Highly unlikely.</p>

<p>While I will not be endorsing any candidate for president due to the nonpartisan nature of my work and our ongoing litigation, I think the most beneficial aspect of the “<span lang="DE">Schultz</span>” candidacy is that it could nullify the extremes, both during the campaign and after the winner governs.</p>

<p>Again, looking at the Perot experience, his candidacy ultimately facilitated a balanced budget after Clinton became president.</p>
