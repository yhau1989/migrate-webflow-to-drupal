<p>Kennebec County Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy ordered Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap to implement ranked choice voting for the June primary elections Wednesday, not long after <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/30/ranked-choice-voting-cmte-to-file-injuction-against-maine-secretary-of-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunlap reportedly told lawmakers he had no intention of doing so</a>.</p>

<p>Maine voters <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/05/ranked-choice-voting-appear-maine-ballots/" rel="noopener noreferrer">successfully acted</a> against the legislature's attempt to delay and repeal ranked choice voting by getting a people's veto on the June primary ballot. This means ranked choice voting would be used in statewide primary elections while Mainers also vote on repealing a law passed by state lawmakers that would kill the voting reform.</p>

<p>There was significant doubt whether or not Dunlap -- who has opposed ranked choice voting -- would honor the will of voters, especially after he reportedly told the Democratic Caucus in Maine that he would not be implementing it for the primary.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Committee for Ranked Choice Voting</a> requested a court-ordered injunction to force RCV's implementation. RCV advocates along with eight candidates for Governor, Congress, and the Maine Legislature, argued that confusion over what voting method would be used would cause "irreparable harm" to the election process.</p>

<p>Justice Murphy agreed.</p>

<p>“The uncertainty that halting the ranked-choice voting implementation process at this late date is significant. Clarity, stability and public confidence are essential to ensure the legitimacy of Maine elections,” writes Murphy.</p>

<p>State lawmakers continue to fight the implementation of ranked choice voting as another complaint was <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/04/judge-orders-state-to-use-ranked-choice-voting-for-june-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed Wednesday to stop the will of Maine voters</a>. However, as a result of Murphy's order, Maine will officially be the first state in the nation to use ranked choice voting for statewide elections.</p>
