<p>Welcome to our weekly post, Independent Action, where we let you know the important moves Independent candidates and organizations made over the past week.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://gov.alaska.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Governor Bill Walker of Alaska</a>&nbsp;</b>passed HB339, a bill “that&nbsp;gives parents and teachers certainty that Alaska schools will be funded every year.” You can find his full statement on the passing of the bill below.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.craigodear.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig O’Dear</a></b><a href="https://gov.alaska.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">,</a><b>&nbsp;</b>an Independent candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri, received some publicity from the Kansas City Star. The author writes in her opinion piece, “O’Dear is right about where we are, and correct, too,&nbsp;that this&nbsp;model mandates&nbsp;that&nbsp;all political adversaries&nbsp;be&nbsp;cast as not simply mistaken&nbsp;but evil. One of his obstacles, though, beyond Hawley and McCaskill, who&nbsp;are in what’s expected to be one of the closest races in the country, is that their contest may well&nbsp;decide control of the Senate.”</p>

<p><a href="https://noahdyer.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Noah Dyer</strong></a>, an Independent gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, released a video called Conservative Cannabis.</p>

<p>According to the candidate’s studies, “legal&nbsp;cannabis&nbsp;will grow the Arizona economy by $3 billion, create 50,000 good jobs, bring in hundreds of millions in tax revenues, and reduce judicial and correctional costs.”</p>

<p>Noah said, “Though I have never used cannabis, advocating for legal cannabis is important to me because it’s the right thing to do. I’ve talked to thousands of Arizonans, and one issue about which we’re united is that we’re ready for legal cannabis. People who use cannabis are tired of living in fear, and people who don’t are tired of wasting resources on arresting, prosecuting, and jailing cannabis users. We’re also tired of missing out on the economic opportunities that cannabis provides.”</p>
