<p><span>What do you think about the state of our country today? And what is your opinion about our society? &nbsp;These are things I think about every day. </span></p>

<p><span>I think our country is at risk—slipping out of our representative democracy that is formally called a republic and informally called a democracy. And my opinion about our society is that we blame problems on “those people” too much and don't have enough collaborative problem solving.</span></p>

<p><span>And the result of this societal game of “victim, victim, who’s the biggest victim?” is detrimental to our civic health and community well-being. (If you just had a reaction to that statement, keep reading!)</span></p>

<p><span>My choice in life is to do something constructive and contributory — no matter my personal situation. And sometimes that’s really, really hard. Especially when I’m angry and just want to pile on to the blame game. The blame game is easy. </span></p>

<p><span>Citizenship is harder. Recovering a lost democracy is dang-near impossible. We all pick our battles.</span></p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="My choice in life is to do something constructive and contributory — no matter my personal situation." author="Debilyn Molineaux, Co-Director of Bridge Alliance"]

<p><span>We often do battle within ourselves, too. We value being rational and non-emotional. Yet as human beings, we are actually ruled by our emotions. </span></p>

<p><span>Some of the most rational people I know will passionately defend how non-emotional they are. It’s ironic. But almost every decision we make must be emotionally approved or we won’t do it. </span></p>

<p><span>In other words, does this decision feel right? What do we actually mean by “feels right?” </span></p>

<p><span>People describe this process of emotional buy-in as intuition, or a gut feeling, or heart-centered. It’s our way of checking for emotional safety as we live our lives. </span></p>

<p><span>This is a fallible system. It’s based on what we know and have experienced in the past. </span></p>

<p><span>The old, existing system doesn’t often say “this new, scary thing you’ve decided is OK with me!” Instead, it fights like hell saying, “No — don’t do that! Danger!” </span></p>

<p><span>And this is exactly the point. New and different = danger. Old and comfortable = safe. </span></p>

<p><span>But what if old and comfortable were not safe? This is when we often decide to venture out and try new things. Our country is at this point, right now — old and comfortable = danger. It’s time for us to have an adventure together. All. Of. Us. </span></p>

<p><span>By the way, this emotional buy-in is not a bad thing, it is necessary. It’s also what allows us to be manipulated by marketers, political campaigns and politicians. And it’s time to break free of this manipulation.</span></p>

<p><span>Back to “victim, victim, who’s the victim?” In our society, some people have been disadvantaged while others have been advantaged. This is where “the biggest victim” game comes in. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As we struggle to be seen, to have our grievances heard, we end up competing for attention. People who are privileged, still get to choose whether or not to pay attention and/or assist.</span></p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="We are on a shared adventure to fulfill the mission of our founders — e pluribus unum. " author="Debilyn Molineaux, Co-Director of Bridge Alliance"]

<p><span>My assertion is that the system itself will only perpetuate more of what we already have. Creating a different future, where people are both responsible and empowered, will require us to have tremendous courage. Courage to look for evidence that supports or refutes our emotional safety check. </span></p>

<p><span>No longer is, “I have a good feeling about this” enough to justify our personal or collective decisions. Because what your gut tells you and what my intuition tells me are likely different things. </span></p>

<p><span>And until we listen to each other, talk, connect and deliberate in good faith, we are more likely to be manipulated. A strong connection among citizens in communities, where your gut feeling wants to include what I know intuitively, puts the current system on notice. </span></p>

<p><span>We are on a shared adventure to fulfill the mission of our founders — e pluribus unum. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s a good place to get started. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Participate in the <a href="https://nationalweekofconversation.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Week of Conversation</a>. It kicks off Friday and runs through Saturday 4/28. Steel your courage to reach out and have a conversation you would have avoided. </span></p>

<p><span>Start by remembering a few things we have in common:</span></p>
<ul>
 	<li><span>We are all human beings</span></li>
 	<li><span>We all live on Spaceship Earth</span></li>
 	<li><span>We all want to leave a better planet for our kids</span></li>
 	<li><span>We all enjoy the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As you participate in one or more conversations this week — whether in line at the grocery store, with your neighbors or one of the hundreds of events being hosted in-person or online, be curious about someone else. And think about walking a mile in their shoes.</span></p>
