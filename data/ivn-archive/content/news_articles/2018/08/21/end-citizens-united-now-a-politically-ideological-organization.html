<p>The 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United ruling opened the door for money to flood into political campaigns.</p>

<p><a href="http://endcitizensunited.org/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fight For Reform</a> was established as "<a href="http://fightforreform.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A State Level Project To End Citizens United,"&nbsp;</a>and stem the tide of that money pouring into politics. The group has advocated for the better part of a decade aiming to get money out of politics, and make our government truly representative. One of their cornerstone missions is to "<a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ms_ffr_fr_q22018_ffr?refcode=MS_EM_FR_2018.08.21_B1_Defeat-Trump-Judges_X__F1_S1_C1__all_RS&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=5,35,50,100,250,500,1000" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defeat Corrupt Politicians.</a>"</p>

<p>But a recent blast email from the group, brings questions of their real intentions.</p>

<p>Check out their request below:</p>

<h3><strong>Campaign To Elect Progressive Judges</strong></h3>
<p>The email requests money for a campaign to elect Progressive Judges, an effort to combat President Trump's conservative judiciary push.</p>

<p>It certainly begs the question: Why is End Citizens United now an anti-Trump advocacy organization to elect progressive judges?</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's Judiciary</strong></h3>
<p>It's true, President Trump has spent his first year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/politics/trump-judges.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">rapidly filling</a> Article III judgeships at Supreme, appellate and District Court levels.</p>

<p>In fact a data analysis found Trump is ranked No. 6 of 19 presidents appointing the highest number of federal judges in their first year.</p>

<p>Fight For Reform is now using this data for a fundraising campaign.</p>
<h3><strong>Fight For Reform Video</strong></h3>
<p>"This takes the interest of government away from actual citizens, actual people and puts it almost entirely in the interests of corporations." ~ Concerned taxpayer</p>

<p>The video pushes the idea that if we all work together and unite, we can take back our government. Certainly few would argue against that concept.</p>

<p>But the email request conveys that the organization is content with "progress," so long as it reaffirms their political ideology.</p>

<p>Getting money out of politics isn't a blue or red or green or purple strategy, it's an important message that gets dimished when a groups ideological interests interferes with their "mission."</p>
