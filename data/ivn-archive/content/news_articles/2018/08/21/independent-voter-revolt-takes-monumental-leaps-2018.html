<p>In the latest episode of "In Full Color," I talk with <a href="https://independentvoting.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voting</a> President Jackie Salit, who has spent several years advancing election reform policies and working outside the two major parties to effect change for a better democratic process.</p>



<p>Jackie and Shawn discuss the <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/07/25/15-ways-independent-revolution-taking-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic growth in independent activism</a> following the 2016 elections, where Salit says a voter rebellion began with the popularity of candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>Now, Jackie says the independent movement is in the process of establishing its identity in a year that has seen increased voter registration outside the major parties; record-number of independent candidates running; bigger, stronger coalitions forming to challenge the two-party duopoly; and more!</p>

<p>The podcast was recorded during the first-ever <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/20/250-independent-leaders-unite-during-historic-fight-two-party-control/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unite Summit</a> in Denver, Colorado. The event was hosted by <a href="https://www.uniteamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unite America</a>, a national organization that is providing structural and financial support for independent candidates to run competitive campaigns.</p>

<p>More than 250 independent candidates, activists, organization leaders, reformers, and more gathered to discuss the future of a nationwide political shift that can be best summed up as a rejection of the two-party status quo.</p>
