<p>San Diego, CA.- San Diego Congressman Duncan Hunter and wife Margaret have been indicted on fraud and campaign finance related charges.</p>

<p>The charges stem from Hunter and his wife's misuse of&nbsp; $250,000 worth of campaign funds for personal expenses and the filing of false campaign finance records. The Department of Justice investigation went on for more than a year.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury in California returned the 48-page indictment detailing the allegations against the couple.</p>

<p>Republican Party leaders had long worried that with a potential indictment looming, Hunter's traditionally safe district which makes up much of eastern San Diego County could be at risk of Democratic takeover in November's midterm election.</p>
<h3><strong>Michael Smolens Interview</strong></h3>
<p>The 50th Congressional Race was part of an interview I did with San Diego Union-Tribune Columnist Michael Smolens. The Union-Tribune has been very critical of Hunter and we discussed the race and if he thought his opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, had a chance to win.</p>

<h3><strong>What's Next?</strong></h3>
<p>Hunter's Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a former department of labor aide in the Obama administration, has reportedly outraised him.</p>

<p>If a federal candidate chooses to withdraw from contention, their name will remain on the ballot unless they seek removal of their name from a judge, according to the California Secretary of State's office.</p>

<p>At this late juncture, there is no possibility of a write-in campaign. Only Hunter and Campa-Najjar will appear on the November ballot, since they were the top vote-getters in California's top-two primary in June.</p>
