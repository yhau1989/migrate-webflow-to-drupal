<p>A three-judge panel <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/2018/08/27/fc04e066-aa46-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html?utm_term=.ffcaa5f1fd2d" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled Monday</a> that North Carolina's congressional districts once again violated the US Constitution. This time, however, it was not on racial grounds -- but partisan.</p>

<p>The court further ruled that the maps may need to be redrawn ahead of the November elections, just a little over two months away.</p>

<p>North Carolina legislators are expected to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. The high court is short a justice after Anthony Kennedy's resignation.</p>

<p>Lower courts appear to be increasingly willing to rule on the partisan nature of electoral maps. However, the Supreme Court <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/07/11/the-gerrymander-case-who-speaks-for-the-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer">punted two cases this year</a> for lack of standing, holding that the cases were more about partisan interests than individual legal rights.</p>

<p>"[T]his Court is not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences. The Courtâ€™s constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority in <em>Gill v. Whitford</em>.</p>

<p>In this case, the federal court ruled that the Republican Party unconstitutionally gerrymandered the congressional districts over Democrats -- at its core being the interest of two political parties and their members.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further developments on this story.</p>
