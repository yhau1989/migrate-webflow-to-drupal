<p>San Diego, CA.-&nbsp;A<span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=eb9595d8-c029-4d6c-946c-0ada29b42230&amp;c=37" rel="noopener noreferrer">new poll</a></span>&nbsp;of likely voters in the 50th Congressional district shows&nbsp;<span><a href="https://hunter.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rep. Duncan Hunter</a></span>&nbsp;maintaining his lead in the largely rural, Republican district.</p>

<p>77% of likely Republican voters in California's 50th US Congressional District stand by indicted and disgraced Congressman Duncan Hunter, according to SurveyUSA research conducted for KGTV-TV in San Diego and the Union-Tribune.</p>

<p>Among those likely to vote in the 11/06/18 mid-term Congressional election:</p>

<p>-Hunter leads Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar by 7 points among those who are&nbsp;aware&nbsp;of the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>-Hunter leads by Campa-Najjar by 7 points among those who say they are&nbsp;unaware&nbsp;of the criminal investigation.</p>

<p>Should any other Republican run in Hunter's place, that as-yet unnamed Republican defeats Campa-Najjar by 15 points, 51% to 36%.</p>
<h3><strong>"Yawned Over Indictment"</strong></h3>
<p>The poll, conducted for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.10news.com/news/politics/poll-rep-duncan-hunter-s-indictment-having-little-effect-on-reelection-campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 News</a>&nbsp;and the San Diego Union-Tribune, shows Hunter with 47 percent to Democratic challenger&nbsp;<a href="https://www.campacampaign.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ammar Campa-Najjar</a>‘s 39 percent.</p>

<p>Voters were called Aug. 22-26, the time during which news broke about the indictment of Hunter and his wife Margaret for&nbsp;alleged personal use of campaign funds.</p>

<p>“In some respects, voters in Hunter’s district greet news of the indictment with a yawn,” noted SurveyUSA, which conducted the poll.</p>
<h3><strong>Independents Split</strong></h3>
<p>62% of district Democrats say Hunter should resign his Congressional seat now.</p>

<p>64% of Republicans say Hunter should remain in office and seek re-election.</p>

<p>Independents split: 37% say Hunter should resign; 37% say Hunter should press ahead.</p>

<p>69% of conservatives say charges that Hunter and his wife Margaret mis-appropriated $250,000 in campaign funds and then filed false finance records with the government are <span><a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/22/politically-motivated-congressman-duncan-hunter-jr-responds-to-indictment/" rel="noopener noreferrer">politically motivated.</a></span></p>
