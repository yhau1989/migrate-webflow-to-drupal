<p>San Diego, CA. - San Diego Padres Managing Partner Peter Seidler, who has spent the better part of the last two years and a considerable amount of money backing the SoccerCity initiative, has issued a news release relating to his continued support of SoccerCity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/386660234/Peter-Seidler-Statement-on-SoccerCity#from_embed" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Statement below:</a></p>


[pullout_blockquote quote="While I financially and conceptionally backed Soccer City in 2016 and early 2017 based on my reasoned assumption that SDSU leadership, San Diego political leadership and Soccer City would collaborate on a modern stadium, it both surprised and disappointed me that common ground could not be found" author="Peter Seidler, SoccerCity Investor"]

<p>In the release Seidler writes, "I have been ‘neutral’ on both proposed developments and related ballot measures for the past 16 months. While I financially and conceptionally backed Soccer City in 2016 and early 2017 based on my reasoned assumption that SDSU leadership, San Diego political leadership and Soccer City would collaborate on a modern stadium, it both surprised and disappointed me that common ground could not be found." Seidler continued, "I remain hopeful that a family-friendly facility will be built that benefits all San Diegans; however, my view on the two competing initiatives will remain ‘neutral.'"</p>
<h3><strong>Seidler's SoccerCity Contributions</strong></h3>
<p>The first sentence in Mr. Seidler's statement does raise some legitimate questions: "<em>I have been ‘neutral’ on both proposed developments and related ballot measures for the past 16 months</em>," Seidler writes, but according to <a href="https://public.netfile.com/Pub2/AllFilingsByFiler.aspx?id=165599847" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign finance reports</a> filed with the City Clerks Office, he was supporting the SoccerCity effort not two months ago.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot from that form:</p>

IVN San Diego has reached out to the SoccerCity campaign for reaction to the statement.

While we did hear from a campaign strategist, we have yet to receive reaction. We will post their comment if we receive.

IVN San Diego did speak to representatives with the Friends of SDSU campaign, they declined comment.

<h3><strong>SoccerCity Goes After SDSU and Initiative&nbsp;</strong></h3>
While Seidler is clearly edging away from the table, SoccerCity and their communications team continue to get their fill on hitting SDSU.

Former Mayor Jerry Sanders communications head Darren Pudgil, now a communications consultant with SoccerCity, has taken aim at SDSU and the initiative, drawing on a recent San Diego Union-Tribune article that points to a drop in season ticket sales.
