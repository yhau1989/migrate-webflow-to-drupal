<p><strong><span>OLATHE</span>, Kan.</strong> - Kansas independent gubernatorial candidate Greg Orman announced Monday that he and his running mate, State Sen. John Doll, garnered 10,338 signatures to qualify for the November ballot.</p>

<p>The Orman campaign submitted over twice the amount of signatures required by state law.</p>

<p>“The two parties do everything in their power to put up roadblocks and barriers to prevent anyone but their own from participating in our electoral process,” said Orman. “That won’t work this year, and Sen. Doll and I will give Kansas voters a strong Independent choice this Nov. for the first time in generations."</p>

<p>Orman and Doll submitted these signatures to the Kansas secretary of state a day before the state's primary elections. Though independents do not participate in the primaries, Orman is calling on voters to <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/02/independent-ks-governor-we-are-majority/" rel="noopener noreferrer">declare their independence Tuesday</a> to show the strength of the independent vote.</p>
