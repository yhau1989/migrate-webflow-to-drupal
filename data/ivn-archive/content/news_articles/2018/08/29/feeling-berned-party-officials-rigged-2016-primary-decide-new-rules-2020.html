<p>In the latest episode of In Full Color, I talk with Nick Brana, who was the national outreach coordinator for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in 2016. Nick returns to the podcast to talk about new DNC rules he says offer Sanders supporters "crumbs" while hurting candidates like Sanders, who want to run, but aren't afraid to challenge the party platform on various issues.</p>



<p>Nick and I discuss:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The consequences of the DNC's new rules;</li>
 	<li>The ruse of the new superdelegates "reform";</li>
 	<li>Bernie Sanders in 2020;</li>
 	<li>Sanders' damaged credibility with independents (stay tuned for a follow up article on this); and</li>
 	<li>Why the parties are desperate&nbsp; to cling to politics as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>You won't want to miss the full interview.</p>
