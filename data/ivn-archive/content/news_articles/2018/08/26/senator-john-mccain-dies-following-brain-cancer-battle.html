<h3><strong>A Life Well Lived</strong></h3>
<p>An author, POW, U.S. Congressman and Presidential candidate, McCain was in the public spotlight for most of his life.</p>

<p>Politically, McCain was more nonpartisan and less ideological compared with many other national politicians.&nbsp;<sup></sup>His stature and reputation largely stemmed from his service and capture during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>Senator Dianne Feinstein, who has served alongside Sen. McCain for more than two decades, said this of her political rival:</p>

<h3><strong>"We're Getting Nothing Done"</strong></h3>
<p>McCain was largely lauded for his recent speech on the Senate floor following the failure to replace and repeal Obamacare. It was his vote that secured its demise.</p>

<p>McCain addressed the Senate last July for the final time. Sen. McCain said, "What have we to lose by trying to work together to find solutions for the American people. We're not getting anything done, and I don't think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work."</p>

<p>He continued, "I've had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me confused with someone else.&nbsp; I appreciate it though, every word, even if much of it isn't deserved. I'll be here for a few days, working on a bipartisan bill with the Senate armed services committee. After that, I'm going home for awhile to treat my illness, I have every intention of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about me. And I hope to impress on you again that it is an honor to serve the American people in your company."</p>
