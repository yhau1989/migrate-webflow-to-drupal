<p>The passing of the iconic Aretha Franklin at the age of 76, has many combing through her playlist, playing the songs that bring memories back to life.</p>

<p>From "Day Dreaming" (1972) to "Rock Steady" (1971) and "A Natural Woman" (1967), Franklin's all-time vocal talent brought her fame and fortune and the unforgettable label, "The Queen of Soul."</p>

<p>While she made hundreds of songs, these three translate well into today's divided political climate.</p>
<h1>1) Bridge Over Troubled Water</h1>
<p>The nation has never been more politically divided. The media, president, activist judges, and organizations are all to blame.</p>

<p>"Bridge Over Troubled Water," the remake of the Simon and Garfunkel classic, stands out at a time when our country could use a little bridge of solace.</p>

<h1>2) R-E-S-P-E-C-T</h1>
<p>The iconic anthem of feminism and black pride speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Today those movements are healthier than ever, though repackaged. For feminism, it's been manifested in the <a href="https://metoomvmt.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MeToo</a> movement. For black pride, the origination of <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a>&nbsp;is their manifestation. BLM states: "We are working for a world where Black lives are no longer systematically targeted for demise. We affirm our humanity, our contributions to this society, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression."</p>

<h1>3. Chain of Fools</h1>
<p>Chain, Chain, Chain! While "Chain of Fools" is really a song about the breakdown of a relationship, it transfers well in today's political climate.</p>

<p>The mainstream media has been treating the American people like a chain of fools. Polls say it's not working.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a> says the American people's trust in the media is at an all-time low. President Trump's "Fake News" label has stuck, and has arguably, only exacerbated the problem.</p>
