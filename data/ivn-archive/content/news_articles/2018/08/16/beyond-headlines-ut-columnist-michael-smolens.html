<p><em>IVN Beyond The Headlines</em></p>

<p>We spoke about a number of issues including why San Diego can't seem to solve its most pressing issues including homelessness, the stunning failure of the convention center expansion, what will happen with Mission Valley, the failure to get the San Diego Police Review Board on the November ballot, and what's going to happen in the 50th Congressional District as a big name has entered the fray.</p>
