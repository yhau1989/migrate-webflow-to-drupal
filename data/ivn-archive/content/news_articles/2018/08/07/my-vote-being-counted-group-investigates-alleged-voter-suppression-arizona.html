<p>In my latest interview, I talk with independent campaign manager and digital marketing expert <a href="http://heyjenngray.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenn Gray</a> about a new voter suppression investigation she and her group, Arizona Independents United, are conducting in Maricopa County, Arizona.</p>



<p>Jenn believes there are multiple layers of inept -- possibly corrupt -- election administration practices in the county that have led to vast numbers of valid ballot petition signatures being discarded, voters being removed from the active voter rolls, and even mail-in ballots that are not being counted.</p>

<p>How is that a voter who has voted in every single election is reported to have voted in few elections? And, How is that large numbers of voters sign ballot petition signatures without knowing their voter registration status?</p>

<p>Jenn and Shawn discuss these questions and more in the latest episode of "<em>In Full Color</em>."</p>

<p>More about Jenn Gray:</p>

<p><em>Jenn Gray is the host of the <a href="http://jenngray.com/category/podcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leading Liberty podcast</a> and a sought-after marketing and fundraising expert for libertarian causes and campaigns. Best known for her record-breaking success with Larry Sharpe’s campaign for governor of New York, she also managed Kevin McCormick's campaign for governor that uncovered several serious voter suppression issues in Arizona. </em></p>

<p><em>Jenn works exclusively with pro-liberty non-profits and political campaigns, most recently as a digital marketing strategist for Reason magazine, Young Americans for Liberty, and a successfully elected libertarian on her hometown city council — for which she was a finalist for Campaign &amp; Elections magazine’s coveted Reed Award for Best Use of Video on a Social Platform. During the 2016 election cycle, she self-funded video ad campaigns for Johnson Weld that reached over a million non-libertarians for a fraction of a penny apiece — and has since taught hundreds of activists how to replicate her results. </em></p>

<p><em>Jenn is a mother, a small business owner, an independent voter, the founder of Arizona Independents United, a write-in candidate for Secretary of State, a former development director at the Goldwater Institute and Prometheus Institute, an instructor in the Libertarian Leadership Academy, the creator of several online courses, and a featured guest in several independent media outlets and the "I Am Gary Johnson" documentary film.</em></p>
