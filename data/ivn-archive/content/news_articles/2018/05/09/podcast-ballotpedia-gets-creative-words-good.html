<p>What happens when you marry a passionate group of pro-voter Americans to an encyclopedia? You get Ballotpedia.</p>



<p>No government public information officer or website can do what this non-partisan online political encyclopedia does - it hands Americans free, simple, useful, actionable information. It also takes the who, what, when, whereâ€¦ and then goes to unheard of lengths to offer a balanced "why".</p>

<p>The team even create new words when the one in common use becomes so partisan it blocks thoughtful discussion.</p>
