searchTitle: What Is Conditional Voter Registration?
-->
<p>Are you a California citizen? Did you miss the registration deadline to vote in the June primaries? Well, don't worry, because there is still a way you can cast a ballot in the primary elections.</p>

<p>California offers a new option called <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/" rel="noopener noreferrer">conditional voter registration</a>.</p>

<p>What makes it conditional, you ask? Here is what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>If you missed the May 21 voter registration deadline, you can go into your county's elections office between now and June 5, register to vote, and cast a ballot on the same day.</li>
 	<li>The only way to vote this way is by doing it though your county's elections office or at a designated voter center if you reside in one of the 5 counties that have adopted the Voter's Choice Act (Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, and San Mateo).</li>
 	<li>Voters who did not register before the May 21 deadline cannot vote in their local polling location or vote by mail. It is only through the elections office.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is the basic rundown. You can get the full details on conditional voter registration on the secretary of state's website. You can also check your voter registration status <a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
