<p>The <a href="https://ivn.us/tag/independent-book-club/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politics for the People (P4P) Book Club</a> brings together independent-minded Americans to read a wide range of books—both fiction and non-fiction—of interest to independents.&nbsp; With each selection, we have a lively dialogue on the <a href="https://politics4thepeople.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">P4P blog</a> culminating in an hour conference call conversation with our author.</p>

<p>We just <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/04/05/declaration-independents-candidate-scathing-indictment-two-party-duopoly/" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished reading</a> Greg Orman’s book,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ormanforkansas.com/declaration_of_independents_ebook" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Declaration of Independents: How We Can Break the Two-Party Stranglehold and Restore the American Dream</a></em>. On Sunday, April 15th we spent an hour with Greg talking about his current independent campaign for Governor of Kansas; the lessons he learned in his independent run for US Senate in 2014, and much more.</p>

<p>Our next selection is the historical novel,<a href="https://politics4thepeople.wordpress.com/category/the-secrets-of-mary-bowser/" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;<em>The Secrets of Mary Bowser</em>&nbsp;by Lois&nbsp;Leveen</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a fan of historical fiction. It can free us up to actually gain a deeper understanding of a particular moment in time, the leaders, the lives and the actions of ordinary people that shape history.</p>

<p>This book was recommended by P4P&nbsp;member Caroline Donnola, and I asked her to write the review below.&nbsp; You can visit the blog, read along and join us on&nbsp;<strong>Sunday, June 3rd&nbsp; at 7 pm EST&nbsp;</strong>when we will be talking with author Lois Leveen.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved to read, and then I majored in literature and writing. A lifelong fan of history, I often gravitate toward historical fiction as it combines these two great loves. Every day, on my commute from Brooklyn to Manhattan, I travel with my well-stocked Kindle. When I discovered&nbsp;<em>The Secrets of Mary Bowser</em>&nbsp;by Lois Leveen, I knew I wanted to share it with members of the&nbsp;<a href="https://politics4thepeople.wordpress.com/2018/04/18/next-selection-the-secrets-of-mary-bowser/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politics for the People</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://politics4thepeople.wordpress.com/2018/04/18/next-selection-the-secrets-of-mary-bowser/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book Club.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>The story is an intriguing one. As a young girl, Mary, a Virginia slave, is freed by Bet, the daughter of her master who sends Mary to Philadelphia to be educated. There Mary lives as a free Black woman and becomes active in the Underground Railroad. She builds a new life for herself.</p>

<p>But when Mary’s mother dies and her father becomes ill, she returns to Richmond where she must live, once again, as a slave. When she sees the chance to continue her fight for freedom for all slaves, she becomes a servant in Confederate President Jefferson Davis’ household where she spies on him and reports her findings to Union commanders.</p>

<p>Based on a true story and a real heroine, most of us have never heard of Mary Bowser. And because so little is known about her, the author is forced to imagine how Mary would think, speak and act as a child, in addition to as an educated woman and as a&nbsp;spy who must speak and act like a slave to conceal her identity.</p>

<p>Leveen creates Mary’s world and populates it with real and imagined historical figures in the years before and during the Civil War. We see, hear and feel Mary’s world of loving parents who are determined for Mary to have a better life.</p>

<p>We meet Elizabeth (Bet) Van Lew, the real-life daughter of Mary’s slaveholder who becomes an abolitionist, and upon her father’s death, frees all of her family’s slaves. But Bet cannot free Mary’s father who is owned by another family, and Mary’s mother will not leave without him. We feel Mary’s conflicts as she moves to Philadelphia to live as a free woman but has to leave her parents behind.</p>

<p>During her years in Philadelphia, Mary gets to know ordinary and extraordinary fellow travelers—free Blacks, Quakers and other abolitionists. She learns which parts of town she cannot enter and she encounters hate-filled white mobs.</p>

<p>We learn about the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society and the fights that took place amongst the abolitionists. We hear their arguments about John Brown, and we discover a historic event that took place when the train carrying his dead body passes through Philadelphia on its way to Brown’s burial site. We experience major Civil War battles and turning points. We witness Mary carefully and painstakingly carrying out her work as a Union spy.</p>

<p>I loved how the author was able to get inside Mary’s turbulent thoughts, her fears, her willingness to risk everything. Her relationships with her friends, parents, colleagues, and husband are complex and nuanced. In particular, her relationship with Bet is thorny, but it develops through their joint efforts to end slavery.</p>

<p>Leveen begins the book with two quotes that help shed light on how she thinks about this mix of history and imaginings. From Ralph Waldo Emerson:</p>
<blockquote>“If the whole of history is in one man, it is all to be explained from individual experience… Each new fact in his private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men have done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises.”</blockquote>
<p>And from African American abolitionist and women’s rights leader Maria Stewart:</p>
<blockquote>“Who shall go forward, and take off the reproach that is cast upon the people of color? Shall it be a woman?”</blockquote>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Secrets of Mary Bowser</em>, we go on a journey filled with love, hope, pain, and&nbsp;sorrow. I hope you will relish this journey as I did and join the Politics for the People call with author Lois Leveen on&nbsp;Sunday, June 3rd.</p>
