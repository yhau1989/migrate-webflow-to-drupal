<p>The June Primary is fast approaching!</p>

<p>Candidates are preparing final outreach to voters and are working hard to finish in the top-two of their respective races to compete in the November General election.</p>

<p>California holds a nonpartisan top-two primary, which means that you can vote for the candidate of your choice, regardless of your party registration or lack thereof.</p>

<p>IVN, with the help of the Secretary of State, is providing this ballot voter guide for the top statewide races.</p>

<h3><strong>GOVERNOR RACE</strong></h3>
<p>A new LA Times poll has Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom with a comfortable lead. The race for&nbsp;second place — and a spot in the runoff — is between former Los Angeles mayor and Assembly Speaker&nbsp;<a href="https://antonioforcalifornia.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Villaraigosa</a>&nbsp;and Rancho Santa Fe resident&nbsp;<a href="https://johncoxforgovernor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Cox</a>, a newcomer to California politics. Other leading candidates are State Treasurer&nbsp;John Chiang.</p>

<p>The Governor&nbsp;race has 27 candidates. <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/20/ca-sec-state-voter-guide-governor-candidate-statements/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> for a list of all those in the race.</p>
<h3><strong>LT. GOVERNOR RACE</strong></h3>
<p>Big bucks are being spent on California’s Lieutenant Governor’s race.</p>

<p>The position has little power but does offer name recognition.&nbsp;Even current Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom once wondered if the job had any real purpose. Still, ten people including two former ambassadors, a state senator and a former mayor of Richmond, running as an NPP, are in the running.</p>

<h3><strong>U.S. SENATE RACE</strong></h3>
<p>Sen. Diane Feinstein is defending her status as the Senate’s oldest member when she seeks re-election and her sixth term representing California in the U.S. Senate. The question for Feinstein, as it relates to California is, do voters think she's blue enough?</p>

<p>A field of 32 candidates are competing in the&nbsp;June 5 primary&nbsp;— the candidates with the first and second most votes will move on to a final runoff election for the office.</p>

<h3><strong>ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE</strong></h3>
<p>This is arguably the most important "down ballot" race statewide.</p>

Becerra is one of four candidates vying to reach the November General election.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.baileyforag.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Bailey,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ericearly.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Early,</a>&nbsp;and Insurance Commissioner&nbsp;<a href="https://www.davejones2018.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Jones</a>&nbsp;are in the mix.</p>

State Sen.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ricardolara.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ricardo Lara</a>&nbsp;of Bell Gardens (Los Angeles County) promises to stand up to insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms and fight President Trump’s efforts to cut back on health care. Lara has also pushed for <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/01/ca-insurance-commissioner-candidate-illegal-immigrants-serve-ca-boards/" rel="noopener noreferrer">illegal immigrants</a> to serve on statewide boards.

**Note: Lara announced his candidacy the day after the Secretary of State voter guide was released. So he is not included in the learn more about the candidates link.
