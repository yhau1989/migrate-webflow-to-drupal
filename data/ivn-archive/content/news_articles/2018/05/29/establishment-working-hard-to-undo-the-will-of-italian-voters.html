<p>By vetoing the appointment of 81-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Savona" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paolo Savona</a> over the weekend, establishment Italian President Sergio Mattarella all but nullified the vote of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi" rel="noopener noreferrer">Italian people last March</a>&nbsp;and removed the possibility, at least for now, that the Five Star movement and ultranationalist League "Lega" would form Italy's new coalition government.</p>

<p>The move&nbsp;has had a big impact on world stock markets as it pertains to Italy possibly leaving the Euro. The NYSE is substantially down in trading.</p>

<p>Mattarella was quoted as saying he is acting in the best interest of the Italian people, "The adhesion to the euro is a choice of fundamental importance for the perspectives of our country and our youth. If you want to talk about it, we need to do it openly and with a serious, in-depth analysis.”</p>

<p>Mattarella's move comes on the heels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvio Berlusconi's</a> refusal earlier this month to stand aside and let the populist coalition form a new government.&nbsp;The four-time prime minister is considered one of the main obstacles to the formation of a new Italian government. As a consequence, Italy has a hung parliament and new election is coming.</p>
<h2><strong>Why It Impacts Markets</strong></h2>
<p>Market analysts have warned that an Italian effort to abandon the Euro would rattle not just European investors, but also U.S. markets.</p>

<p>Oxford Economics analysts Jamie Thomson and Nicola Nobile used dramatic language recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/italys-election-the-nightmare-best-case-and-most-likely-scenarios-for-stocks-2018-03-03" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying,&nbsp;</a>“Ditching the euro would bring a halt to not only the ‘euroboom,’ but also the process of U.S. monetary normalization, with the market reaction comparable to the eurozone debt crisis."</p>

<p>Other analysts however suggest fears about an “Italexit” are overblown.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aclsglobal.com/about-aclsglobal/marshall-gittler-biography" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marshall Gittler,</a> a well known global monetary strategist said, “I don’t think Italy will leave the euro. Support for the euro in Italy has never been below 58%, and most recently was 59%, with only 31% opposed.”</p>
<h2><strong>Five Star and The League Fight Back</strong></h2>
<p>Leaders with the Five Star Movement and the League, the parties that convincingly won the election last March, called Mattarella's actions "unacceptable" and, in a rare move, called for his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-impeachment-factbox/factbox-impeachment-of-a-president-how-it-works-in-italy-idUSKCN1IT1FN" rel="noopener noreferrer">impeachment</a>.</p>
<p>In a interview with Sky News at a rally in Rome, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, said "They've replaced a government with a majority with one that won't obtain one."</p>
<p>League Leader Matteo Salvini raged against the establishment. Salvini said,&nbsp;“The upcoming elections will not be political, but instead a real and true referendum ... between who wants Italy to be a free country and who wants it to be servile and enslaved. Today Italy is not free; it is occupied financially by Germans, French and eurocrats.”</p>
<p>The reason they have not yet been able to form a government is because in Italy, the two houses of parliament are equally powerful and the approval of both is needed to form a government. Since no coalition has a majority in either, deals need to be struck if a new election is to be avoided. And those deals aren't being reached, hence a new election.</p>

<h2><strong>Italians Back To The Polls</strong></h2>
<p>Italians will head back to the polls either this summer or early next year.</p>
<p>A new poll found that a majority of Italians disagreed with Mattarella's decision to veto Savona's appointment.</p>
<p>Alberto Nardelli works as the Europe Editor for politics for Buzzfeed. His tweet conveyed the results of that poll as Italians grow more frustrated with the establishment:</p>

<p>It also found support surging for the League or Lega, a party&nbsp;that seeks mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. The Lega and Five Star have nearly 60% of the vote between the two.</p>
<p>It now seems possible that the League could siphon support further from both the center-right and even the Five Star Movement, and emerge as the most influential player in Italian politics.</p>
