<p><span>… But I do know an animal when I see one. </span></p>

<p><span>Yesterday, the White House put a fine point on President Trump’s description of MS-13 gang members as “animals.” In a 491 word posting on the White House website, White House staff used the word </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/need-know-violent-animals-ms-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>“animals” no fewer than 10 times</span></a><span> in describing MS-13 atrocities. </span></p>

<p><span>The knee jerk reaction since 2016 of the Resistance left and the Resistance media is that if Trump said it, they have to be against it.</span></p>

<p><span>With his MS-13 comments, Trump has put his political opponents willingly in the position of defending the dignity of a group whose motto is “Kill, Rape and Control.” A gang that, as White House staff artfully describes in their press release, stands accused of “stabbing a man more than 100 times and then decapitating him, dismembering him, and ripping his heart out of his body.”</span></p>

<p><span>As soon as the press release hit the web, the left half of the partisan media immediately began their usual spin. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/philip-bump/?utm_term=.df2af0446faf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Philip Bump,</span></a><span> writing in the Washington Post, compares Trump calling the MS-13 “animals” to him speaking out about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. While I have seen some really hard hitting in NFL games, I’ve not seen the opposing lineman’s heart ripped from their body. Perhaps before writing about MS-13 again, Bump should take a walk through MS-13 territory in Fairfax County.</span></p>

<p><span>E.J. Dionne, also writing about Trump’s comments in the Post, thinks “...dehumanizing others always leads us down a dangerous path.” </span></p>

<p><span>As if on cue, a Facebook group called Vocal Progressives dehumanized Trump by comparing him with Hitler. It made </span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-animals-hitler/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Snopes.</span></a></p>

<p><span>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in response to Trump’s comments, wondered if Trump does not “believe in the spark of divinity? In the dignity and worth of every person?”</span></p>

<p><span>Regardless of how she feels in her soul about the opportunity for redemption of people who regularly beat little girls to death with baseball bats and machetes, progressives are </span><a href="https://go.justicedemocrats.com/sign/stenyhoyer/?source=em20180427&amp;t=1&amp;akid=2207%2E290198%2EMR30vd" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>in all-out war </span></a><span>with the Democratic establishment. Strategically, Pelosi needs every opportunity to appeal to the far left.</span></p>

<p><span>And the progressives are fulfilling their role in pulling her to the left. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, a rising star among far-left progressives, called Trump’s comments about MS-13 “racist” and referred to MS-13 as a "vulnerable population."
</span></p>

<p><span>Notably, Schaaf is not now nor will she ever be in a race against a Republican, unlike her </span><a href="https://dccc.org/races/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>100 or so Democrat colleagues </span></a><span>currently competing in swing seats. That loud groaning noise you hear is the collective grumbling of every Democrat campaigning against a Republican in a swing district. They are trying to figure out how to explain to suburban mothers why we should all speak more kindly about the most violent gang in the world.</span></p>

<p><span>As groups like the </span><a href="https://www.justicedemocrats.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Justice Democrats</span></a><span> pull the Democratic Party further to the extreme with knee-jerk opposition to everything Trump says, it might be hard for any independent-minded voter to believe that the they actually stand for something of their own.</span></p>

<p><span>The generic congressional ballot gap - would you prefer a Republican or Democrat for Congress - was as wide as 14 points at the beginning of 2018. Meaning that just by virtue of having a D by your name, you had a 14 point advantage. It has since shrunk to </span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2018_generic_congressional_vote-6185.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>4 points</span></a><span> in the most recent poll.</span></p>

<p><span>If you look deeper into the polling, you find that a third of swing voters are most interested in the economy, 23% say North Korea is most important to them and 22% are most concerned about immigration. Using good manners with violent street gangs is not even on the list.</span></p>

<p>Something has driven the Democrat drop in the polls. Much like the Tea Party with the Republicans, perhaps it is the leftward pull of Progressives.</p>

<p><span>With this act of messaging jiu-jitsu, Trump has gotten the Democrats off any message that independent voters care about, and on to one that could drive them away. This is a day that, love him or hate him, you think Trump could be a genius… or at least the best troll the Internet has seen.</span></p>

<p><span>BREAKING: Neither Trump nor Pelosi, Schaaf nor virtually anyone in the mainstream media have yet commented on the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/ms-13-member-known-animal-sentenced-40-years-prison-rico-conspiracy-involving-murder" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Tuesday sentencing of MS-13 member Joel Martinez, AKA “Animal,”</span></a><span> to forty years for murdering a fifteen-year-old boy. </span></p>
