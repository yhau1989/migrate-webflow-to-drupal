<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act does many things including these essential points:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Establishes the right to know what information big businesses are collecting about you, your devices and your children;</li>
 	<li>Gives you the ability to tell companies to stop selling your personal information; and</li>
 	<li>Empowers you to hold companies accountable for data breaches and breaking the law.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mactaggart noted, "This initiative will give consumers a real choice about whether they want their private information bought and sold by companies they’ve never heard of, will help shine a light onto the business of data brokerage, and will empower California consumers to protect their sensitive personal information.”</p>
<h3><strong>Big Tech Rallies Against Privacy Initiative</strong></h3>
<p>Several Big Tech corporations are funding the opposition to the Privacy Act including Google, AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon.</p>

<p>In April, Facebook dropped their opposition funding to the privacy measure after revelations that they had breached the data of 87 million of their own users.</p>
