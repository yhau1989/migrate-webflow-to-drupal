<p>T.J. O’Hara, the host of Deconstructed, is joined by Kyle Bailey, the campaign manager of both Maine’s ranked choice voting and Terry Hayes for Governor.</p>

<p>The two discuss the history (and struggle) of ranked choice voting in Maine, the benefits of RCV, Maine’s history with independent and third party candidates, the difference between RCV and plurality voting, and more.</p>

<p>Kyle Bailey has over a decade of experience in management and fundraising for candidate campaigns, ballot measure campaigns, and advocacy organizations. In 2016, Kyle led the first-in-the nation successful statewide ballot measure campaign to adopt ranked choice voting by the second largest vote of the people in Maine’s history.

Born in Florida and raised in Georgia, Kyle lives in Gorham, Maine with his husband State Rep. Andrew McLean.</p>
