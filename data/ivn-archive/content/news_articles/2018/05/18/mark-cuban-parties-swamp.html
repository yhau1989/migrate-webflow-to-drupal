<p>There has long been speculation that US businessman Mark Cuban might run for president as an independent or third party candidate in 2020.</p>

<p>While there is a giant question mark over a potential presidential run, it's certainly clear that Cuban believes something needs to be done to break up the two-party duopoly:</p>

<p>And Cuban went on for several tweets about the need to unite as Americans and reject tribalistic politics and the two-party status quo:</p>

<p>As I continue to report on my column, <a href="https://ivn.us/columns/in-full-color/" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Full Color</a>, there are serious efforts underway to challenge the duopoly.</p>

<p>Coalitions of <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/01/22/broad-coalition-national-election-reform-groups-unite-challenge-two-party-duopoly/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reformers</a> and <a href="https://ivn.us/tag/bridge-alliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer">civic action groups</a> are forming to create a more accountable and representative political process. There are also organizations now that are providing the structural and financial foundation for independents to launch viable campaigns.</p>

<p>One of those organizations, <a href="https://www.uniteamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unite America</a>, responded to Cuban to point out that what he is calling for is already in the works:</p>

<p>Unite America is running a <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/13/unite-america-director-history-made-november/" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic slate of independent candidates</a> for statewide offices across the country, as well as for state legislative races in states like Colorado and Washington state.</p>

<p>These campaigns are viable, they are competitive, and they are seeing success on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, for instance, is the only sitting independent governor in the US and has broad public support among his constituents.</p>

<p>In Colorado, the 5 members of the independent slate for state legislature <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/16/one-independent-most-influential-politician-colorado/" rel="noopener noreferrer">outraised their Republican and Democratic opponents</a> <strong>COMBINED</strong>.</p>

<p>Breaking the two-party stranglehold on our elections and the legislative process is not impossible.</p>

<p>Cuban is right. It will take the collective action of millions of people who are fed up with a system that puts the interests of private political parties over the will of voters.</p>

<p>But as Bridge Alliance Co-Director David Nevins <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/26/saving-republic-business-leaders-need-step/" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out</a>, business leaders will need to step up as well.</p>

<p>Industry titans like Mark Cuban have the background, name recognition, and resources to help this crucial movement take on the two-party behemoths.</p>

<p>History is being made, and Cuban could play a big role in it. As he says, "It's time for politicians to represent their voters, rather than their parties."</p>
