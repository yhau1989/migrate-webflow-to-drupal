<p><strong><a href="https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voters Not Politicians</a></strong> recently launched a new ad for their proposed ballot measure (Proposition 2) to institute a nonpartisan redistricting commission in Michigan. The measure is currently before the state Supreme Court where mostly Republican-backed groups and the state's attorney general are trying to remove it from the ballot.</p>

<p>The narrator of the ad starts by saying that as voters, we have the "freedom to choose our leaders," and that this right goes beyond party affiliation.</p>
<p><em>"But when politicians in Lansing manipulate the process by picking their own voters, it undermines our democracy. It's called gerrymandering, and President Ronald Reagan called it a 'national disgrace.'"</em></p>
<p>In what is truly a remarkable story of grassroots strength, Voters Not Politicians started as a single Facebook post and turned into a nonpartisan redistricting initiative that gained ballot access with the support of over 400,000 Michigan voters.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for coverage on the Michigan Supreme Court's ruling. A decision is expected Tuesday, just before the court's session ends.</p>
