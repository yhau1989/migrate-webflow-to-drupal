<p><strong>OLATHE, KANSAS</strong> - Greg Orman, independent candidate for Kansas governor, and his running mate, State Sen. John Doll, released the first of eight detailed policy proposals Thursday that are part of the campaign's&nbsp;Problem Solving Platform. The title of the proposal:&nbsp;“Making Government Work For The People Again.”</p>

<p>According to Orman's campaign, the number one priority is to ensure that the Kansas state government works for the people first.</p>

<p>“​What we’ve had in Topeka is a government dedicated to serving itself and shutting out Kansas citizens from the problem-solving process,” said Orman.</p>
<p><em>“We Kansans are at the cusp of reclaiming our state from further damage by political tribalism and nationally driven agendas, and we can and will become a shining example of what a state can do when its public and private sectors, and most importantly, its citizens pull together to build a better future.”</em></p>
<p>The plan outlines four major priorities that include over a dozen promises and targeted reforms. These priorities are to:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Create a government that serves and listens to the people;</li>
 	<li>Create an accountable, transparent government;</li>
 	<li>Reclaim the government from special interests; and</li>
 	<li>Create a culture of involvement, innovation, and common sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Check out the full plan <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/ormanforkansas/pages/195/attachments/original/1531336694/Problem_Solving_Platform__Plan_1_of_8.pdf?1531336694" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>"I will employ a collaborative and open approach to leading Kansas into the future that ensures our government is working for the people, not special interests or national party agendas," says Orman.</p>
<p><em>"We will leave behind the political animosity and partisan gridlock that has been holding us back for far too long. I will focus on the following four priorities to make sure that the government of Kansas is working for the people again."</em></p>
<p>From legal and political battles over the school budget to misappropriation of highway funds to voters being illegally purged from the voter rolls, the Kansas government has had <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/02/25/5-things-that-have-people-asking-what-the-heck-is-going-on-in-kansas/" rel="noopener noreferrer">no shortage of problems</a> over the last few years. And it has attracted national attention.</p>

<p>Orman's campaign says his Problem Solving Platform will address many of the challenges that have emerged as a result of special interest-driven, party-first politics in Kansas, including needed reforms in economic development, health care, education, and more.</p>

<p>On the election reform front, Orman is calling on</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Political parties to reimburse the state for their own primary elections if Kansas is going to continue to use closed primary elections;</li>
 	<li>Additional state funds to help upgrade county election equipment and provide funding to audit and inspect voting machines; and</li>
 	<li>A constitutional amendment to establish a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Greg Orman officially launched his campaign for governor in January. He previously ran a competitive race against incumbent US Sen. Pat Roberts (R) in 2014, but fell short of a win. Now, he faces a tough race against multiple candidates running for the state's top office.</p>
