<p>Another common core complaint? Nope. Failing at our standardized testing? Not even close.</p>

<p>America's worst math problem right now is in how we talk about numbers in our daily lives, especially in political conversations.</p>

<p>It's easy to talk about billions and trillions in political discussions. It's like moving around little counting chips, each one with a trillion dollars stamped on it. All you have to do is be able to count to 100.</p>

<p>But therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>We can talk about a $13 billion super-carrier like the <em>USS Gerald Ford</em>, but it's not-so-easy to talk about the lives impacted by its construction. The people's salaries, the overall impact on the economy, or even funding the interest on such a large-scale project--all are difficult if not impossible to understand.</p>

<p>Right now in America, less than<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/how-much-americans-at-have-in-their-savings-accounts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 25% of the population</a> has access to $10,000 in cash savings--accessible at a moment's notice. Sure, many have larger amounts in their 401-k or home equity, but we're talking about real cash--for real emergencies.</p>

<p>A $25,000 emergency is completely inconceivable to most Americans. Most would have no clue as to what to do if they needed this kind of money overnight.</p>

<p>We can talk and argue about our government's budget like complete experts. We can talk about billions and trillions like it is no amount of money at all--like it was some amount we fully understood.</p>

<p>But we don't.</p>

<p>Joseph Stalin was attributed to saying, 'A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.' Somehow our thinking has become backward to this when it comes to money.</p>

<p>We can convince ourselves that we understand the nature of the $4.09T federal budget, yet when it comes to understanding small needs and emergencies we are clueless.</p>

<p>We can talk down social services programs in our political discussions, but in the event of a true emergency--a whole lot of people truly need them.</p>

<p>And this is where the disconnect exists in America's political mathematics: The spending of trillions is a tragedy, but the individual lives affected by cuts (or increases) is merely a statistic.</p>

<p>If we really want to be good political mathematicians, we have to accept that the economy is complicated. That an increase here or a decrease there affects real people's lives. Because in the end, it's always complicated--just like math.</p>
