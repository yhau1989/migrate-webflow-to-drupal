<p>The lack of an endorsement was noted in Superior Court by SoccerCity attorneys as one of the reasons <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/12/soccercity-to-judge-remove-sdsu-west-from-the-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">they argued</a> SDSU West should be removed from the ballot.</p>

<p>The presentation before the CSU Trustees was made by SDSU President <a href="http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news_story.aspx?sid=77084" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adela de la Torre</a> and Executive Vice Chancellor and CFO <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/about-the-csu/leadership/Executives/Pages/relyea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Relyea</a>.</p>

<p>Fred Pierce, a Friends of SDSU Steering Committee member sent out an email to the&nbsp;<a href="http://sdsualumnipastpres.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Past Presidents Council</a>. Pierce noted, "I am very happy to report that the California State University Board of Trustees officially endorsed the SDSU West Initiative. This is on the heels of the endorsement of our initiative yesterday by the Linda Vista Planning Group. We also released&nbsp;<span>on Monday</span>&nbsp;details of our commanding 62% (in favor of SDSU West) vs. 40% (in favor of SoccerCity) approval rating in a recent poll of likely voters. "</p>
<h3><strong>City Moves Forward With Appeal</strong></h3>
<p>News of the endorsement comes as the City of San Diego announced its intention to appeal its Superior Court ruling to have both <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/07/11/soccercity-prevails-over-city-in-tentative-ruling/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoccerCity</a> and <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/07/03/update-sdsu-west-prevails-over-city-in-final-ruling/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSU West</a> removed from the ballot.</p>

<p>IVN San Diego reached out to Gerry Braun, the City Attorney's Chief of Staff for comment on the appeal, Braun indicated City Attorney Mara Elliott is not available for comment. Although Elliott did issue a release on her Twitter account:</p>
