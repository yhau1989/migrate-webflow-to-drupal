<p>Santa Barbara, CA. -&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/07/25/give-a-straw-go-to-jail-how-plastic-straws-are-becoming-criminal/#5c12291063e7" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Santa Barbara</a>&nbsp;has passed an ordinance that allows restaurant employees to be punished with up to six months of jail time or a $1,000 fine for giving plastic straws to their customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://records.santabarbaraca.gov/OnBaseAgendaOnline/Documents/ViewDocument/Attachment%202%20-%20ORDINANCE.pdf?meetingId=375&amp;documentType=Agenda&amp;itemId=11697&amp;publishId=6263&amp;isSection=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Barbara’s ordinance</a> is certainly the most severe straw ban in the country. Although Seattle banned plastic straws&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/07/01/seattle-becomes-first-major-u-s-city-to-ban-straws/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e0d6e314dd74" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this month</a>, mandating a $250 fine for violators, Santa Barbara has taken it further than Seattle. The city has banned not only plastic straws, but also compostable straws.</p>

<p>And, get this, each individual straw counts as a separate infraction. That means if some poor sod at In-N-Out Burger is the target of an undercover straw sting and hands out straws to a table of four people, that person is facing&nbsp;years&nbsp;behind bars.</p>

<p>Tourists and college students can forget ordering the popular punch bowls at Baja Sharkeez on State Street.</p>
<h3><strong>Knowingly Exposing HIV is a Misdemeanor</strong></h3>
<p>The straw ban is even more outrageous and confounding if viewed through the state's position on transmitting HIV.</p>

<p>Last October, Gov. Jerry Brown<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB239" rel="noopener noreferrer"> signed a bill</a> that lowered the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection from a felony to a misdemeanor .</p>
<div>

Remarkably, the bill also covers those who give blood without telling the blood bank that they are HIV-positive.

</div>
<div>

The bill was authored by state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblyman Todd Gloria of San Diego.

</div>
<div>
<div>When the bill was passed, Weiner said, “Today California took a major step toward treating HIV as a public health issue, instead of treating people living with HIV as criminals. HIV should be treated like all other serious infectious diseases, and that’s what SB 239 does.”</div>
