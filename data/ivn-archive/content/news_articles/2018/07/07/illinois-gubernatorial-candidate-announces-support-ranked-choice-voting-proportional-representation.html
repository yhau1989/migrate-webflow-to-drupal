<p><strong>ILLINOIS</strong> - Libertarian gubernatorial candidate&nbsp;Kash Jackson released a statement Saturday in support of implementing ranked choice voting and proportional representation in Illinois.</p>

<p>"Americans deserve the opportunity to be as in-control of their personal voting as possible. When multiple candidates are ranked on a single ballot it mainstreams the voting process, eliminates the need for run-off elections, and gives voters more say in their representation," Jackson states.</p>
<p><em>"It allows the voice of each voter to be fully heard. Ranked-choice voting will ensure that every voter is represented as fully as possible in our state government. Proportional representation would ensure that every person has a voice and is spoken for with multiple people representing them in government. Both are essential to personal liberties and freedoms."</em></p>
<p>The statement was a response to a press release from Illinoisans for Ranked Choice Voting calling on all candidates running for governor to support ranked choice voting statewide. None of the other gubernatorial candidates have responded yet.</p>



<p>â€œI am encouraged that Mr. Jackson was so prompt and gracious with his response. Our team is excited to work with his campaign to further the discussion of electoral justice in Illinois," says Ben Chapman, president of Illinoisans for Ranked Choice Voting.</p>

<p>Illinois is one of a handful of states with a growing grassroots effort to implement ranked choice voting for statewide elections. Maine was the first state to use ranked choice voting in elections for state offices, US House, and US Senate. The question now is: who's next?</p>
