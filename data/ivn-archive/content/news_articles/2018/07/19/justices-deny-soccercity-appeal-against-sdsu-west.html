<p>San Diego, CA. - The State Court of Appeal has turned down an emergency petition filed by lawyers representing SoccerCity to have SDSU West removed from the November ballot.</p>

<p>The one page denial order issued by<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/2879.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Presiding Justice Judith McConnell&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and Associate Justices Gilbert Nares and Cynthia Aaron was to the point:</p>

<p>"The petition for writ of mandate and/or other appropriate relief has been read and considered by Presiding Justice McConnell and Associate Justices Nares and Aaron. The petition is denied."</p>

<p>The appeal argued, as did the <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/15/soccercitys-effort-to-force-sdsu-west-off-the-ballot-fails-in-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial SoccerCity lawsuit that failed</a>, that by using the SDSU name, the Friends of SDSU were in violation of state election law and education code.</p>

<p>The courtroom battles are now over.</p>

<p>Voters will decide the fate of the two initiatives and what's to come of the Qualcomm site in November.</p>
