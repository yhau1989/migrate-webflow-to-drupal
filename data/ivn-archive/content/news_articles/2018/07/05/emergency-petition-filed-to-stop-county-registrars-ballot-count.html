<p>San Diego, CA. - An emergency petition has been filed in the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/2620.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Court of Appeal for the&nbsp;4th District</a>, to prevent San Diego County Registrar Michael Vu from finishing the ballot count for the Full Voter Participation Act.</p>

<p>Luis Vargas and San Diego County Republican Party Chairman Tony Krvaric are named as petitioners.</p>

<p>If the emergency stay is granted, it's very likely the <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/18/drafting-error-causing-full-voter-participation-act-confusion/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Voter Participation Act</a> will not be on the November ballot.</p>

<p>Krvaric posted the following message on his twitter account:</p>

<p>The emergency petition adds another layer to what's devolved into a nasty partisan fight, with the end goal being control of the County Board of Supervisors.</p>

<h3><strong>The Drafting Error</strong></h3>
<p>The central issue is whether the legislature can change the signature requirement after the signature gathering began.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The central issue is whether the legislature can change the signature requirement after the signature gathering began." author=""]

<p>The drafting error in the original bill penned by Assemblyman Todd Gloria and the&nbsp;<a href="http://legislativecounsel.ca.gov/home" rel="noopener noreferrer">legislative counsel in Sacramento&nbsp;</a>is what's caused this issue. The original measure stated 10% of the qualified electors in the county needed to sign the measure, or 165,984 signatures. What it should have stated was 10% of voters who turned out in the previous election, or about 67,000 valid signatures.</p>

<p>Errors in drafting the bill, meant the governor had to sign a trailer bill that retroactively fixed the error, that is SB 866, and that is what the new suit is aiming to invalidate.</p>

<p>County Registrar Michael Vu sent IVN San Diego a statement regarding the petition, Vu wrote "Yes, papers were served today. Iâ€™m not aware of any decision by the court instructing us to stop verifying the petition."</p>
<h3><strong>The "Single Subject" Violation?</strong></h3>
<p>Gloria and the legislature acted quickly to fix the drafting mistake. It was then, according to the lawsuit, combined with a few other bills that Governor Brown signed, and that's where the petitioners say, the "single subject" rule was violated.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Petitioners bring this action to enforce the State Constitution and protect the initiative process in the San Diego County from last-minute legislative mischief. " author=""]

<p>The lawsuit reads, "Petitioners bring this action to enforce the State Constitution and protect the initiative process in the San Diego County from last-minute legislative mischief. Just days ago, the State Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, a legislative gumbo bill (SB 866) embracing numerous unrelated subjects. From San Bernardino County public pensions to the Decennial Census to a trade certificate program for state correctional inmates, the bill had it all. Tucked away at the end of the bill (a "budget trailer bill") was a Government Code provision retroactively changing the signature requirements "for an initiative measure proposing an amendment to the charter of the County of San Diego."</p>
<h3><strong>Political Battle</strong></h3>
<p>The Full Voter Participation Act aims to change County of San Diego elections by eliminating the 50%+1 rule, something <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/11/09/measures-k-l-san-diego-city-elections-reformed-historic-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measures K and L</a> did for the City of San Diego in 2016.</p>

<p>Democrats see this move as an opportunity to have representatives elected when the most voters are participating which is clearly in November.</p>

<p>Republicans say this move is a rush to fix their error, and make sure the FVPA impacts the 2020 District 3 Supervisor race. The thinking goes that by forcing <a href="http://www.supervisorkristingaspar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">District 3 Supervisor Kristin Gaspar</a>&nbsp;to the November General election, where more Democrats vote than the June primary, she will be vulnerable.</p>

<p>Democrats currently have control of the City Council and are looking to do the same with the County Board of Supervisors.</p>
