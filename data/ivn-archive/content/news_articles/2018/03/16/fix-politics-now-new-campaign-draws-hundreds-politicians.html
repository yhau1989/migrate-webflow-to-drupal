<p>Transparency, integrity, and accountability. Three words that currently cannot be used to describe elections and the political system in the US. However, a new campaign has launched to change this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.issueone.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Issue One</strong></a>, a bipartisan political reform organization in Washington, DC, launched a national campaign Thursday to address these three important pillars to the democratic process and "<strong>Fix Politics Now</strong>."</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="This campaign is a beacon of hope for voters around the country who feel hopeless that anything can be done to fix our political system." author="Former US Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.)"]

<p>Endorsed by nearly 200 Republicans AND Democrats, Issue One kicked off the "Fix Politics Now" campaign with an event in Philadelphia, during which it unveiled its "<a href="https://www.issueone.org/declaration-renew-promise/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Declaration to Renew the Founders' Promise</a>." The leaders backing the campaign include former members of Congress, governors, and Cabinet members.</p>

<p>According to Issue One, the organization and its ReFormers Caucus "will call on candidates for office and citizens to sign the 'Fix Politics Now' declaration,&nbsp;and be champions of solutions to restore accountability, transparency and integrity in Washington."</p>

<p>“In an age of rising authoritarianism, Americans have seen a deterioration of democratic norms and standards,” said Issue One President and CEO Nick Penniman.</p>
<p><em>“Fortunately, it is not too late to right the course. There is hope for renewal, and solutions that Republicans, Democrats and independents can support. Issue One has recruited a veritable army of heavy hitters from both parties who are issuing the challenge to all of Americans to work together to fix our broken political system.” - Nick Penniman&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>These "heavy hitters" include former US Rep and Issue One ReFormers Caucus Co-Chair Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.), who said,&nbsp;“This campaign is a beacon of hope for voters around the country who feel hopeless that anything can be done to fix our political system.”</p>

<p>IVN editors <a href="https://ivn.us/author/jpowers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Powers</a> and <a href="https://ivn.us/author/lindsayfrance/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay France</a> had a chance to interview Wamp at the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/unrig-the-system" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unrig the System Summit</a> in New Orleans back in February:</p>

<p>The "Fix Politics Now" kickoff event was held at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia. Nearly 50 ReFormers Caucus members pledged to rededicate themselves to reforming the political system.</p>

<p>The declaration was then unveiled at a public event at the National Constitution Center, which included Pulitzer Prize-winning historians Joseph Ellis and Jon Meachan, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, and former US Reps. Marjorie Margolies (D-PA) and Sue Myrick (R-NC).</p>

<p>“Voters are angry and ticked off. Americans are demanding moral and effective leadership,” said Issue One ReFormers Caucus Co-chair Ambassador Tim Roemer (D-IN). “With the launch of this campaign we are calling on Republican and Democratic candidates for office to fight for bipartisan solutions to end the dysfunction on Capitol Hill, rather than embrace the broken status quo.”</p>

<p><strong>ReFormers Caucus members also include former US Rep. Tom Riddle (R-PA) and former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/378477-america-has-a-broken-political-system-our-leaders-need-to-fix" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-authored an op-ed</a> in The Hill Thursday.</strong></p>
