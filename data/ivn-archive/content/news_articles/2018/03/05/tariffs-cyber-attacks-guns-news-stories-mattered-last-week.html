<h4>What to focus on:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://apnews.com/44fe716db208478881fa0181cb57ce19" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>President Trump unexpectedly announced tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) last week</strong></a>. This move resonated well with his base who is excited about the impact on blue-collar jobs and wages. However, it’s yet to be seen if retaliation will come from foreign powers that will adversely affect blue collar jobs in industries like agriculture. People are already throwing around the word “trade war”, but it’s yet to be seen if one will result from this. There are two possibilities&nbsp;that would avoid a trade war. On one hand, President Trump may simply be negotiating and chose these tariffs as an anchor. On the other hand, if the tariffs stay in place, it’s yet to be seen if foreign powers will retaliate.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber/german-government-hack-was-part-of-worldwide-campaign-sources-idUSKCN1GE2H5" rel="noopener noreferrer">The German government was hit by a massive cyber attack that many fear is part of a global effort.</a></strong>&nbsp;Some have already blamed the Russians but Kremlin spokesman Peskov said, “We note with regret that any hacking attacks in the world are associated with Russian hackers but that each time they (the allegations) are made without any tangible proof.”</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-trump/trump-pushes-congress-for-broad-bill-on-guns-after-school-shooting-idUSKCN1GC2M0" rel="noopener noreferrer">In response to the Parkland shooting, President Trump pushed hard for a bipartisan bill on guns.</a></strong>&nbsp;The push is mainly for more extensive background checks, but Trump also mentioned raising the age limit to buy guns, a split from some of his party and the National Rifle Association.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://fortune.com/2018/03/01/kroger-gun-sales-walmart-dicks-cabelas/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free-market forces started making waves in the gun debate, as Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart, and Kroger all changed their policies on selling guns.</a></strong>&nbsp;Dick’s said they will no longer sell assault-style rifles. Walmart and Kroger decided they will no longer sell firearms to people under the age of 21.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/more-than-30-white-house-aides-said-to-lose-top-secret-clearance" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chief of Staff John Kelly implemented a new policy at the White House last week that resulted in many staffers, including Jared Kushner, having their interim top secret clearances downgraded to secret.</a></strong>&nbsp;The policy&nbsp;permits interim clearances only at the secret level and does not permit them at higher levels.</li>
