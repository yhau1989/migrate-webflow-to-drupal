<p>The job of the Controller is to Protect, Advocate, and Promote policies that benefit hardworking taxpayers and should be void of partisan politics. For too long, the Controller’s office has remained silent, resulting in wasted taxpayer dollars. As your Controller, I promise to be vocal and put your interests first. I will Protect taxpayers by auditing projects such as the California High-Speed Rail System. Runaway waste, fraud, and abuse must end! I will Advocate policies that promote fiscal responsibility. We should always ask, “Are we spending your money as effectively and efficiently as possible?” Repeal the Gas Tax: Only 20% of gas tax funds are actually spent on road repairs; forty-one states fix roads better and cheaper than California! Don’t raise taxes, maximize each dollar and spend wisely. Stop Reckless Spending! I will Promote new common sense plans and tax policies like Trickle-up-Taxation. My plan will break the stranglehold of centralized government by moving decision-making authority from Sacramento to the local level.
