<p>With No Party Preference voters poised to <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/02/19/candidates-beware-independent-registration-may-overtake-gop-in-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">surpass GOP registration in California</a>, some Republicans are beginning to distance themselves from the toxic partisanship in their party.</p>

<p>A group titled "New Way California" held a news conference in Los Angeles this week.</p>

<p>The goal is for their party to adopt talking points and policies that could appeal to the surging bloc of NPP voters.</p>

<p>Former CA Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ohio Governor John Kasich and CA Assemblyman Chad Mayes headlined the event.</p>
<h3>ASSEMBLYMAN CHAD MAYES</h3>
<p>The leader of the effort is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chadmayes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assemblyman Chad Mayes.</a> Mayes was first elected to the California Assembly in 2014 and represents the 42nd District.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kasich-mayes-schwarzenegger-appealing-to-npp-voters-and-toxic-politics-90283.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="310" src="cloudinary://kasich-mayes-schwarzenegger-appealing-to-npp-voters-and-toxic-politics-90283.jpg" width="464"></a></p>

<p>Mayes has been&nbsp;calling on the California GOP to veer away from a staunch pro-business and anti-government message&nbsp;and focus on talking points that brings his party more in line with the bluest state in the nation.</p>

<p>Mayes' tough stance cost him political leadership in Sacramento as he was forced to step down as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-chad-mayes-told-to-step-down-as-1503115777-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican leader in August</a>.</p>

<p>His leadership was hailed by Arnold Schwarzenegger at the "New Way California" event as being an example of "principle over politics."</p>

<p>In an interview with IVN, Mayes talked about the Top-Two Primary system in California, the importance of reaching out to all California voters (NPP, Democrat, Republican), and the importance of listening to constituents concerns when elected officials are in a position of power.</p>

<h3>OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH</h3>
<p>Ohio Governor John Kasich tied his successes in Ohio to what could be championed in California.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kasich-mayes-schwarzenegger-appealing-to-npp-voters-and-toxic-politics-77531.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="292" src="cloudinary://kasich-mayes-schwarzenegger-appealing-to-npp-voters-and-toxic-politics-77531.jpg" width="437"></a></p>

<p>From Homelessness to job security and race relations, Gov. Kasich drove home the impacts his policies have had on his constituents. "Do what we needed to do to create prosperity because I inherited a state where we had just lost 350,000 jobs and now we have a net gain of just over a half million."</p>

<p>When he was in congress, Kasich was hailed as a representative who got things done.</p>

<p>His relationship with the Blue Dog Democrats produced critical welfare reform and an historic balanced budget.</p>

<p>In an interview with IVN, Kasich says the key to compromise is simple and yet in the partisan divide of Washington, challenging. "You got to get people in the room and appeal to their better angles," Gov. Kasich said, "and bring them together, sit 'em down and I think you can make progress. And if you can't get anybody to make progress then you're going to have to go raise hell yourself."</p>
