<p><strong>Kevin de León |</strong> DEMOCRATIC</p>

<p>The President is hellbent on dividing our people and demeaning our California ideals. The Washington status quo is either unwilling or incapable of digging in and fighting back. Californians deserve a Senator who will fight tirelessly for their futures with passion and independence. Like many of us chasing the American dream, I understand nothing is handed to you. Only in America could an immigrant housekeeper’s son, like me, grow up to lead the California Senate. I’ve shared your life experiences—struggling to pay for housing, worrying about college tuition and covering health care costs. It’s a struggle too few Washington DC leaders understand. With millionaires occupying two-thirds of the Senate, it’s easy to understand how they have gotten so out of touch with everyday Americans. Despite their rhetoric, DC Democrats are dragging their feet on universal healthcare and climate change, fearing oil and drug company lobbyists. The DC playbook of pandering and procrastinating is obsolete. As your Senate leader, I never settled for small thinking. I led histotoric efforts to improve the lives of everyday Californians by taking action on universal healthcare, pay equity, immigrant and civil rights, a $15 minimum wage, debt-free higher education, and making California a world leader in the fight against climate change. We need new leadership in the Senate to get this country headed in the right direction, with an economy that works for all of us, not just the super wealthy. I will bring proven California leadership to the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>A Campaign for Sanity. There is no such thing as “transgender.” It does not exist. What does exist are broken people who pretend to be the opposite sex and even mutilate themselves in the attempt. In our constitutional Republic we are free to be psychotic as long as we do not hurt ourselves or others but we have no right to lie to children and teach them that this mental, emotional, and spiritual pathology/sickness is normal, natural, or healthy in the slightest possible way. To do so is a very sick attack upon children and a form of child molestation. There is a massive Social Engineering campaign to normalize the soul pathology and social sickness of “transgenderism.” So-called “transgender” children are being used as weapons to attack and destroy normal/healthy children. The objective of these attacks is to warp and then break the moral foundations of increasing numbers of children so that both current and, especially, future generations will be manufactured into psychotics and destroyed. This must be stopped. The children of our state and nation must be protected from this monstrous attack. Please join the developing national campaign to save children from the transgender hysteria and to ban the transgender mutilation of children. Go toTheyAreAttackingTheChildren.org to join the fight to save our children from this war/jihad against them. And please join the Constitution Party—the last and only party in California which will fight to defend our children and families. Chairman—Constitution Party YouTube—USA vs Sodom Inc.</p>

<p><strong>Herbert G. Peters |</strong> DEMOCRATIC</p>

<p>Democrat. Christian. Pro-Life. End Inflation. Constitutional Tax. Restore Prosperity: our first 100 years “we the people” became the greatest wealth producers in the world with no minimum wage and after Civil war tax rate of 3.1%, (today over 20%). As government grows: cost of living grows, cost of housing grows and homelessness persists. Reduce government: close all 800 foreign military bases that cost $156 billion per year; end warrant less spying; reduce cost of keeping secrets and restore constitutional compliance, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Douglas Howard Pierce |</strong> DEMOCRATIC</p>

<p>S6CA00790 Excellence in serving our country, California Native, Los Angeles. Twenty years of service to my country, and continent. I took on the perils of solving homicides across the nation, including cold cases—Primary, Secondary, and serial killers. Majority of cases have been missing children, and young college students. This type of destruction known as home grown terror, Crimes Against Humanity. I worked with all levels of law enforcement agencies in the pursuit of justice, and providing a voice for victims that will never speak again. Some of my cases that were solved have been missing from their families for over thirty years. I’m realistic the new criminal justice system that I will both author and implement for California will offset this type of destruction. California is interwoven with all Tribes of Mankind, all codependent on one another to coexist. A strength that will never be beaten down, broken, held back, or made homeless. I will uphold all rights of all people of the Great California that speaks: Native American Tribes, English, Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean, Armenian, Persian, Russian, Japanese, Arabic, Punjabi, Mon-Khmer-Cambodian, Hmong, Hindi, Thai, and missing children and adults voices. Victim voices that will never speak again! I promise to protect California’s 40+ Million, Constitutional Rights, Uphold Sovereignty, and Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America.

<p><strong>John Thompson Parker |</strong> PEACE AND FREEDOM</p>

<p>“End capitalism—don’t enable it.” Trump’s deportations, police terror, giveaways to corporations, white supremacy, misogyny, poverty, are part of capitalism, and inspired by the previous administration’s record deportations and wars. Your vote for socialist Parker counts—it’s not supporting enablers, but instead inspiring a movement for revolutionary change.</p>

<p><strong>Derrick Michael Reid |</strong> LIBERTARIAN</p>

<p>I am a Californian for all Californians, a moderate and a problem solver, seeking to unite multipartisan factions for solving major problems, primarily including immigration, imprisonment, and corruption. Second class people live in the shadows. Prisons are overpopulated. Political and monetary corruption permeates government functions. With 50 million hungry, 100 million unemployed, and 20 trillion in debt, the two major pandering political machines have failed the nation and have concentrated totalitarian power in DC. As an Engineer, Lawyer and Military, Market, and Geopolitical Analyst, system analysis offers a comprehensive solution set to many problems facing California and the country. Many problems flow from insufficient negative feedback controls. I seek to bring together in compromise opposing factions to find common ground solutions and promote domestic tranquility. Other problems particular to California include indebtedness, poverty, homelessness, taxation, infrastructure, and pollution which can be addressed in the federal context for solving like problems nationwide. The problems are enumerable and the rancor is undignified. Economic stagnation is viewed by corporate revenues and labor participation. The prospects of higher interest rates could implode the bond market, and with it, the equity markets and the economy. Integrated solutions are ready when collapse occurs. Congress should have at least one senator who knows how to recover quickly, with a debt jubilee, a monetary reset, and government reforms to restore real money, honest markets, the Constitution, and the Republic for long term prosperity with maximum liberty.</p>

<p><strong>Jason M. Hanania |</strong> NO PARTY PREFERENCE</p>

<p>My name is Jason Hanania. I am an attorney, an engineer, a former U.S. government employee, and the first technodemocratic candidate. I have no political party, and I do not accept campaign donations. If elected, I agree to use an electronic voting service. Using mobile apps, the Evoting Service will serve 100% of the American people regardless of race, religion, wealth, or gender. If a majority of Californians evote “no” on any given issue, I will vote “no” in the Senate. If a majority of Californians evote “yes,” I will vote “yes” in the Senate. The Evoting Service will be part of a User Platform owned and controlled by the American people. Corporations and government agencies will have no control over the User Platform, nor will they have user accounts. Users can propose legislation, evote on legislation, evote on commercial products, verify evotes, and audit all users in real time. If elected, I will bring the highest-ranking proposals before the Senate. To ensure accountability, the User Platform will utilize blockchain security. Through blockchain security, evotes will be transmitted user to user instead of to a centralized database. Decentralization prevents political parties, corporations, covert agencies, foreign governments, and other potential hackers from manipulating elections. The User Platform first will be crowdfunded and then will self-fund through data analytics. It will eventually provide every American with free, encrypted, decentralized communication capabilities, including internet, email, social media, shopping, banking, and other ad-free data services. Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Alison Hartson |</strong> DEMOCRATIC</p>

<p>Our current establishment is shackled by their addiction to power. After decades of catering to corporate donors, we now have a government that lacks the political will to pass even the most popular policies. We’re all tired of pleading with politicians to represent us. Wouldn’t it be great if you had a Senator who was a true progressive in her heart and didn’t need convincing? Why not elect someone who already believes in Medicare-for-All, $15 minimum wage, and publicly funded college? I have spent my life fighting for our working-class communities. After teaching public high school for ten years, I dedicated myself to fighting for better government. I organized thousands of volunteers in California and together we led the passage of AJR-1 through the state legislature to fight political corruption. I went on to serve as National Director of a non-profit, working alongside legislators and citizens throughout the country to pass measures just like AJR-1. I promise to bring our fight to Congress. Our country has everything it needs to create a prosperous future for all, but first we have to stop the billionaire class from plundering our wealth. Unlike my main challengers, I’m not taking a dime of corporate money, and no dark money, so that you know exactly who I will represent when I get to Washington D.C. You can visit alisonhartson.com to read more about my platform. Send me to fight for you and together we will take back our government.</p>

<p><strong>Dianne Feinstein |</strong> DEMOCRATIC</p>

<p>As California’s Senator, I work hard every day to be a strong and effective voice for our state’s progressive values. I am a proud and consistent advocate for universal healthcare, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and the rights of immigrants. I have taken on the NRA to get assault weapons off our streets, fought for equal pay for women, sponsored legislation to protect Dreamers and other immigrants and championed economic opportunity that lifts up all Californians, especially working families who still struggle in today’s economy. I strongly oppose Donald Trump and his agenda. Trump’s actions divide our nation and diminish our standing around the world. I fought against the efforts of Trump and Republicans to repeal and sabotage the Affordable Care Act. As ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have worked aggressively to hold Trump accountable for his assault on the rule of law. I am fighting to protect women in the workplace and am proud to have passed a law this year that protects young women gymnasts and other amateur athletes from sexual predators. I will continue to resist Donald Trump’s reckless antienvironment agenda. His rejection of climate change science, attacks on California’s protected lands and threats to grant new oil drilling permits off California’s coast must be confronted, and I will fight Trump and his administration to stop them. I humbly ask for your vote so that I can continue to stand up for California in these difficult and challenging times.</p>

<p>The FCC forced roll out of the new 5G wireless technology and Internet of Things will force a cell tower transmitter in front of every 2–12 homes emitting high density, high frequency wireless microwave Radio Frequency radiation (24Ghz–90Ghz). Wireless radiation has been proven to be harmful and will increase cancer, neurological disease, immune system disorders, and damage fertility near these 5G transmitters (google: 5G Scientist Appeal). Studies have shown for decades that RF Radiation has subthermal biological effects below our current FCC guidelines (google: Naval Medical Research Institute 1972). 1996 Telecommunications Act section 704 has been used to ban you and local governments from even considering your health and safety when placing any cell tower near your home. Why would they ban looking at health effects if there were no health effects? We are allowing the industry controlled FCC to microwave poison our children, families, homes and workplaces (google: microwave sickness webster’s). We must stop the deployment of these deadly 5G cell tower transmitters near our homes (google: press democrat Verizon antennas). Enough is Enough! The wireless companies, CTIA their lobby group, industry captured FCC, Senator Thune must be held responsible for the suffering, disease, and death they have caused from wireless radiation exposure (Google: FCC Captured Agency Harvard). There is a new two party system: Representatives who represent corporate interests and those that represent the public’s interest. I represent the public’s interest and swear to protect the health and well-being of all Californians. Vote Kevin Mottus for Senate</p>
