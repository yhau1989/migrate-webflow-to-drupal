<p><strong>ANCHORAGE, ALASKA</strong> - Do you think there is too much foreign influence in government? Is more accountability needed? Well, Alaskan voters are doing something about it.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan group, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/alaskansforintegrity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alaskans for Integrity</a></strong>, is sponsoring an initiative for the 2018 ballot that would limit lawmakers' pay when they fail to pass a budget on time, restrict lobbyist gifts to politicians, increase protections against foreign influence on elections, and strengthen conflict of interest rules.</p>
<p>The group announced Tuesday that the initiative, called&nbsp;The Alaska Government Accountability Act, has been certified for the 2018 ballot after it submitted&nbsp;45,408 petition signatures in support of its provisions.</p>
<p>“Independents, Democrats and Republicans support this initiative to make government more accountable and transparent,” said State Representative Jason Grenn, independent co-chair for Alaskans for Integrity. “This initiative will bring some common-sense reforms to a broken system.”</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the initiative's provisions:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p><em>"No budget, no pay. Legislators would no longer be entitled to the daily per diem allowance if the budget is not passed by the end of the regular legislative session."</em></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p><em>"Restricts lobbyist gifts to legislators. Closes gift rule loopholes to ban lavish meals and alcoholic beverages for legislators paid for by lobbyists."</em></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p><em>"Strengthens conflict of interest rules. Requires legislators to declare conflicts of interest before voting and excuse themselves from voting when they or a member of their family has a financial conflict of interest."</em></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p><em>"Protects Alaska's elections from foreign influence. Corporations with significant foreign ownership would be prohibited from spending on Alaska’s state and local candidate elections."</em></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p><em>"Foreign travel restrictions. Legislators will no longer be able to bill the state for international travel unless they can show how the trip benefits Alaskans and serves a legislative purpose."</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify the "No Budget, No Pay" provision: Lawmakers are currently entitled to a&nbsp;$295/day allowance on top of their 50,400 base annual salary. This allowance is offered every day the legislature is in session and includes extended and special sessions, even if a budget is not passed on time.</p>

<p>According to Alaskans for Integrity, lawmakers received an average of $37,000 "in tax-free per diem" in 2017.</p>

<p>“The no budget, no pay provision is what resonates for so many of us,” said Bonnie Jack, Republican co-chair of Alaskans for Integrity.</p>

<p>The Alaska Government Accountability Act will appear on the primary or general election ballot, depending on when the legislature adjourns this year. Thank you Tzipora Lederman at <a href="https://represent.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Represent.us</a> for the heads up on this story.</p>
