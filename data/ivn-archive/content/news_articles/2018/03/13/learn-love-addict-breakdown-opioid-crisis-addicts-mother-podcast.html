<p>This week, T.J. is joined by Debra Hanby, the mother of an opioid addict who found her life’s purpose through her son’s experience.</p>

<p>T.J. is the host of 'Deconstructed,' formerly titled 'A Civil Assessment.' You can follow IVN's podcast channel on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/independent-voter-podcast/id1143325557?mt=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">iTunes</a> or <a href="http://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a>!</p>



<p>The two discuss the story of Debra’s son, David Hanby. David became a heroin addict after being prescribed Vicodin for chronic pain after back surgery. Debra breaks down the spectrum, how heroin addiction is a chronic brain disease with misplaced stigma, how the opioid crisis came into being, and how recovery programs and insurance plans are currently unable to help addicts fully and completely recover.</p>

<p>If you wish to get in touch with Debra and join her in her cause, please send an email to our producer: kaia@IVN.us.</p>

<p>Debra Hanby is a sales/marketing professional, a wife and a mother of 3 young men. She has worked nation-wide and has been successful professionally, but is most proud of her family. A graduate of Western Illinois University and originally from Chicago she moved to Dayton, OH 30 years ago. Her family resides in a suburb of Dayton, which is the heart of the heroin epidemic. She has been an advocate for the Recovery Community as the opioid epidemic has touched her life personally.</p>
