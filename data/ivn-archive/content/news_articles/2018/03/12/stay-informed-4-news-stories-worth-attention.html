<p>Read about what really matters from the news last week. We provide you the least-biased news about current events so you can go about your day informed, not brainwashed.</p>
<h3>What to focus on:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Last week,<b>&nbsp;President Trump stunned the world by announcing he would meet with Kim Jong-Un.&nbsp;</b><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/11/trump-kim-summit-happen-and-other-key-questions/414711002/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>However, a lot of questions remain.&nbsp;</strong></a>This marks the first time a sitting U.S. president will meet with the leader of North Korea.</li>
 	<li>President Trump walked back his aluminum and steel tariffs, announcing Canada and Mexico will be exempt as long as NAFTA gets renegotiated. He also left the door open for others to be exempt as well. After this change,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/business/trump-tariffs-exemptions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>many governments rushed to get their country exempted from tariffs</strong></a>, fighting the “national security” clause utilized to emplace the tariffs.&nbsp;<a href="https://freewheelus.com/receive-reality-tariffs-trade-wars/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Some believe&nbsp;these tariffs are simply a negotiation tactic and what we’re seeing is “deal-making”, others fear a trade war.</strong></a></li>
 	<li>In response to the recent school shooting,<strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gov-rick-scott-signs-compromise-gun-control-bill-parkland-florida-shooting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a gun-control bill</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The bill&nbsp;raises the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, extends a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns, and bans bump stocks. One of the more controversial pieces of the bill enables some teachers and other school employees to carry handguns.&nbsp;<a href="https://freewheelus.com/guns-are-part-of-the-problem-but-controlling-them-is-a-weak-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The bill is a start, but will it do enough?</strong></a></li>
 	<li>President Trump ended the&nbsp;<a href="https://freewheelus.com/deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>DACA program</strong></a>&nbsp;but gave Congress six months to find a fix.&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dreamers-deferred-congress-lets-daca-deadline-pass/story?id=53464924" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Unfortunately, that deadline has passed and the Republican-led Congress failed to find a solution.</strong></a>&nbsp;Currently, the DACA program remains in limbo as Federal courts have issued injunctions. The Supreme Court has not yet taken up the case until the lower courts make their&nbsp;decision on the legality of repealing the program.</li>
