<p>Katie Fahey, President and Treasure of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voters Not Politicians</a>,&nbsp;is leading an effort to establish a citizen's redistricting commission in Michigan. She and her team have built a statewide network of donors and volunteers who gathered over 400,000 signatures to put the issue before the voters this November.</p>



<p>I spoke with Katie about her journey--from Facebook poster to movement leader--and the genesis of the Voters Not Politicians campaign. What I learned was how committed Katie is to listening and how central she thinks listening is to rebuilding connection and trust between the American people and our government.</p>

<p>Enjoy the interview. I certainly enjoyed talking with Katie. She's an important leader with a real sense of how people from diverse backgrounds and ideologies are reacting to being told by the political establishment how to be, how to act, how to vote, how to think. She has her finger on a certain pulse and an appetite for shaking things up. Right on!</p>

<p>If you have guest ideas, show ideas, topic ideas, please shoot me a note at jopdycke@openprimaries.org. Iâ€™d like to hear from the IVN community about this new podcast as I get going.</p>
