<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/14/17119662/paul-ryan-conor-lamb-pennsylvania-spin" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans</a>&nbsp;now claim he ran as one of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/pennsylvania-congressional-race-conor-lamb-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrats</a> say he's their best and brightest.</p>

<p>The truth, <strong>Conor Lamb</strong> showed America that rejecting partisan politics is a winning formula.</p>

<p>During his campaign,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2018/01/08/nancy-pelosi-paul-ryan-conor-lamb-rick-saccone-18th-district-special-election/stories/201801080095" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lamb blasted leaders</a> of both parties:</p>
<p><em> “I think it’s clear that this Congress is not working for people. I think we need new leadership on both sides.”</em></p>
<p>Lamb said of Nancy Pelosi, "the result of our congressional leadership has been to have people in the district dissatisfied with their performance.”</p>

<p>And of Paul Ryan, "The real issue here is Paul Ryan. He’s the one who has declared that he’s coming after Medicaid and Social Security.”</p>
<h2>Mainstream Media Spin</h2>
<p>The mainstream media is spinning the result as a "wake up call for Republicans," but the result should be viewed as a wake up call for partisans driving their respective party's destructive narratives.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="I think it’s clear that this Congress is not working for people. I think we need new leadership on both sides." author="Rep. Elect Conor Lamb"]

<p>Lamb's independent views on leadership, Congress, and the value of representatives working together to make constituents' lives better, is the important takeaway.</p>

<p>The media is instead focused on the ratings-driven "winners and losers" paradigm.</p>
<h3>The Return of the Blue Dog Democrat</h3>
<p>Conor Lamb's victory could signal the return of the group more concerned with getting things done in Washington than mugging for cameras and toeing party lines: The Blue Dog Democrats</p>

<p><img alt="" height="193" src="cloudinary://conor-lamb-won-rejecting-partisan-politics-16667.jpg" width="257"></p>

<p>Blue Dogs were moderates who subscribed to the old adage that all politics are local. The group had a conservative voting record and a simple mindset: Search for a compromise between left and right positions.</p>

<p>Formed in 1994, the original Blue Dogs were cofounded by former Rep. Gary Condit. Condit valued his Republican counterparts views as much or even more than his left-leaning friends.</p>

<p>Condit spoke with me about Conor Lamb and his nonpartisan approach.</p>

<p>"The Democratic Caucus needs to embrace him and his conservative agenda," says Condit. "They need a bigger tent and this is a great opportunity. They needn't dictate his politics and what he needs to do, but embrace him and work with him."</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="It's time for both parties to not be embedded in partisanship, but in creating real solutions for the American people." author="Former US Rep. Gary Condit"]

<p>Condit believes the time could be ripe for a return of the group similar to the Blue Dogs.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing. We need a resurgence of moderates in both parties," says Condit. "For the Democratic Party, re-establishing the middle ground is critical. He'll need help to get it done... but you gotta start somewhere. It's time for both parties to not be embedded in partisanship, but in creating real solutions for the American people."</p>
