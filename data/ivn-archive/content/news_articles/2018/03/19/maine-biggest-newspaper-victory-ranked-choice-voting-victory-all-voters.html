<p>There is no question that what is happening in Maine with ranked choice voting is historic.</p>

<p>For the first time in US history, a statewide ballot will use ranked choice voting for governor, state legislature, US House, and US Senate.</p>

<p>For the second time in Maine history, <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/05/ranked-choice-voting-appear-maine-ballots/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voters successfully pushed a people's veto</a> against the actions of the state legislature after politicians delayed the voter-approved ranked choice voting law and set it up for repeal.</p>
<p>[button color="Primary" size="large" url="http://ivn.us/tag/rcv-maine" text="Read More"]</p>
<p>The significance of this has not gone unnoticed, not even by Maine's largest news outlets.</p>

<p>The Portland Press Herald, Maine's most popular newspaper, for example&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/02/04/our-view-future-of-initiative-process-rides-on-ranked-choice-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back in February</a> that if the extraordinary efforts by the <a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Committee for Ranked Choice Voting</a>, and their volunteers <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/01/11/volunteers-brave-bone-chilling-cold-to-defend-voters-rights-in-maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in unforgiving winter cold</a> were successful (and they were), they would accomplish three important things:</p>
<p><em><strong>• "</strong>Voters would be able to reaffirm their support for the law that they passed and which the Legislature shot down."</em></p>
<p><em><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;"They would also get a chance to give the system a test drive, since the people’s veto puts the Legislature’s work on hold. At the same time they say “yes” or “no” on ranked-choice voting, they will also decide primaries with more than two candidates, like the 11-way Democratic gubernatorial contest, with ballots that let them rank their choices."</em></p>
<p><em><strong>• "</strong>And voters will be able to send a message about what they think of the much-maligned referendum process itself. Mainers unhappy with the way that Augusta has altered or outright dismissed a series of laws passed through citizen initiatives in recent years will have a chance to assert that they are also “lawmakers,” and under our constitution, have no less authority than elected officials to pass legislation."</em></p>
<p>The Press Herald even understands the greater implications that extend beyond ranked choice voting:</p>
<p><em>"Voters have approved bond issues, school funding targets, minimum-wage standards and expansion of health care benefits, only to see Gov. LePage and a number of lawmakers treat these measures as suggestions, not laws.&nbsp;These questions are often blunt instruments that need to be refined in Augusta before they go into effect. But, as with ranked-choice voting, the elected officials act is if they were dealing with a bill submitted by a single representative, and not a law that was approved by a majority of voters."</em></p>
<p>The paper's editorial board adds, "A defeat for ranked-choice voting in June would be an endorsement of the dismissive attitude elected officials have shown for the people who elected them. A victory would send a signal to whomever is in the State House next year that the people are ultimately in charge."</p>

<p>June's primary election will already make history, but Maine voters will have yet another opportunity to make history again while sending a clear message to the people they elect to represent them.</p>

<p><em>Correction: The article originally stated this was the first time the people's veto had been used. A 2011 repeal of election day registration was <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2011/11/08/politics/early-results-indicate-election-day-voter-registration-restored/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reversed by people's veto</a> in November of the same year. The article has been updated.</em></p>
