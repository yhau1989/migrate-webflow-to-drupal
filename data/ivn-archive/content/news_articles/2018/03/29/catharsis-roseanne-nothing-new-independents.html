<p>People over Parties.</p>

<p>It's the DNA of independents.</p>

<p>The freedom and liberty to choose the candidate or initiative we think is best for the country has always been the hallmark of who we are.</p>

<p>Independents have been working for years to elevate our national political conversation that better educates and serves our country, not two political corporations.</p>

<p>FoxNews, MSNBC and CNN are working hard to keep the point/counterpoint, two-party conversation alive, it's likely the success of <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/roseanne" rel="noopener noreferrer">'Roseanne'</a> will not be highlighted in an industry that thrives on negativity.</p>
<h3><strong>Coins in the Cushions</strong></h3>
<p>This brilliantly timed new 'Roseanne' captures not the diviseness of the GOP and Democratic parties, but rather, the inspiring and consistent independent spirit of the country.</p>

<p>In its destructive two-party narrative, the mainstream media has couched the show as supporting a blue or red paradigm, but with every passing day we're finding fewer and fewer coins in those cushions.</p>

<p>'Roseanne' is about the value of listening to each other, ingesting another point of view, and turning that interaction into an inherently more civilized society.</p>
<h3><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></h3>
<p>"The idea that people can agree to disagree is kind of missing from everything." ~Roseanne Barr</p>

<p>Clearly Hollywood needed evidence that an enormous course correction was needed. Sagging ticket sales and the lowest show ratings of all-time didn't seem to be impacting executives decisions.</p>

<p>Enter 'Roseanne.'</p>

<p>Her independent comedy just gave Hollywood&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roseanne-is-a-huge-hit-in-return-to-abc-2018-03-28" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 million</a>&nbsp;examples for what Americans want.</p>

<p>Can you imagine, the ability to laugh again at political humor!</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="I really hope it opens up a civil conversation between people instead of just mudslinging, I really do, cause I think we need to be more civilized than that." author="Roseanne Barr"]

<p>To actually have a conversation about what's happening in this country without screaming at each other.</p>

<p>Are you listening Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Myers?</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/roseanne-barr-call-trump-exciting-sweet-shows-ratings/story?id=54090651" rel="noopener noreferrer">George Stephanopoulus on ABC's Good Morning America</a>, Roseanne talked about fixing this broken democracy, "What we need to do as a country is figure out what we don't like, talk to each other, and figure out how we're going to get it changed or fixed."&nbsp; She continued, "I really hope it opens up a civil conversation between people instead of just mudslinging, I really do, cause I think we need to be more civilized than that."</p>
