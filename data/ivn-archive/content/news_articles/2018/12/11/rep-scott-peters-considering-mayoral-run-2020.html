<p><strong>San Diego, Calif.-</strong>&nbsp;In a story on <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/420810-scott-peters-mulls-bid-for-san-diego-mayor" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill,</a> Rep. Scott Peters is considering running for San Diego mayor in 2020.</p>

<p>In an email exchange with Peters' office last week, a spokesperson wrote to IVN San Diego re: a mayoral run, "We are not currently working on a statement nor do we have any announcements yet, but I’ll be in touch when he makes a decision."</p>

<p>That sentiment was somewhat clarified on Tuesday as&nbsp;MaryAnne Pintar, Peter’s chief of staff, said the four-term Democratic Congressman is looking into a possible candidacy. “We are looking at it. Given that the primary is in March 2020, a lot of people will be looking to make an announcement early next year, which means we will need to make an announcement in the next couple of months.”</p>
<h3><strong>Formidable Candidate</strong></h3>
<p>Peters recently endorsed fellow California Democrat&nbsp;<span>Nancy Pelosi</span>&nbsp;to be the next Speaker of the House and is one of four vice chairmen of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.</p>

<p>His thoughts were recently highlighted on IVN's <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/08/ivn-beyond-the-headlines-rep-scott-peters-talks-midterms-pelosi-and-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond The Headlines.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Peters served on the San Diego City Council from 2000 to 2008 and then as a commissioner for the Port of San Diego before being elected to Congress in 2012.&nbsp;Other Democrats who might be considering a run for the city's top post include: City Councilwoman Barbara Bry and state Assemblyman Todd Gloria.</p>

<p>According to the former campaign manager for current Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Jason Cabel Roe, "No Republican has hinted they might be willing to enter the race."</p>
