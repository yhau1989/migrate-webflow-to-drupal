<p><strong>SAN DIEGO, CALIF.</strong> - It didn't take long for people to move past the 2018 midterms, even with accusations of election fraud stalling congressional results in North Carolina and a recount <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/12/03/maine-congressional-recount-to-go-until-new-congress-sworn-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">set to begin in Maine</a>. Potential Democratic contenders to President Trump are already signaling their intentions to run in 2020, including former VP Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Biden is currently on a tour promoting his new book, and during one of his stops in&nbsp;Missoula, Montana, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/04/politics/joe-biden-most-qualified-person-president-2020/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>:&nbsp;"I'll be as straight with you as I can. I think I'm the most qualified person in the country to be president."</p>
<p><em>"The issues that we face as a country today are the issues that have been in my wheelhouse, that I've worked on my whole life."</em></p>
<p>The number one issue that faces Democrats heading into 2020 is reaching middle class voters, particularly in the rust belt where many disenchanted Democrats and independent voters cast a ballot for Donald Trump in 2016 -- tilting the election to his favor. Democrats will need a nominee who can win these voters back.</p>

<p>Biden believes his experience gives him an edge:</p>
<p><em>"I've been doing this my whole adult life, and the issues that are the most consequential relating to the plight of the middle class and our foreign policy are things that I have -- even my critics would acknowledge, I may not be right but I know a great deal about it."</em></p>
<p>The former VP says he will make a decision within the next couple of months about a 2020 bid, and he isn't the only one. US Senator Kamala Harris said she will <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/419354-kamala-harris-will-make-decision-on-2020-run-over-holidays" rel="noopener noreferrer">take the holiday to decide</a>. US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says she is <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/12/03/rep-tulsi-gabbard-seriously-thinking-can-best-serve-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer">seriously considering how best she can serve the country</a>.</p>

<p>A former chief strategist for Clinton says <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/12/democratic-pollsters-hillary-clinton-will-run-again-in-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">she will run again</a>, and politicos are watching what politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders will do.</p>

<p>The shortlist of prospective Democratic candidates in 2020 is becoming clearer and we haven't even gotten to 2019. Clearly, people shouldn't expect much of a reprieve from the 2018 midterms to the next presidential election.</p>
