<p><strong>AUGUSTA, MAINE</strong> - Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap's office announced Monday that the recount in Maine's 2nd Congressional District will begin on Thursday, December 6, and will take approximately 4 weeks.</p>

<p>US Rep. Bruce Poliquin is <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/27/defeated-gop-congressman-calls-hand-recount-in-historic-ranked-choice-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">contesting his election defeat</a> to Democratic challenger, Democrat Jared Golden. Golden won in the second round of ranked choice tabulation, with over 50% of the vote.</p>

<p>Here's the thing: The recount will pause on Christmas week from December 24 to January 2, and will begin again on January 3 if it is not completed sooner. Members of Congress are sworn in on January 3.</p>

<p>In other words, voters in Maine's 2nd Congressional District won't know who will end up representing them until after the new session begins.</p>

<p>This has caused a great deal of confusion over what happens if the recount extends past January 3? Will the seat be empty? Will the district be unrepresented until the recount is settled?</p>

<p>As I understand it, Golden, who is considered the representative-elect, is still scheduled to be sworn in on January 3. He has already been through orientation and introductory activities, including the selection of his office.</p>

<p>A federal judge will hear a lawsuit brought by Poliquin Wednesday, who is challenging the constitutionality of ranked choice voting. Poliquin also <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/28/rep-bruce-poliquin-now-requesting-new-election-defeat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed an amended motion</a>&nbsp;in court last week requesting a new election if the the election certification was not halted.</p>

<p>Based on the judge's <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/15/federal-judge-denies-gop-congressman-attempt-stop-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous rejection of a temporary restraining order</a> request to stop the ranked choice tabulation, it seems unlikely the judge will order a whole new election.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that ranked choice voting has been challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court, and the voting method has been upheld a number of times.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further developments on this story.</p>
