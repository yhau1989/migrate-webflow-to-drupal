<p>But Gabbard added she didn’t have any timetable for deciding on a White House run.</p>
<p>Earlier in the weekend, Gabbard traveled with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/03/looks-like-bernie-sanders-is-running-for-president-again-despite-warning.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent Sen.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders</a>&nbsp;of Vermont, who appears to be on the verge of making his own 2020 presidential announcement, and whom Gabbard endorsed for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.</p>
<p>Gabbard lamented President Trump's rhetoric,&nbsp;“it is painful and disheartening to me to see the direction of our country today. To see how much divisiveness and hatred is being fomented by those who wish to tear us apart.”</p>

<h3><strong>The "Power of Political Love"</strong></h3>
<p>She then noted there is no force more powerful than love. “When we start from this foundation of love, inspired by this love, then we can truly have that strength and that power to be able to take on the tough challenges that are before us."</p>
<p>The 37-year-old Gabbard is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party. An independent spirit, she's a Major in Hawaii Army National Guard who also served two tours of duty in the Middle East.</p>
