<p><strong>San Diego, Calif.</strong>- As we wait for the final ballot count to determine the <a href="https://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/state-assembly/district/77" rel="noopener noreferrer">77th Assembly district</a> race, there are still about 20,000 votes remaining, Republican incumbent Brian Maienschein, who leads Democrat candidate Sunday Gover by 757 votes, was the recipient of some rare kudos from a Democrat.</p>

<h3><strong>Gonzalez Goes To Bat For Maienschein</strong></h3>
<p>Even though California Democrats enjoy a supermajority in the state, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez spoke highly of Maienschein and the working relationship the two have.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/bonus-podcast-san-diegos-power-couple/?utm_source=Voice+of+San+Diego+Master+List&amp;utm_campaign=3e304137ac-Politics-Report-RSS&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_c2357fd0a3-3e304137ac-84180189" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent podcast</a> on Voice of San Diego, Gonzalez noted, "I think Sunday is a fine woman and a fine individual who would make a great legislator, but the reality is this, I have a good friendship with Brian Maienschein. And when I needed somebody who will listen to my argument and, and possibly cross the line and make a really tough vote, I knew I could go to Brian,” Gonzalez said.</p>

<p>When Gonzalez was asked if it would be uncomfortable if Gover wins the seat, she responded “Well, look, I don’t think so, but I’ve seen a lot of Democrats who come in to take Republican seats. We’ve seen this happen a lot in my tenure and they, they’re very, they’re afraid of those tough votes. A lot of times we’re struggling to get to 41 on tough economic issues because Democrats who feel like they’re in a vulnerable position can’t go up on it.”</p>
<h3><strong>Maienschein the Independent</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://ad77.asmrc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assemblyman Maienschein</a>&nbsp;is rated as one of the most independent, moderate Republicans serving the state.</p>

<p>Consider this.</p>

<p>The Republican Maienschein has 100% approval marks from Planned Parenthood, 100% from PawPAC – California’s Committee For Animals, “No Legislator has done more for the protection of animals than Brian Maienschein,” and 100% from Equality California.</p>

<p>As<a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/29/ca-democrats-target-moderate-republicans-in-bid-for-supermajority/" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;CALmatters’ Dan Walters</a>&nbsp;told IVN San Diego, “Brian has been a terrific moderate, has been willing and demonstrated his ability to go across the aisle and get things done for his constituents."</p>
<h3><strong>Mods Will Be Important Factor</strong></h3>
<p>The State Assembly's next legislative session begins Jan. 7. And while it's expected to be a progressive agenda, there is discussion about the importance of reaching across the aisle to more moderate Democrats and Republicans to ensure a legislative balance.</p>

<p>Sacramento has a number of caucuses which have different agendas that will need to be respected and included, this was&nbsp;highlighted in a <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/14/caucus-collision-ca-assembly-factions-taking-shape-for-new-session/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent IVN article</a>.</p>

<p>One Republican political consultant Mike Madrid noted, "Just because it’s a one-party state doesn’t mean it gets easier. In many ways it will be more difficult. Personal agendas and personalities will play a bigger role."</p>

<p>Reaching across the aisle, as Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez noted, will arguably be more important than ever to prevent party gridlock in Sacramento.</p>
