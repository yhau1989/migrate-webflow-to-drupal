<p>According to a city spokesman, tax receipts for the 2018 calendar year total $4,745,332.81.&nbsp; The spokesman noted, "The tax revenue goes directly into the General fund&nbsp;to be used for Mayoral and City Council priority services such as public safety, neighborhoods services and street and road repairs."</p>

<p>In addition to tax receipts, permit fees for the city totaled $1.7 million. "Permit fees received by Development Services of $1.7 million are solely revenues of the Development Services Enterprise Fund and not the General Fund. These fees are collected to recover costs incurred by Development Services to process permit applications for marijuana outlets and production facilities in accordance with San Diego Municipal Code Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 15," said a city spokesman.</p>

<p>The first year total is $6,445,332.81.</p>

<h3><b>Farm Bill To Legalize Hemp&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p>Every five years or so, the Farm Bill reauthorizes farm and nutrition programs across the country, but this year the Farm Bill could bring sweeping changes to the Hemp industry.

<p>The legalization of Hemp will impact the CBD industry as a whole to where it's expected to grow by 40% over the course of the next 20 years.</p>

<p>City of San Diego officials were asked about the Farm Bill and here was their response:</p>
<p><em>"Once the proposed 2018 Farm Bill passes, the City will conduct a thorough assessment of the various aspects of the bill to ensure compliance."</em></p>

<h3><strong>Industry Reaction</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://marchandash.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">March and Ash</a>&nbsp;is one of about a dozen <a href="https://potguide.com/california/marijuana-dispensaries/san-diego/" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 dispensaries</a> operating in the City of San Diego. The upscale boutique in Mission Valley is just east of Texas Street.</p>

<p>Blake Marchand is the CEO. He said&nbsp; the city's rules and regulations weren't overly challenging:</p>

<p>"The city has been great to work with and, in turn, we've worked hard to ensure they're happy with our space. We believe that everyone deserves a comfortable and confident cannabis experience and we prioritize customer education, safety, and satisfaction."</p>

<p>As it relates to the Farm Bill, Congress is poised to vote on its passage in the coming week.</p>

<p>March and Ash issued the following statement:</p>

<p><em>"The 2018 Farm Bill takes significant strides in the right direction when it comes to legalizing and regulating the industrial hemp industry. While this is good news for consumers and cultivators alike, greater policy coordination among government agencies like the FDA must be made in order for states like California to make a determination as to how best adhere to federal food and drug standards."</em></p>

<p>As for the City of San Diego, it expects revenues and fees to top $18 million by 2024.</p>
