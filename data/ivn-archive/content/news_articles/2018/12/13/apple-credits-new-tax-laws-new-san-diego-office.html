<p><strong>San Diego, Calif.-&nbsp;</strong>Apple has announced plans to build new office space in San Diego in the next three years.</p>

<p>The company is making the move&nbsp;after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-tax-bill-repatriate-cash.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">new tax laws</a>&nbsp;were enacted late last year. That move prevented Apple from avoiding taxes on international profits.</p>

<p>The company announced last January that it would&nbsp;invest $30 billion in US facilities&nbsp;and create 20,000 American<strong>&nbsp;</strong>jobs by 2023.</p>

<p>In addition to the San Diego office, Apple announced it will build new office space in Austin, Texas as well as Seattle and Culver City.</p>

<p>One of the interesting storylines with Apple coming to San Diego, is the close proximity the tech Giant now finds itself with one of its <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/11/03/broadcom-in-talks-to-acquire-qualcomm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtroom enemies, Qualcomm</a>. The two have had a much publicized feud for years.</p>
<h3><strong>Push For Data</strong></h3>
<p>Apple will also invest $10 billion in US data centers over the next five years, with plans to spend $4.5 billion this year and next and has plans to create 20,000 jobs in the United States over the next five years.</p>

The moves will not impact its Cupertino campus, the sprawling home facility .

The Austin, Texas campus will be huge. It will be less than a mile from the existing one and will be spread across 133 acres. It's expected to make Apple the city’s largest employer, with a workforce of 5,000 employees and the capacity to add 10,000 more.

There’s more to come. Apple also plans to build new offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City over the next three years. Each will be home to more than 1,000 employees.
