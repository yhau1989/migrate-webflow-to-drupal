<p>Ohio Gov. John Kasich is leaning strongly toward running for president in 2020 as a third-party candidate -- the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/05/03/why_john_kasich_should_run_as_an_independent_in_2020_136965.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">wisest course</a>&nbsp;for him. But if he does, he should make systemic political reform part of his agenda.</p>

<p>That’s because, out of sight of most of the media, there’s a growing movement around the country actively working to “unrig” a system that now works for the Republican and Democratic Parties, their donors and affiliated special interests,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">rather than the American people</a>.</p>

<p>The movement has already achieved notable successes and at a 51-organization “summit” sponsored last weekend by the&nbsp;<a href="https://nonpartisanreformers.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers</a>, it was clear the effort will expand in 2020 and beyond.</p>

<p>Nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Elections_and_campaigns_on_the_ballot" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 million</a>&nbsp;people voted this year, and mostly by overwhelming margins, for a bevy of election and ethics reform measures across the country.</p>

<p>Anti-gerrymandering measures passed in Ohio with 75 percent support, in Michigan (61.7), Colorado (71.3), and Utah (50.3). Voters in Maine overthrew their legislature’s attempt to kill a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/how_does_ranked_choice_voting_work" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked-choice voting system</a>&nbsp;while more than 64 percent of Florida voters supported a measure to allow most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/election-results-2018-florida-amendment-restores-felon-voting-rights/1911848002/" rel="noopener noreferrer">felons to vote</a>&nbsp;again after serving their time.</p>

<p>By 60 percent or more, Maryland, Nevada and Michigan adopted&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic voter registration</a>&nbsp;systems. By margins of 75 percent, Missouri and New Mexico adopted “anti-corruption” measures, as did&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndintegrity.org/measure_1_scores_major_victory_against_powerful_special_interests_bringing_more_transparency_and_accountability_to_government_in_north_dakotahttps:/www.ndintegrity.org/measure_1_scores_major_victory_against_powerful_special_interests_bringing_more_transparency_and_accountability_to_government_in_north_dakota" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Dakota</a>, by &nbsp;54 percent, where formidable opposition was mounted by the oil industry.</p>

<p>More than a million people signed petitions to get these measures on the ballot and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/10/25/reform_movement_picks_up_steam_ahead_of_midterms_138455.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tens of thousands</a>&nbsp;of activists campaigned for them.</p>

<p>Kasich backed the Ohio anti-gerrymandering measure, suggesting it wouldn’t be much of a stretch for him to make pro-reform efforts part of his platform. Good-government activists have formed at least 300 local and national organizations and the governor already shares a slogan under which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uniteamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">some</a>&nbsp;of them operate, “<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnKasich?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Over Party</a>.”</p>

<p>Moreover, in his seemingly daily TV appearances and speeches, Kasich invariably emphasizes the need for national unity.</p>

<p>Kasich’s constant criticism of President Trump is partly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johnkasich.com/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy-based</a>&nbsp;-- on Russia, immigration, the national debt, trade, gun control, and deteriorating relations with traditional allies -- but he also has frequently attacked Trump for failing to&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/417075-john-kasich-in-new-hampshire-trump-not-a-unifier-plays-blame-game" rel="noopener noreferrer">unify the country</a>&nbsp;and for practicing “the politics of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnKasich/status/1058027213667344385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1058027213667344385&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonexaminer.com%2Fnews%2Fjeff-flake-urges-gop-to-denounce-trump-promoted-ad-tying-democrats-to-illegal-immigrant-criminal" rel="noopener noreferrer">fear, hatred and division</a>.”</p>

<p>Kasich declared on ABC two weeks ago that he is&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcripts-11-25-18-sen-amy-klobuchar/story?id=59393720" rel="noopener noreferrer">“very seriously”</a>&nbsp;considering a presidential run in 2020. One of his political associates told me he is “definitely running.”</p>

<p>He hasn’t ruled out a challenge to Trump in GOP primaries, but within his circle that’s regarded as a “kamikaze mission,” given that&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/417683-poll-trump-would-easily-defeat-potential-gop-rivals-in" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a>&nbsp;show Trump as the overwhelming Republican Party favorite. If Trump for some reason were not to run, the GOP almost certainly would turn to a dependable party loyalist, not an apostate like Kasich, who refused to attend the 2016 GOP convention in his home state.</p>

<p>The bulk of the Kasich team’s planning efforts, I’m told, are directed at an independent run -- a third-party effort that would make it less expensive to secure a place on the ballot in all 50 state ballots.</p>

<p>To the idea that this is a historically impossible task, one aide said, “Nothing in history has ever happened until it does.” Kasich himself put it this way in an ABC appearance: “Let’s just say that Donald Trump is nominated and Elizabeth Warren is nominated [by Democrats] and you have this ocean of people who sit in the middle.”</p>

<p>Is there a legitimate opportunity for a third party, bipartisan kind of ticket to be able to score a victory or to have a profound impact on the future of American politics?”</p>

<p>Of the 40 ideas for reform outlined at the Non-Partisan Reformers conference last weekend in Half Moon Bay, Calif., one had particular relevance for Kasich.</p>

<p>Dan Howle, executive director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independentvoterproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a>&nbsp;and a key player in California’s adopting an all-candidate open primary for state offices in 2010, pointed out that the Golden State has moved its 2019 presidential primary from June to March 3.</p>

<p>Howle believes he can secure passage of a bill that would give independent (or “no party preference”) voters -- who make up&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/registering-by-party-where-the-democrats-and-republicans-are-ahead/" rel="noopener noreferrer">25 percent</a>&nbsp;of the California electorate -- their own ballot listing every presidential candidate.</p>

<p>If Kasich performs well in the state, it would substantially boost his already-high national name recognition. Howle thinks there’s a chance New Hampshire might adopt a similar system, giving Kasich even earlier credibility and a shot at being included in the televised presidential debates.</p>

<p>To win over those hungry for change -- and a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/244094/majority-say-third-party-needed.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll</a>&nbsp;showed that 57 percent of voters favor creation of a third major party -- Kasich ought to advocate, besides common-sense policies, some key aspects of the reform agenda.</p>

<p>Among the 40 discrete ideas presented at the conference, those at the top of the reformists’ agenda appeared to be wider adoption of moderate-friendly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked-choice voting</a>&nbsp;(probably in Massachusetts and three other states on 2020 ballots).</p>

<p>In that system, used in Australia, Ireland and several U.S. cities -- or ones like it such as&nbsp;<a href="https://electology.org/approval-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval voting</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAR_voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">STAR voting</a>&nbsp;-- voters choose among several names on a ballot; if no one earns a clear majority, second-choice (and, if needed, third-choice) votes are added until a majority winner emerges.</p>

<p>Other priorities included more widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://www.voteathome.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voting by mail</a>&nbsp;to increase voter turnout,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_primaries_in_the_United_States" rel="noopener noreferrer">open primaries</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Automatic_voter_registration" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic voter registration</a>&nbsp;whenever a citizen interacts with government and lawsuits against&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_elections_in_the_United_States" rel="noopener noreferrer">states with closed primaries</a>&nbsp;(limited to party members) organized and paid for by governments.</p>

<p>It must be noted that independents did not fare well in the 2018 elections. Only seven of 25 state legislative candidates endorsed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uniteamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unite America</a>&nbsp;won, and none of its five statewide candidates prevailed even though, nationally, independents attracted some 8 million votes.</p>

<p>A key reason for falling short, according to UA’s executive director, Nick Troiano, was that voters feared independents were merely “spoilers” who would allow a reviled D or R to win. Another reason, he said, is that many independent voters really are Republicans or Democrats reluctant to admit it. Also, many voters are unsure what “independent” signifies.</p>

<p>Those factors could hurt Kasich, too, unless he develops a powerful message, funding network, and support base. He might still lose in 2020, but he could become the leader of a movement as powerful as the Progressives in the late 19th&nbsp;century and have a profound impact on the future of American politics.</p>
