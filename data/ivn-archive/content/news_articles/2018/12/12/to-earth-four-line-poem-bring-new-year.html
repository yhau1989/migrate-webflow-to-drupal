<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>The poet Hart Crane (1899-1932), a favorite of mine, famous for intricate works like “The Bridge” and “For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen” wrote a four-line poem that was never published in his short lifetime, titled “To Earth.” I reprint it here.</p>

<p>In its four simple lines (forming three sentences) it speaks (to me) about beauty and loss, about caring and responsibility, and most of all about tenderness.&nbsp;Someday, the world will have more of that.</p>

<p>My best wishes for a Happy New Year. For all people. Everywhere.</p>
<h3><strong>To Earth</strong></h3>
<p>Be earnest, Earth,--and kind.</p>
<p>This flower that opened in the storm</p>
<p>Has fallen with the after-hush.</p>
<p>Be earnest, Earth,--and kind.</p>

<p>- Hart Crane</p>
