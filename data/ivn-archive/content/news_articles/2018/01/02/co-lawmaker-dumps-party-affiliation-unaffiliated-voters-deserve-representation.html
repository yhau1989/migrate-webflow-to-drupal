<p>“I didn’t change, the system changed. This system is terribly broken.”</p>

<p>That’s what Colorado State Senator Cheri Jahn wrote in her announcement&nbsp;<span><span>on Friday</span></span>, declaring that she’s left the Democratic Party and will serve the remainder of her term as an independent.</p>

<p>“The unaffiliated voters in my district and statewide deserve representation.”</p>

<p><strong>This is a really big deal.</strong></p>

<p>Senator Jahn is now the first independent to serve in the Colorado State Senate and the only independent state legislator currently in office in the state.</p>

<p>After serving 16 years in the state legislature, Senator Jahn said she’s seen state politics only “become more partisan and polarized.” Now, she’s blazing a new trail that many more independent leaders will follow in 2018 and beyond.</p>

<p>This is a big step forward for our movement, and more will follow.</p>
