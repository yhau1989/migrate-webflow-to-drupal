<p>Millions of people are expected to tune in Tuesday night to watch President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress. But according to a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/most_likely_to_follow_trump_s_state_of_the_union_and_democratic_response" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Rasmussen poll</a>, there is also an increased interest in the opposing party's response.</p>

<p>Rasmussen found that 72 percent of likely US voters will follow Trump's State of the Union address by watching the speech and/or news coverage of the address. The polling agency also found that a majority of voters (54%) are interested in the Democratic response as well.</p>

<p>Here is a break down of the findings:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>72 percent of likely US voters "are likely to watch or follow news reports about Trump’s State of the Union speech." Forty-six percent said they are "very likely" to do so.</li>
 	<li>Interest in the State of the Union is up three points from Obama's final State of the Union, but Obama peaked at 79 percent during his eight years in office.</li>
 	<li>54% "are likely to watch or follow news reports about Congressman Joseph Kennedy’s Democratic response to Trump’s State of the Union speech."</li>
 	<li>Interest in the opposing party's official response is up 6 points from Nikki Haley's response in 2016 (48%), which was consistent for GOP responses during the Obama years.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note that there are going to be at least 5 responses to Trump's SOTU, which include Kennedy's response, the Spanish response, and US Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/ivn" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow IVN on Twitter</a> for live tweets of the 2018 State of the Union.</p>
