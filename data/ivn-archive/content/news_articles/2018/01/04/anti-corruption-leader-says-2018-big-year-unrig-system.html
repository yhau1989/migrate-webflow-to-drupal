<p>T.J. O'Hara is joined by <a href="https://ivn.us/author/joshsilver/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Silver</a>.</p>

<p>Silver has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal and featured in outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, Newsweek, NPR, and CBS Sunday Morning.</p>

<p>The two discuss the growing anti-corruption movement and why it matters, the South Dakota Legislature repealing the South Dakota Anti-Corruption Act that voters passed last year, the Unrig the System summit which is coming up in February, and will be a huge opportunity for the movement.</p>
