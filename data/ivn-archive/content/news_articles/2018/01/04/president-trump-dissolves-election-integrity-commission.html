<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-presidential-advisory-commission-election-integrit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced Wednesday</a> that President Donald Trump signed an executive order that dissolves his Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. President Trump issued the following statement:</p>

<p>"Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry.&nbsp; Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.”</p>
