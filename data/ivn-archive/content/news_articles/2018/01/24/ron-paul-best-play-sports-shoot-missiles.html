<p>In a new edition of the Ron Paul Liberty Report, Dr. Ron Paul -- former Republican US representative and presidential candidate from Texas -- discusses an agreement between North and South Korea to march together under one flag for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games.</p>

<p>Paul also discusses the fact that Vice President Mike Pence will be at the games -- mainly expressing concern for what this could mean for ongoing peace talks given Pence's "neo-conservative credentials."</p>

<p>"I would say there are a lot of positive things coming from this. That is why I don't think we need people who depend on threats and intimidation to bring about peace," Paul says.</p>
