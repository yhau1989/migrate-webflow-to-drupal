<p>It's rural v. urban. farmland v. concrete jungle. and, yes, red v. blue.</p>

<p>The latest headline grabbing effort to divvy up the Golden State comes from the founders of the <a href="https://newcaliforniastate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">state of New California</a>. With the reading of their own version of the Declaration of Independence, the group announced they want to remain in the United States, just leave California.</p>

<p>Here is a section from the group's Declaration, "The history of the present Governor and Government of California is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of a Tyranny over the Counties of New California and the State of California. Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to seek a constitutional remedy to the abuse of powers." The entire declaration can be <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/720c6a07-3594-44b7-8098-94fc11bae240/downloads/1c3sut5r6_88440.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">read here.</a></p>

<p>Founder Robert Paul Preston said,&nbsp;"Well, it's been ungovernable for a long time. High taxes, education, you name it, and we're rated around 48th or 50th from a business climate and standpoint in California."</p>

<p>Preston says the state of New California would incorporate most of the state's rural counties, leaving the urban coastal counties to the current state of California. "There's something wrong when you have a rural county such as this one, and you go down to Orange County which is mostly urban, and it has the same set of problems, and it happens because of how the state is being governed and taxed," Preston said.</p>

<p><strong>ARIZONA LAWMAKERS SAYS "LET ME HELP"</strong></p>

<p>Arizona State Rep. Mark Finchem says he would be more than happy to sever California's ties from the union. Although that isn't quite the intent of the New California movement, Finchem introduced legislation, <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/GetDocumentPdf/455399" rel="noopener noreferrer">HCR2021</a>, supporting&nbsp;California’s secession from the United States.</p>

<p>Finchem along with Rep. David Stringer noted,&nbsp;“Arizonans, in deep respect of the United States of America and our constitutional republic that secures the blessings of liberty to us and our posterity, give complete support to California’s secession."</p>

<p>The resolution reads, “California’s obstruction of the constitutional laws of this republic and its efforts to obstruct federal law are a continued threat to the citizens for its efforts to promote sanctuary policies for the sake of illegal naturalization of foreigners, refusing to recognize the rule of law and the constitutional and legal rights of citizens."</p>
