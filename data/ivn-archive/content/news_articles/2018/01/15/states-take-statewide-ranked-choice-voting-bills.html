<p>With the new year, begins a new legislative session. Legislators have the opportunity to use this time to introduce bills to empower voters in their state. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ranked-choice-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranked choice voting</a> (RCV) continues to expand as new bills have been introduced in the Missouri, Virginia, Indiana and Utah legislatures.</p>

<p>On Jan. 3 Missouri State Representative Dan Stacey introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://legiscan.com/MO/text/HB1346/2018" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 1346: Requires all state and federal offices to use ranked choice voting</a>, adding one new section relating to ranked choice voting. The provisions in the bill would become effective on Jan. 1, 2019.</p>

<p>On Jan. 8 Delegate Nick Freitas introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2018/hb553/fulltext/" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 553: Elections for certain offices; ranked choice voting</a>&nbsp;in Virginia. The bill requires members of the United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, the general assembly, governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general to be elected by ranked choice voting.</p>

<p>Another state where RCV was recently introduced was in Indiana on Jan 9. State Senator Mark Stoops proposed&nbsp;<a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2018/bills/senate/400#document-9c99d185" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 400: Ranked Voting</a>, which permits municipalities to implement ranked choice voting for all of the municipality’s elected offices and establishes the procedure for voters to rank candidates in order of preference.</p>

<p>In Utah,&nbsp;<a href="https://legiscan.com/UT/text/HB0035/id/1663449" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 35: Municipal instant runoff voting pilot project</a>&nbsp;is a bill that creates a pilot project to permit a municipality to conduct nonpartisan races using instant runoff voting also known as RCV. The bill also includes standards and requirements for evaluating voter’s ballot choices.</p>

<p>We anticipate even more bills being brought forth this year to advance ranked choice voting in states across the country.</p>
