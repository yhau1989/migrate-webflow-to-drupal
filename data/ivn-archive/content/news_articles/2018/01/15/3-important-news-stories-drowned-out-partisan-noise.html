<p>Read about what really matters from the news last week. We provide you the least-biased news about current events so you can go about your day informed, not brainwashed.</p>
<h4>What to&nbsp;avoid:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>The media contracted “Oprah 2020” fever, so, to stay healthy, avoid it! Sure, Oprah&nbsp;<em>could&nbsp;</em>run in 2020, but at this time we must decide how much we want to spend pondering that possibility.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://freewheelus.com/oprah-2020-care/" rel="noopener noreferrer">To help you out, here’s Free Wheel’s takeaways from “Oprah 2020.”</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What to&nbsp;focus on:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>It’s day five for the many heroes, both volunteer and professional, searching for survivors of the California mudslides.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/13/577842311/california-mudslides-death-toll-rises-to-18-residents-told-to-evacuate" rel="noopener noreferrer">As of last night, the death toll was up to 20, and there’s at least 4 people known to be missing.</a></strong>&nbsp;Our thoughts and prayers are with California.</li>
 	<li>Five days ago President Trump stated he’d sign legislation concerning DACA as long as compromises for border security&nbsp;and immigration were met. However,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump/trump-says-program-protecting-young-immigrants-probably-dead-idUSKBN1F30MA" rel="noopener noreferrer">it seems the discussions broke down</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump/trump-says-program-protecting-young-immigrants-probably-dead-idUSKBN1F30MA" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;yesterday&nbsp;</a></strong>because President Trump tweeted, “DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.” Luckily, the word probably is in that tweet. We need a nonpartisan solution for the many Dreamers out there. Congress can blame President Trump all they want, but the ball is in their court and they need to find a way to score.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/14/north-carolina-gerrymandering-ruling-supreme-court" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Federal Court in North Carolina recently ruled that a 2016 redistricting plan led by Republicans was a violation of both the constitution’s equal protection clause and an infringement of voters’ free speech.</a>&nbsp;</strong>The court ordered the legislature to redraw the maps and, if unable to do so, it would appoint an expert to take up the task. This ruling is a huge break from the norm. If the ruling becomes precedent this would be damaging to both parties who utilize this tactic and beneficial to all voters affected by it.</li>
