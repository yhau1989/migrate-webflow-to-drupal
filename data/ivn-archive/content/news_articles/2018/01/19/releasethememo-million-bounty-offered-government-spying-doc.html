<p>The list of Republican lawmakers and American citizens demanding the release of a classified report that they say reveals political bias at the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) is growing.</p>

<p>The memo is said to contain <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/18/gop-lawmakers-demand-alarming-memo-on-fisa-abuses-be-made-public.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">"alarming" information</a> about the state of government surveillance on American citizens, and Republican lawmakers claim it focuses on the now infamous Trump dossier they say was used by the Obama administration to obtain a FISA warrant to spy and surveil the opposition party.</p>

<p>After reading the memo, several congressmen took to Twitter demanding the release of the document to the public.</p>

<p>But it is not just Republican lawmakers. NSA whistle-blower and known leaker Edward Snowden is also calling on the release of the memo and for Trump to veto FISA Section 702 reauthorization, and send the bill back to Congress.</p>

<p>The other side of this debate, however, claims this is fake news, and says the #releasethememo trend is being driven primarily by Russian bots:</p>
