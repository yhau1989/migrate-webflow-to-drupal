<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/22/government-shutdown-2018-senate-vote-354966" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted Monday to re-open the federal government</a> after two days of a government shutdown. The deal reached between Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats extends government funding to February 8 while lawmakers further debate DACA and immigration reform.</p>

<p>The final vote for the stopgap measure was 81-18 -- with opposition coming from progressive Democrats, two Republicans, and independent Bernie Sanders. Because of the current hyper-partisan environment in Washington, voters are looking at the threat of another government shutdown in two weeks.</p>
