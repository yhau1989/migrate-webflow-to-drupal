searchTitle: County Supervisor Gaspar Gearing Up For Issaâ€™s Congressional Seat?
-->
<p>IVN San Diego has learned from well placed sources that newly elected County Supervisor Kristin Gaspar took a call from House Speaker Paul Ryan, and is being urged to run for the seat vacated by Congressman Darrell Issa.</p>

<p>Gaspar, who is a Republican, was elected to the County Board of Supervisors last November.</p>

<p>She was previously the Mayor of Encinitas from 2014-2016.</p>

<p>In San Diego County, District 3 is included in the 49th Congressional District, so many of the same voters who put Gaspar in office, would be asked to elect her for the Congressional seat.</p>

<p>IVN reached out to Political Strategist <a href="https://www.roestrategic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Cabel Roe</a> for comment. Roe handled Gaspar's campaign for Supervisor. He has yet to respond to our request.</p>
