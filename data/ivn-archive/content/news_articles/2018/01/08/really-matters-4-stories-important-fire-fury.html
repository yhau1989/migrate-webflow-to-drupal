<p>Read about what really matters from the news last week. We provide you the least-biased news about current events so you can go about your day informed, not brainwashed.</p>
<h3><strong>What to&nbsp;avoid:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>It’s going to be incredibly hard to avoid this one, but please, ignore the President’s tweet about the size of his button. Learn why the tweet doesn’t really matter by reading our standalone post here:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://freewheelus.com/trumps-button-vs-kims-button/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump’s Button vs. Kim’s Button</a></strong>.</li>
 	<li>Another item to avoid for the week is the pandemonium over a book coming out about Trump’s fitness for office. The book isn’t widely read and vetted yet, thus we don’t know what really matters inside it, or what type of impact it’ll have. Remember, any sort of removal from office is a political affair, meaning that while the Republicans own Congress, the Trump-fans can most likely breathe easy, and the Trump-haters shouldn’t hold their breath.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What to&nbsp;focus on:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>What you should focus on is what’s actually happening in North Korea, not the tweets about it. After reading our post linked above which will give you the context of the situation, you should focus on what’s currently happening.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/kim-says-north-korea-s-nuclear-weapons-will-prevent-war-n833781" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>N</strong><strong>orth Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently gave a speech in which he threatened the U.S. and struck a softer tone with South Korea.</strong></a>&nbsp;Kim stated the U.S. mainland is within range of the North’s nuclear weapons (the genesis of the nuclear button stuff) but also said he hopes the olympics would be a “success”.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2127074/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-serious-about-peace-or-just-playing" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Many aren’t sure of how genuine the North’s attempt at dialogue is, wondering if it’s simply a ploy to drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea and loosen some international sanctions.</strong></a></li>
 	<li>Regardless of one’s beliefs in trickle-down economics or one’s position on the tax-reform bill, it’s good to give credit where credit is due. Some companies (including about 40+ major companies) have made moves that benefit their employees due to the tax reform bill’s passing.&nbsp; Some of the companies are&nbsp;<a href="http://about.att.com/story/att_tax_reform.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AT&amp;T</strong></a>&nbsp;<em>($1,000 bonuses to 200,000 employees; $1 billion increase in capital expenditures)</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflac.com/about-aflac/newsroom/press-release-story.aspx?rid=883" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Aflac</strong></a>&nbsp;<em>(increase 401(k) match from 50% to 100% on the first 4% of compensation plus one-time $500 contribution to every employee’s 401(k); $250 million increase in overall U.S. investment)</em>,&nbsp;<a href="http://news.aa.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/American-Airlines-to-distribute-1000-to-each-team-member/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>American Airlines</strong></a>&nbsp;<em>($1,000 bonuses for every employee (excluding officers).

 	<li>The Trump Administration is expected to cut aid to Pakistan due to a tweet from President Trump stating, “<em>The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!</em>” Many agree with this while some feel it’ll only escalate tensions in both the Middle East and in the India/Pakistan dispute. A great article to read up on the effects of a cut and on possibilities of Pakistani retaliation can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42579077" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
 	<li>Iran has been dealing with some major protests over the last week, mainly stemming from economic issues and income inequality between the royals and the masses. As of December 7,&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/irans-guard-claims-victory-anti-government-protests-52189733" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the Revolutionary Guard claims to have stifled the anti-government protests</strong></a>. The protests clearly had an effect on the government of Iran, leading to a tweet about them from the account held by the Supreme Leader&nbsp;Ali Khamenei.</li>
