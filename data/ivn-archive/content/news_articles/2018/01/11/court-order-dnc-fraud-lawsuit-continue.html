<p>DNC lawsuit lawyers Jared and Elizabeth Beck announced on social media Wednesday that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has found sufficient jurisdiction to continue the class action lawsuit against the DNC and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://disobedientmedia.com/2018/01/breaking-court-order-confirms-dnc-fraud-lawsuit-appeal-will-proceed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on Disobedient Media</a>, the court order was <a href="http://jampac.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-10-18-Ord-Grant-Mtn-to-Amd-Complaint.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on JamPac.us</a>, the political action committee run by the Becks. It reads:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="504" src="cloudinary://court-order-dnc-fraud-lawsuit-continue-73606.png" width="723">The class action lawsuit was originally filed in Summer 2016 after it was clear that DNC officials actively worked to minimize Bernie Sanders' campaign in favor of Hillary Clinton. A massive WikiLeaks <a href="https://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">email leak</a> not long after confirmed what many Sanders supporters long suspected: they had been duped.</p>

<p>Sanders supporters involved in the lawsuit argue that they had given money to a campaign under the assumption that the Democratic presidential primary was being conducted fairly and impartially, and thus were seeking financial restitution.</p>

<p>Yet the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/09/08/dnc-lawsuit-lawyers-file-motion-appeal-dismissal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">party argued</a>, as it has for decades now, that it is a private organization and thus reserves the right to ignore its own rules and pick its presidential nominee if it chooses to.</p>

<p>A federal judge sided with the party, stating:</p>
<p><em>“To the extent Plaintiffs wish to air their general grievances with the DNC or its candidate selection process, their redress is through the ballot box, the DNC’s internal workings, or their right of free speech — not through the judiciary.”</em></p>
<p>The appeals court, however, has found sufficient jurisdiction to move forward with the case and has ordered plaintiffs to proceed with filing their second amended complaint.</p>
