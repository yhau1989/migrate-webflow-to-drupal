<p>The US House passed a long-term extension to Section 702 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> Wednesday. In immediate response, US Sens. Ron Wyden and Rand Paul threatened to filibuster.</p>

<p>Section 702 of FISA authorizes the federal government to conduct foreign surveillance on US soil. Privacy advocates say the language of the bill is so broad that surveillance agencies can "<a href="https://www.eff.org/702-spying" rel="noopener noreferrer">intentionally and inherently</a>" sweep Americans' communications, raising a serious constitutional issue.</p>

<p>For years, Section 702 has been renewed with little debate or review by policymakers, something Rand Paul has taken exception too. He said <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/12/21/rand-paul-filibuster-spending-bill-senator-says-may/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in December</a> that he would filibuster any long-term FISA extension that was pushed through without debate or proper legislative procedure.</p>

<p>Looks like Rand Paul and Ron Wyden are back on the filibuster. This time, on government surveillance authority.</p>
