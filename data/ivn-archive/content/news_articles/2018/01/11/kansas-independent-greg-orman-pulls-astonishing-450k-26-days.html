<p>The exploratory committee for Kansas independent <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/greg-orman" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Greg Orman</strong></a> announced Wednesday that he raised over $450,000 ($452,931 to be exact) in 26 days -- exclusively from individual contributors.</p>

<p>Orman <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/12/06/will-greg-orman-turn-kansas-independent/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the creation of an exploratory committee</a> for a possible run for governor in early December. With his established name recognition, state and national appeal, and fundraising ability, it is possible he could turn Kansas independent.</p>

<p>According to his <a href="https://ormanforkansas.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">exploratory committee</a>, Orman received "464 individuals in 35 states, including 229 Kansans who contributed a total of $192,136 over the 26-day period. Half of all contributions totaled individually $500 or less, and more than 60 percent of all contributors donated online." (<a href="https://ormanforkansas.com/post/independent-greg-orman-raises-450k-in-26-days-from-individual-contributors" rel="noopener noreferrer">From the press release</a>.)</p>

<p>“It’s clear to me that Greg’s relationships with business leaders throughout Kansas and across the country will be a great asset in attracting jobs and revenue when he’s elected governor,” said Tim Owens, a former Republican State Senator and treasurer of the Orman for Kansas Exploratory Committee.</p>

<p>Owens added,&nbsp;“Kansas has always been a bellwether the nation looks to, and the contributions Greg received from 35 states and counting demonstrates strong support for the Independent movement right here at home."</p>

<p>Greg Orman <a href="https://ivn.us/2014/11/04/sen-pat-roberts-survives-close-kansas-senate-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly beat veteran incumbent US Senator Pat Roberts</a> in a one-on-one race in 2014, despite the efforts of Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- his likely GOP opponent in November -- to sabotage his campaign. Now, he is taking on the two-party machine again.</p>
