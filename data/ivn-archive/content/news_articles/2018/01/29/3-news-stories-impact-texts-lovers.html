<p>Read about what really matters from the news last week. We provide you the least-biased news about current events so you can go about your day informed, not brainwashed.</p>
<h4>What to avoid:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>The texts were found! Avoid the mayhem created by the texts between an FBI agent and his lover. The texts contained some damning information for the agent, which ended up getting him removed from Special Counsel Mueller’s team, but as of now that’s the most that’s come from them. Until something else surfaces, don’t worry about texts between an unfaithful man and his love affair.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What to focus on:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-courts-may-address-partisan-gerrymandering-virginia-and-maryland-take-note/2018/01/26/3f234de8-01e5-11e8-8acf-ad2991367d9d_story.html?utm_term=.9eb6bcab535c" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>As the Post puts it, it seems the “judicial branch thinks partisan gerrymandering has gone too far.”</strong></a>&nbsp;We’ve seen courts strike down redistricting maps in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Have the courts finally realized our&nbsp;<a href="https://freewheelus.com/two-party-system-nightmare/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>selfish two-parties are acting just like George Washington warned?&nbsp;</strong></a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/23/bid-save-manufacturing-jobs-trump-signs-tariffs-washing-machines-solar-cells/1058293001/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>President Trump slapped huge tariffs on solar panels and washing machines last week.</strong></a>&nbsp;Some applauded his efforts to attack unfair trade policies, but there’s been quite a bit of backlash. Many, including some prominent Republicans, feel these tariffs are just a tax on the consumer since prices will rise and fear they may cause a trade war. It’s too early to see how the foreign companies, and foreign countries, will respond.</li>
 	<li>Keeping with the topic of trade,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trudeau-announces-trade-agreement-without-u-s/?__twitter_impression=true" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the 11 countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) have agreed to a modified version of the deal without the U.S.</strong></a>&nbsp;The announcement comes one year after the U.S. departed the agreement. President Trump had argued for a renegotiation of the deal, but when he didn’t get it, he pulled the U.S. out. Many are wondering if the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will come to the same result.</li>
