<p>In an order issued on Monday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the district lines “clearly, plainly and palpably” violate the state Constitution and gave the Republican legislature until February 9 to draw new ones.</p>

<p>It is the <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/01/10/nc-gerrymandering-decision-reignites-demand-independent-redistricting-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">second ruling in less than two weeks</a> where a court has struck down an entire state congressional map as unconstitutional and demanded that the state legislature oversee a redraw in time for the November 2018 elections.</p>

<p>However, the U.S. Supreme Court quickly issued a stay last week in the North Carolina case. Two other partisan gerrymandering cases – one from Wisconsin (<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/wisconsin-redistricting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gill v Whitford</em></a>) and <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/07/17/judge-partisan-gerrymandering-cancer-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">another from Maryland</a> (<em>Benisek v Lamone</em>) – are awaiting rulings from the Court this spring.</p>

<p>Republicans in Pennsylvania immediately indicated that they would seek a similar stay; it’s likely to be granted, with both the North Carolina and Pennsylvania cases likely to be affected by whatever the Court determines in&nbsp;<em>Gill</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Benisek</em>.</p>

<p>The difference here, however, is that this is a state ruling based on a reading of a state constitution – so predicting the outcome here based on the other cases could be complicated.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania congressional maps were drawn by the Republican legislature in 2011. They helped tilt the swing state’s delegation in Washington to 13 Republicans and 5 Democrats.</p>

<p>The maps have been a Republican firewall: In 2012, for example, Democrats won almost 100,000 more votes, but still earned less than 28 percent of the seats. Not a single seat has changed hands all decade on these maps.</p>

<p>New maps would likely erase the GOP advantage and create something closer to a 50/50 split, most redistricting experts agree.</p>
