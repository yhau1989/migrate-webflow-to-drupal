searchTitle: Downtown San Diego Partnership Gets a New Leader
-->
<div>

Following the departure of Kris Michel to the Mayor's office, the Downtown San Diego Partnership has found her successor. Betsy Brennan has been named the new President and CEO.

Originally from New York, Brennan returns to San Diego and is considered an innovative leader and land-use expert. Brennan attended USD where she obtained her Juris Doctor, with a specialization in land use.

The Downtown Partnership released a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/369814580/Downtown-Parternship-CEO-Announcement" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that reads in part, "From 2002 to 2008, she worked for San Diego’s first-ever City Council President, Scott Peters; first as a community outreach, policy advisor, and land-use aide, then as Chief of Staff. During this time, Brennan was integral in the transition to a strong-mayor form of government, as well as in the establishment of the roles and policies for the San Diego City Council President’s office."
<p>Craig Benedetto, Chairman of the Downtown San Diego Partnership Board of Directors added,&nbsp;"The CEO selection process was robust. With more than 400 applicants, the committee worked hard to find the candidate who could best lead the Partnership into the future. Betsy really stood out and had all the pieces we were looking for in our next President and CEO."</p>
Brennan begins her position in late February.
