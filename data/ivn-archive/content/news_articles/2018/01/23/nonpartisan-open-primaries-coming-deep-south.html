<p>The Alabama legislature will consider a bill that would change the state's primary election process to a nonpartisan, top-two open primary similar to the systems in California and Washington state.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2018/01/18/alabama-house-bill-would-alter-state-primary-system/1043969001/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The bill</a>, introduced by Alabama State Rep.&nbsp;Mike Ball (R-Madison), would put all candidates -- regardless of party affiliation -- on the same ballot and the top two vote-getters would move on to the general election.</p>

<p>Alabama currently uses a closed partisan system. Voters must re-register as Democrats 36 days before the primary to vote on the Democratic ballot, while voters can declare themselves Republican on primary election day to vote on the Republican ballot.</p>

<p>The system not only greatly limits voter choice, but it also diminishes the voting power of people in the political minority.</p>

<p>“You get in areas that are predominantly Republican or predominantly Democrat, the people on the other side really don’t have a say,” said Ball, in an interview for the Montgomery Advertiser. “For special elections, there’s a really low turnout. This might increase participation.”</p>

<p>The bill, as written, would apply to all elections except the presidential primaries. As expected, the bill is getting pushback from the parties, including Ball's own party.
