<p>Political reformers across America are paying close attention to key elections on November 6. But their focus is not on candidates or political parties. It’s about how Americans vote on ballot measures to unrig the system.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<h3><strong>Voters Not Politicians (Michigan)</strong></h3>
<p>In Michigan, an anti-gerrymandering measure is on the ballot after <a href="https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voters Not Politicians</a> gathered more than 425,000 petition signatures with only volunteers within just 110 days. The <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Michigan_Independent_Redistricting_Commission_Initiative_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">measure</a> creates an independent redistricting commission for congressional and state legislative districts to fix Michigan’s broken redistricting process.</p>

<h3><strong>Fair Maps Colorado</strong></h3>
<p>Initially, there was a possibility of multiple competing anti-gerrymandering ballot measures, one from a group with significant Republican backers and one from a group with significant Democratic backers. Thankfully, these groups came together to form <a href="http://fairmapscolorado.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fair Maps Colorado</a> and leveraged their combined political muscle to get the legislature to refer two anti-gerrymandering measures to the ballot - <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Amendment_Y,_Independent_Commission_for_Congressional_Redistricting_Amendment_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amendment Y (Congressional)</a> and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Amendment_Z,_Independent_Commission_for_State_Legislative_Redistricting_Amendment_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amendment Z (Legislative)</a>. These measures prohibit gerrymandering and create fair and competitive congressional and legislative districts.</p>
<h3><strong>Better Boundaries Utah</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://betterboundaries.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Boundaries</a> led the petition drive to gather more than 150,000 signatures to quality anti-gerrymandering <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Utah_Proposition_4,_Independent_Redistricting_Commission_Initiative_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 4</a> for the ballot. Proposition 4 will fix the broken system by creating an independent citizens’ redistricting commission and new rules to govern the process.</p>
<h3><strong>Clean Missouri</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cleanmissouri.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Missouri</a> led the petition drive to gather more than 340,000 signatures to quality <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_1,_Lobbying,_Campaign_Finance,_and_Redistricting_Initiative_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amendment 1</a> for the ballot. Amendment 1 is a more comprehensive anti-corruption proposal that requires legislative records be open to the public, requires politicians to wait two years before becoming lobbyists, eliminates almost all lobbyist gifts, lowers campaign contribution limits, and ensures that neither political party is given an unfair advantage when new maps are drawn.</p>
<h3><strong>North Dakotans for Public Integrity</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ndintegrity.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Dakotans for Public Integrity</a> led the petition drive to gather more than 38,000 signatures to quality the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/North_Dakota_Measure_1,_Ethics_Commission,_Foreign_Political_Contribution_Ban,_and_Conflicts_of_Interest_Initiative_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Dakota Anti-Corruption Amendment</a> for the ballot. The Amendment increases transparency, roots out conflicts of interest, restricts lobbyist gifts, bans foreign money from elections, prevents personal use of campaign money, closes the revolving door from public official to lobbyist, and holds public officials accountable.</p>
<h3><strong>Represent South Dakota</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.representsd.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Represent South Dakota</a> led the petition drive to gather more than 50,000 signatures to qualify the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Constitutional_Amendment_W,_State_Campaign_Finance_and_Lobbying_Laws,_Government_Accountability_Board,_and_Initiative_Process_Amendment_(2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Dakota Anti-Corruption Amendment</a> for the ballot. The Amendment restricts lobbyist gifts to politicians, bans campaign money from unions and corporations to candidates and political parties, bans foreign money, stops politicians from using public office for personal gain, toughen ethics law enforcement and protects voter-approved laws from legislative meddling.</p>
