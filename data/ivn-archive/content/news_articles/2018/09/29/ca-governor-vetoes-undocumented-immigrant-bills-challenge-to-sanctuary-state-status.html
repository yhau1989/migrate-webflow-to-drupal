<p>San Diego, CA.- The California Legislatures push to turn California an even deeper shade of blue, proved too much even for Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Brown vetoed two bills that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to serve on state boards and commissions, and would have prevented immigration authorities from making arrests inside courthouses.</p>

<p>Sen. Ricardo Lara, who is running for Insurance Commissioner against <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/23/independent-candidate-steve-poizner-california-monopoly/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Steve Poizner</a>, <a href="https://sd33.senate.ca.gov/news/2018-05-01-senator-lara-introduces-bill-allow-all-californians-serve-boards-and-commissions" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced both bills</a>.</p>

<p>After the veto Lara said, “There was a time when Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Catholics were prevented from serving, and California cleared away those barriers,” Lara said. “I predict that this barrier will eventually fall.”</p>

<p>Brown was concerned the proposed law could have unintended consequences. “I believe the prudent path is to allow for that guidance to be released before enacting new laws in this area,” Brown&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>In 2013, Brown vetoed a bill that would have allowed non-citizens who are legal residents to serve on juries.&nbsp; At the time Brown noted, “Jury service, like voting,&nbsp;is quintessentially a prerogative and responsibility of citizenship.”</p>

<p>Governor Brown has <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Jerry-Brown-endorses-a-Democrat-That-s-a-bad-12826525.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a> Senator Lara for the position of Insurance Commissioner.</p>
<h3><strong>Blow To Sanctuary State Law?</strong></h3>
<p>An Orange County judge’s ruled this week that California’s Sanctuary State protections for undocumented immigrants are unconstitutional.Despite that ruling, state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra said Friday the state would continue to uphold its laws.</p>

<p>Becerra wrote in a statement, “Preserving the safety and constitutional rights of all our people is a statewide imperative which cannot be undermined by contrary local rules. We will continue working to ensure that our values and laws like the California Values Act are upheld throughout our state.”</p>

<p>A City Attorney with Huntington Beach, Michael Gates, said the ruling makes California’s 121 charter cities — which includes San Diego — exempt from SB 54, the bill authored by Kevin de León.</p>

<p>“This is a significant victory for the rule of law, the [California] Constitution, the city’s charter authority and other charter cities,” Gates said in a statement, “We will continue to hold Sacramento accountable for unconstitutional state law overreaches. The city of Huntington Beach will not allow Sacramento to violate its constitutionally protected rights.”</p>
