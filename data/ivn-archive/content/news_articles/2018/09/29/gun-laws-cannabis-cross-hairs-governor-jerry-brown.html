<p>San Diego, CA.- Governor Jerry Brown has had a busy week.</p>

<p>Brown signed a flurry of bills and vetoed others, as the 39th Governor of California nears the end of his term.</p>

<p>Among the bills he signed Friday:</p>
<h3><strong>Tighter Gun Legislation</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1100" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Bill 1100</a> now requires all firearms purchasers to be at least 21. California already restricts handgun sales to people 21 and older.</p>

<p>The new law exempts law enforcement, members of the military and people with hunting licenses from the restriction.</p>

<p>Brown also signed a bill to prohibit gun ownership for people who have been hospitalized or otherwise placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for risk of hurting themselves or others twice in one year. That law would let those people ask a court every five years to return their guns.</p>

<p>He also signed a bill to ban people with certain domestic violence misdemeanors from owning guns for life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.firearmspolicy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Firearms Policy Coalition</a>, a gun rights advocacy group,&nbsp;slammed the bill saying,&nbsp;“Governor Brown just told millions of people under 21 that they can fight and die for our state and country with machine guns, but they can’t buy a gun for self-defense in their homes. That’s nuts.”</p>
<h3><strong>Cannabis Education</strong></h3>
<p>Brown&nbsp;signed a couple notable cannabis&nbsp;bills into law as well.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>One grants California cities the ability&nbsp;to approve temporary cannabis festivals,</li>
 	<li>another permits <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2215" rel="noopener noreferrer">veterinarians to legally discuss cannabis</a> treatments for animals with their clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>In San Diego, CBD for pets is a discussion that's beginning to go mainstream.</p>

<p>Several articles have been written about the subject and recently, <a href="https://www.kusi.com/cbd-oil-benefits-for-dogs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">KUSI television</a> hosted <a href="https://vetcbd.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">VETCBD</a>, the dispensary <a href="https://marchandash.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">March and Ash</a> and the dog rescue group <a href="https://www.theanimalpad.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Animal Pad</a>, to showcase groups working together to educate the community on the healing powers CBD oil can have for dogs and cats.</p>

<p>Brown also signed the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1294" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannabis Equity Act</a>.</p>

<p>The bill will further the state’s push for equal opportunity in legal marijuana. Every jurisdiction that has established its own local equity program can now apply for a slice of a $10 million fund set aside by the state for this purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>Bars Close At 2 AM</strong></h3>
<p>A bill to allow bars to stay open until 4 in the morning did not find support at the Governors desk.</p>

<p>California currently lets bars stay open until 2 AM.</p>

<p>In a message Gov. Brown wrote"I believe we have enough mischief from midnight to 2 without adding two more hours of mayhem."</p>
