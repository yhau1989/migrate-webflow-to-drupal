<p>In the current political environment, the perception is that there is much that divides Americans. Yet there is one important thing that unites most people across the political spectrum: the idea that America's political system is not working for the people and something needs to change.</p>

<p>Donald Trump often uses the term "drain the swamp." Regardless of how one feels about the president as a person or leader, <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/september_2018/voters_question_trump_s_ability_to_drain_the_swamp_with_politicians_opposed" rel="noopener noreferrer">most voters agree with the sentiment</a> -- though are not sold that anyone in Washington will do anything about it.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of "In Full Color," I talked with RepresentUs Political Director Dan Krassner about the explosion in reform activism in 2018 as voters take on the political status quo themselves.</p>

<p>Though people tend to have different views on what it means to unrig the system, Krassner believes there have been 9 wins across the US in 2018 so far, including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>In March, automatic voter registration passed in Washington;</li>
 	<li>In Tempe, AZ, voters passed a "dark money" disclosure bill;</li>
 	<li>In April, Maryland and New Jersey passed automatic voter registration;</li>
 	<li>In May, Ohio passed an <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/07/ohio-next-state-end-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-gerrymandering bill</a>;</li>
 	<li>Connecticut joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact;</li>
 	<li>In June, Maine voters <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/18/independents-made-difference-maines-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved ranked choice voting</a> for the second time after lawmakers set it up for repeal;</li>
 	<li>In July, Alaska policymakers passed a voter-backed <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/07/23/conservatives-progressives-unite-powerful-interests-pass-anti-corruption-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-corruption bill</a>; and</li>
 	<li>In August, Massachusetts passed automatic voter registration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn't include the approximately two dozen November ballot measures in states like <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/14/voters-not-politicians-citizens-led-campaign-scores-victory-anti-gerrymandering-fight/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michigan</a>, which has an anti-gerrymandering, citizens redistricting commission on the ballot, and <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/30/gop-insiders-sue-anti-corruption-measure-missouri-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missouri</a>, which has one of the most ambitious political reform amendments in the nation.</p>

<p>"This is how we do it," Krassner says.</p>
<p><em>"The people are taking matters into their own hands -- going around the politicians, passing political reform ballot measures with no politicians required. We are seeing beyond partisanship coalitions come together, get signatures, get laws on the ballot, and win. This is how big movements have sprung up and been successful on national change in the past."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Be sure to check out the full interview above. Something monumental is clearly happening in 2018, and it seems like it is just the beginning.</p>
