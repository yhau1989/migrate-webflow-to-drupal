searchTitle: What Americans Fear Post 9/11
-->
<p>Since September 11, 2001, defending the nation against terrorism has steadily remained a high priority for Americans; an attack is something we very opening fear.</p>

<p>Three months after the attack, which killed nearly 3,000 people, most could have guessed that both political parties, Republicans, and Democrats,&nbsp; would almost mirror each other in wanting national defense from terrorism at the top of the list of congressional and presidential priorities.</p>
<h2><strong>The Partisan Approach to Terror: Then vs Now</strong></h2>
<p>Immediately following the attack, 90% of Republicans and 82% of Democrats agreed that safety and protection for us all came first, and around 7-in-10 have named it as a top priority throughout the 17 studies conducted by Pew Research Center since.</p>

<p>Cut to 2018, and while 73% of American still place defense against terrorism as the top priority, the partisan difference is stark, with 89% of Republicans making it a high priority, compared to 64% of Democrats. (As you might guess, independents were left out of the survey.) This partisan divide is generally the rule when talking about military and anti-terrorism measures, including funding them.</p>

<p>However, this contrasting number might point to something important, now and for the future.</p>
<h2><strong>Enter Edward Snowden</strong></h2>
<p>Nearly 20 years, the perception of what national protection actually is has evolved in the public consciousness.</p>

<p>In 2013, Americans were <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/26/few-see-adequate-limits-on-nsa-surveillance-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to say the government was eating away at civil liberties more than it was protecting them from an attack, and it was nearly a bipartisan agreement on the issue. To that point, this hadn’t been seen in the post-9/11 era.</p>

<p>What would make people say such a thing? Well, the study was conducted around the time that the National Security Administration's domestic spy programs were revealed by the contractor Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>Those fears have not gone away, either. In the fall of 2016, right around election time, a third of Americans said they were more concerned about encroachment on a person’s civil liberties than on outright terrorist protection.</p>
<h2><strong>Big Money</strong></h2>
<p>The number of people worried about civil liberties has jumped since Snowden's revelations and has remained high as our knowledge of data breaches and personal data sales have increased.</p>

<p>In private sector security breaches alone, billions have been affected, and much of this information could easily be used to attack this country:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The Equifax breach affected 143 million people;</li>
 	<li>The Yahoo breach affected 3 billion worldwide;</li>
 	<li>The eBay breach affected 145 million; and</li>
 	<li>Facebook has sold its user data for huge profits, compromising not only our personal security, but national security as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly two decades after the towers fell, it is important to remember that attacks now come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<h2><strong>Some Notes from Internet Users</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Erase:</strong> 86%&nbsp; have attempted to get rid of their ‘digital footprints’</p>

<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> 55% avoid observation by governments, organizations, and people.</p>

<p><strong>No Control:</strong> 91% of adults agree or strongly agree we have lost control of our data.</p>

<p><strong>Theft:</strong> 11% have had personal information stolen (e.g. Social Security numbers, credit cards, or bank account information).</p>
