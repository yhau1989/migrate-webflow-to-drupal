<p>Joe Rogan interviewed US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) in the most recent episode of his podcast,&nbsp;<em>Joe Rogan Experience</em>. Rogan and Gabbard discussed a variety of topics, including the reforms Gabbard believes are needed to create a better election process for voters -- particularly in the primaries.</p>

<p>The conversation stemmed from a discussion on superdelegates, which Gabbard believes is a major part of the problem:</p>
<p><em>"This is something I have been fighting to try to reform within our party is to get rid of superdelegates, to make it so that we have open primaries so that you do not have to be a card-carrying party member to vote in the Democratic primary ... then you have same-day registration..."</em></p>
<p>On the subject of open primaries, Gabbard brought up the problems that many voters ran into during the 2016 elections,&nbsp; where they would show up to vote and were turned away because they didn't register with the party a year or so in advance in some cases -- long before they knew who they even wanted to vote for or who all would be on the ballot.</p>
