<p><strong>WASHINGTON DC</strong> - Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) made reference to Spartacus in day three of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. Booker professed, “This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an, I am Spartacus’ moment.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, the documents Booker was referring to had already been made public. The national GOP twitter page took the opportunity to hit Booker:</p>

<p>Just another turn in the bizarrely political environment usurping this confirmation hearing as Democrats claim they do not have enough documents available to properly vet Kavanaugh for a lifetime post to the nation’s highest court.</p>

<p>Booker released 12 pages of emails online – which had been marked “committee confidential” on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The debate over whether they are confidential took up hours and hours of the hearing.</p>

<p>Claiming he defied Senate rules Booker said, “I am going to release the e-mail about racial profiling, and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.”</p>

<p>The emailed released covered Kavanaugh discussing racial profiling in 2002 when he served as staff secretary in the Bush White House.</p>

<p>Booker is being groomed as a possible 2020 Democratic candidate for president.</p>
