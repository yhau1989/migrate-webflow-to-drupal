<p><em>"It's just gotten to a level that is out of control and something needs to be done." ~ District 2 Councilmember Lorie Zapf</em></p>

<p>San Diego, CA.- In an exclusive interview on IVN Beyond The Headlines, District 2 Councilmember Lorie Zapf called the current process of gathering signatures for referendums and ballot initiatives, "a process of deception, fraud and lies."</p>

<p>Zapf was discussing the recently launched <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/tourism/sd-fi-short-term-rental-referendum-20180807-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">referendum effort</a> to overturn airbnb regulations enacted in July by the council.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="This is what happens, people abuse something and then you have to come down and make it stringent so they aren't abusing it. I can't see how anyone with a straight face can say this is the will of the people." author="Councilmember Lorie Zapf"]

<p>Backers of short-term rentals recently turned in petitions to the county Registrar of Voters to force a public vote on whether the new legislation should be repealed.</p>

<p>Zapf told IVN San Diego, "This is what happens, people abuse something and then you have to come down and make it stringent so they aren't abusing it. I can't see how anyone with a straight face can say this is the will of the people."</p>

<p><em>The entire interview with Zapf will be released soon.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Issue Before Council In 2019</strong></h3>
<p>I asked Councilmember Zapf if signature gathering rule changes is "something the council might take up in 2019?" to which she replied, "I sure hope so, I can bring that forward."</p>

<p>She was very candid on the most pressing issues the City of San Diego faces heading into the November election.</p>
<h3><strong>On Mission Valley</strong></h3>
<p>Councilmember Zapf spoke about her decision to endorse the SDSU West proposal and shared her views on why she thinks SoccerCity is bad for San Diego.</p>
<h3><strong>On City Audit Process</strong></h3>
<p>Eduardo Luna's retirement means the search for a new City Auditor is underway. As Chair of that committee, I asked Zapf how that might impact city business.</p>
