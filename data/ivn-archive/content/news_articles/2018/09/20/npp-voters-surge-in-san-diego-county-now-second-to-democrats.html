<p>San Diego, CA.- In what comes as little surprise, the number of independent or NPP voters in San Diego County has now surpassed the number of registered&nbsp;Republicans.</p>

<p>The numbers are in line with the state numbers as reported by <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/30/purple-wave-independent-voters-swell-pass-republican-registration-in-ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN last May</a>.</p>

<p>There were 509,359 voters who registered as “no party preference” compared to 487,259 registered Republicans, according to the latest numbers from the San Diego County Registrar of Voters.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Democratic Party has 618,088 registrants in San Diego County.</p>

<p>Jeff Marston, is co-chair of the <a href="https://www.independentvoterproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> (IVP). Marston credits the surge in “no party preference” voters to a lack of enthusiasm in the two-party system.</p>

<p>"Frankly, voters have been turned off by the rancor we see at all levels of government. There is no cooperation, there is no compromise, just intense competition and in fact, and at times, all out war. It's about scoring points with your perceived core constituencies and nothing more. Reaching across the aisle for real progress is now a dinosaur. The voter sees this and is turned off."</p>

<p>"This is why you see so much defection from the parties and in the case of new voters, about a two to one ratio, choosing NPP over an established political party."</p>
