<p>In the current political environment, voters are looking for alternative perspectives that challenge the two-sided narrative we get in the media.&nbsp;Nonpartisan and independent news can enable citizens to better understand the political world around them in a way the mainstream media is failing to do.</p>

<p>IVN has <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched its own podcasts</a></strong> to provide people with an independent-minded perspective they cannot find anywhere else -- a perspective that is committed to educating voters, not partisan attacks or providing an echo chamber for one party or the other.</p>

<p>Here are 6 podcasts every independent-minded voter should follow:</p>
<h2>1. IVN Podcasts: Deconstructed, Toppling the Duopoly, and The Business of Politics</h2>
<p>I know, I know... way to self-promote, right? But seriously, IVN is the only source for news and information (that we know of) specifically catered to independent-minded readers, and this includes our selection of podcasts.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast/sets/deconstructed-with-t-j" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Deconstructed</i></a>&nbsp;host TJ O’Hara is IVN’s principal political analyst, a former presidential candidate, and a public speaker who brings his veteran experience in the political space to his podcast, which features guests from across the political spectrum: from a former Perot insider and author to candidates who know what it is like to take on the two-party duopoly.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast/sets/toppling-the-duopoly-with" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Toppling the Duopoly</i></a>&nbsp;— formally <a href="https://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast/sets/in-full-color-election-reform" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>In Full Color</i></a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;is IVN Editor Shawn Griffiths’ podcast, where he brings on the most prominent leaders in the historic nonpartisan reform movement to talk about all the efforts currently underway to give the people a political system that puts the people, first, and doesn’t serve party insiders or special interests.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/independent-voter-podcast/sets/the-business-of-politics-with" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Business of Politics</i></a>&nbsp;is hosted by veteran journalist Lindsay France. Lindsay gets into the business side of our politics, with guests that include representatives from Ballotpedia, PredictIt, professional pollsters, and more! Understanding the business side of the two-party &nbsp;can help people better understand why things are not working in our politics the way they should.</p>
