<p>San Diego, CA.- The online shopping giant Amazon announced Wednesday it is in plans to create 300 technology jobs in San Diego.</p>

<p>The company expects to hire workers in software development, machine learning, cloud computing, fraud prevention and digital entertainment.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/technology/sd-fi-amazon-hiressd-20180905-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Union-Tribune</a>, the deal was driven by Nate Wiger, a USD graduate who was commuting to Amazon’s Irvine campus as a senior manager for Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer issued a statement:</p>

<p>“San Diego is a place where ideas take shape and innovation happens. Our entrepreneurial spirit, innovative culture and top-ranking universities make our city the perfect location for Amazon’s newest tech hub. This new facility is an investment in San Diego’s growing innovation economy, our talented workforce and the relationship we have with one of the world’s leading companies, and I can’t wait to see what exciting new technologies&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;will be developing right here in America’s Finest City.”</p>

<p>The&nbsp;new, 85,000-square-foot Amazon office in University City will bring 300 new jobs to San Diego. The office will open Thursday.</p>

<p>The new building is part of the company’s expansion of their San Diego Tech Hub — the company already employs 200 tech specialists in teams across the city.</p>

<p>The company says contributions from their existing San Diego workforce include the software that powers their AmazonFresh and Prime Now services, and systems that help prevent fraud and abuse on their many platforms.</p>
