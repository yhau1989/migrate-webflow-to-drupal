<p><span>Who would have thought that comedian turned political commentator Jimmy Kimmel (previously, </span><i><span>the Man Show guy</span></i><span>) would become the arbiter of moral behavior.</span></p>
<blockquote><i><span>Hear me out on this,” Kimmel began “So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court, OK? Well, in return we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone.</span></i></blockquote>
<p><span>Jimmy Kimmel, after all, used to ask 18-year-old girls to grab his crotch and began his shows with “girls jumping on a trampoline.” In front of millions of viewers, he treated women, well, terribly.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s just a few moments from Jimmy’s not-so-friendly-to-the-female history.</span></p>
