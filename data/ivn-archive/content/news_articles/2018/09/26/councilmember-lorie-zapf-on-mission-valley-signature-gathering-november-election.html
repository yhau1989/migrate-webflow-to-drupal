<p>San Diego, CA.- District 2 Councilmember Lorie Zapf is on the ballot this November.</p>

<p>First elected to office in November 2010, Zapf served District 6, but switched districts in 2014 due to redistricting.</p>

<p>She has defeated Democrats Howard Wayne and Sarah Boot and is facing Dr. Jen Campbell in November.</p>

<p>On Beyond The Headlines, Zapf discusses the SDSU West and SoccerCity initiatives.</p>

<p>Zapf chairs the Audit Committee, and shares how that role is taking on critical importance with the departure of longtime Chief Auditor Eduardo Luna.</p>

<p>Should she win in November, Zapf says she will push to change City of San Diego Signature Gathering rules as she says the process is now "totally out of control," and shares her views on the failure of the Convention Center expansion initiative to make it onto the November 2018 ballot.</p>
<h3><strong>SDSU West v. SoccerCity</strong></h3>
[pullout_blockquote quote="I've endorsed SDSU West and of the two proposals I think that's the far superior plan. The reason SoccerCity says we give the City more revenue is because it's really dense, it's really dense and it doesn't have anywhere near the environmental or traffic mitigation measures that the SDSU West proposal has" author="Councilmember Lorie Zapf"]

<p>"I've endorsed SDSU West and of the two proposals I think that's the far superior plan. The reason SoccerCity says we give the City more revenue is because it's really dense, it's really dense and it doesn't have anywhere near the environmental or traffic mitigation measures that the SDSU West proposal has, that's why the Sierra Club has also endorsed the SDSU West proposal. It has a really good, robust environmental impact report, statement, but I'm really happy with the riverpark and the mixed-use plan. It's just a really good, well rounded proposal."</p>
<h3><strong>Importance of Audit Committee</strong></h3>
<p>"It's great being the chair of the audit committee, I've been on the audit committee before, but as the chair, you really have a lot of leeway to call on certain audits and making sure the audits are implemented. I can't stress how important this audit committee function is for the functioning of the city. At the end of the day, an outside look, an independent audit really reveals the internal controls that need to be strengthened."</p>
<h3><strong>Changing Signature Gathering Process</strong></h3>
<p>The City Council finally reached a resolution on Short term rentals that many on the City Council thought was a fair compromise. Airbnb did not and along with other groups launched a signature drive to overturn the Council's decision. It's not clear when voters will get the opportunity to weigh in on the vacation rental battle, but the signature gathering process has not sat well with Councilmember Lorie Zapf, who during our interview said of the process: "I am really surprised at the deception and dishonesty of these petition gatherers. It's just gotten to a level that is out of control and something needs to be done. They will do and say literally anything to get that signature."</p>

<p>I asked Zapf if it is something the council make take up in 2019? "I sure hope so," Zapf responded "I can help bring that forward."</p>
<h3><strong>Convention Center Initiative Failure To Make 2018 Ballot</strong></h3>
<p>"I'm gonna be honest, it was a big blow. This could have happened two years ago, a special election and some of my colleagues on the council blocked that because they didn't have particular labor unions on board. I've already talked with the mayor about funding programs for prevention and diversion, we need a lot more housing for foster youth that are aging out, this was a big blow."</p>
<h3><strong>Responding To Opponent Criticism</strong></h3>
<p>Dr. Jen Campbell is running against Zapf. Campbell was recently on Beyond The Headlines and said of Zapf, "She doesn't respond to residents phone calls, emails, concerns."</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="That is one of the most ridiculous statements I have ever heard, ever. I have been so saturated in the community, I am the community" author="Councilmember Lorie Zapf"]

<p>Zapf responded, "That is one of the most ridiculous statements I have ever heard, ever. I have been so saturated in the community, I am the community. I've raised my family here, this is why pretty much every community leader who's not a political animal but a community person has endorsed me. In OB, Mission Beach, PB and Clairemont, everywhere, and to come forward and make these absurd statements is unfortunate. The citizens will decide and I'm confident that the people who are the real community leaders will come out in force for me. I love representing District 2, I have solutions for the problems, I've been here not someone that just arrived here from the east coast."</p>
