<p><strong>Jefferson City, Missouri</strong> - A federal appeals court ruled Friday that a proposed anti-corruption, anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative -- Amendment 1 -- is good to go for the November ballot after a lower court <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/09/14/judge-strips-ambitious-anti-corruption-measure-missouri-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed it</a>.</p>

<p>The decision comes days before the November ballot needed to be finalized to be sent overseas for members of the military and for the first round of absentee ballots.</p>

<p>"We are glad the judges saw through the frivolous arguments of the lobbyists who are terrified of letting Missourians vote on Amendment 1. Reformers across the political spectrum support cleaning up Missouri politics and will be voting yes this November," said Benjamin Singer, communications for <a href="https://www.cleanmissouri.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Missouri</a>.</p>

<p>Clean Missouri garnered over 300,00 signatures to qualify Amendment 1 for the ballot. The amendment bans most lobbyist gifts, puts in place tighter contribution limits on legislative candidates, and institutes a unique method to take redrawing the districts out of the hands of lawmakers and end partisan gerrymandering.</p>
