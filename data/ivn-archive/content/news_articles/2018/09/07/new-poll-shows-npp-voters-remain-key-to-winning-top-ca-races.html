<p>San Diego, CA.- A new poll shows dramatic moves in the Governor and Senate races in California.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-usc-poll-governor-race-20180619-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">early polls</a> showed Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Dianne Feinstein with comfortable leads in their respective races. Those leads are now all but gone.</p>

<p>According to the national polling firm,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.probolskyresearch.com/2018/09/06/newsom-leads-cox-for-governor-but-not-by-large-margin-feinstein-over-de-leon/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probolsky Research,</a> California's two biggest statewide races are tightening.</p>

<p>The leads for front-runners Gavin Newsom and Dianne Feinstein are now single digits.</p>

<p>Newsom now leads Republican businessman John Cox by only 5 points, 44 to 39 percent, with still 17 percent of the poll's participants undecided.</p>

<p>Feinstein's lead over Kevin de León has been trimmed to 8 points, leading 37 to 29 percent. However, 34 percent of respondents remain undecided in that race.</p>

<h3><strong>NPP Voters Will Be The Difference</strong></h3>
<p>As IVN has been reporting, <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/05/could-republican-john-cox-surprise-california-by-picking-up-democrat-and-independent-votes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPP voters</a> will be the difference in both races.</p>

<p>According to the poll, NPP voters in the race for Governor favor the Republican 44 to 37 percent with 19 percent still undecided.</p>

<p>Election experts have stated that if Cox is going to pull an upset, nearly all of those undecided voters will have to go his way.</p>

<h3><strong>No Debates?</strong></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article217618995.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">new report</a> in the Sacramento Bee, suggests we might not get a debate of the gubernatorial candidates. The report states the two camps are deadlocked over terms of a televised debate.</p>

<p>Cox, is pushing for a series of debates. Newsom has agreed to only one, hosted by CNN and nationally televised on Oct. 1. Cox’s campaign hasn’t agreed to the CNN debate.</p>

<p>His team wants to ensure that the debate focuses on six California issues:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The state’s housing shortage</li>
 	<li>cost of living</li>
 	<li>homelessness</li>
 	<li>education</li>
 	<li>clean water and,</li>
 	<li>safe schools</li>
</ul>
<p>Cox also demanded only California journalists moderate a debate.</p>
