searchTitle: New Mexico Supreme Court Blocks Straight-Party Voting
-->
<p><strong>SANTA FE, N.M.</strong> - The New Mexico Supreme Court has rejected Secretary of State&nbsp;Maggie Toulouse Oliver's attempt to implement straight-ticket (aka straight-party or one-party) voting for the November election. In a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-mexico/articles/2018-09-12/new-mexico-supreme-court-weighs-automated-one-party-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer">unanimous decision</a> Wednesday, the court ruled that&nbsp;Toulouse Oliver did not have the authority under state law to take such action.</p>

<p>The court sided with the <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/09/04/n-m-lawsuit-sec-of-states-straight-party-ballot-action-illegal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">plaintiffs' argument</a> that the authority to implement straight-ticket voting belonged to the legislature -- which previously repealed the statute that allowed the ballot option's use.</p>

<p>"Did the Legislature intend to delegate its discretionary authority over straight-party voting to the secretary of state? It clearly did not," said Chief Justice Judith Nakamura</p>

<p>The justices also expressed skepticism over the argument that straight-ticket voting was a tool to speed up the voting process, which advocates claimed would encourage higher turnout and participation in down-ballot races.</p>

<p>"It's not as if a party affiliation at this point is being hidden," said&nbsp;Justice Charles Daniels, pointing out that voters could easily see a candidate's party affiliation next to his or her name.</p>

<p>The secretary of state's&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2018/08/29/new-mexico-reinstates-straight-party-voting-option/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sudden announcement</a> that she was going to add straight-ticket voting was immediately met with broad criticism. It was reported that several counties even revolted against the decision, as county commissioners called on local clerks <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/09/07/new-mexico-counties-revolt-straight-party-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">to ignore it</a>.</p>
