<p>San Diego, CA.- San Diego Mayor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/mayor" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Faulconer</a>&nbsp;has endorsed <a href="https://johncoxforgovernor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican John Cox</a> of&nbsp;Rancho Santa Fe&nbsp;for governor.</p>

<p>A statement from Faulconer read, "We need to reform Sacramento so it’s working for us again. Millions of forgotten Californians face unaffordable housing, struggling schools and the worst poverty rate in the country. It’s time for new ideas to turn Sacramento around, and John Cox is the best choice for the job. He will never stop fighting for our communities."</p>
