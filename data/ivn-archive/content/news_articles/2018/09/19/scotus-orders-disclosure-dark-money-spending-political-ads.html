searchTitle: "SCOTUS Orders Disclosure for \"Dark Money\" Spending on Political Ads"
-->
<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the closure -- at least temporarily -- of a loophole that allows certain nonprofit political groups who spend on political ads to not disclose their donor lists (commonly referred to as "dark money").</p>

<p>The loophole was established nearly 40 years ago by the FEC, and became a focal point for campaign finance reformers after the 2010 <em>Citizens United</em> decision.</p>

<p>The NPR reports:</p>
<p><em>"The court set aside an order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday. The social welfare group Crossroads GPS, a defendant in the lawsuit, had fought to stall disclosure while it prepares to appeal. It failed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and then appealed to the Supreme Court.</em></p>
<p><em>The disclosure requirement is expected to apply to explicitly political ads by nonprofit groups for the remaining weeks of the campaign season."</em></p>
