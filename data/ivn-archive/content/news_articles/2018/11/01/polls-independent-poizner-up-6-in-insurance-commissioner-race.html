<p>San Diego, Calif.- Three recent polls show independent candidate for Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner continuing to lead Democrat Ricardo Lara.</p>

<p>Poizner leads Lara on average 44.5% to 38.7%. He's doing it with NPP voters, as well as Republican voters. Poizner is the overwhelming choice for the GOP. According to the Berkeley poll, it's to the tune of 86%.</p>

<p>If he wins, Poizner would be the first NPP candidate to win statewide office in California.</p>

<p>The three polls are from <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3949w8v3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berkeley IGS</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1YCbo3xkprsfw27DnwL1HebRTYQbozg97/page/3BlY" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN</a>, and <a href="https://us19.campaign-archive.com/?u=fd19d69505045f7e019bb4a7a&amp;id=64b6c033aa" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Partners Strategies/Optimus</a>.</p>

<p>The polls breakdown this way:</p>

<p>This poll uses landline technology. "<em>Between 10/25-10/27, we surveyed 1,068 modeled likely midterm voters in California via IVR, landline only."</em></p>

<p>The poll has Poizner leading Lara by 2 points.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Independent candidate Steve Poizner has been&nbsp;endorsed by every newspaper in California that made an endorsement, including the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and San Diego Union-Tribune. “There’s no room in this job for a partisan politician,” Poizner said.</p>

<p>Senator Ricardo Lara is one of the Legislature’s more liberal members. He co-authored a bill last year to create a state single-payer, universal healthcare plan that would have cost around $400 billion annually. It passed the Senate and was shelved in the Assembly.</p>

<p>Lara also has been a strong advocate for immigrants living here illegally. His bill to allow illegal immigrants to sit on boards and commissions was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>
