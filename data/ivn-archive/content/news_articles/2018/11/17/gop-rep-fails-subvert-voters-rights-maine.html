<p>IVN Author Wes Messamore and I take the Friday before Thanksgiving to talk about civility in the US, and the ability to forgive and lend a hand to those in distress, exemplified by Republican representative-elect and&nbsp; Lt. Commander Dan Crenshaw's response to a widely criticized SNL joke, as well as our broad response to help those who have been <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/15/fire-doesnt-care-who-you-voted-for/" rel="noopener noreferrer">affected by the California wildfires</a>.</p>

<p>In the top news of the week, the results are in for the first US House race to be decided by ranked choice voting, and it was a bad Thursday for US Rep. Bruce Poliquin.</p>

<p>First, Poliquin <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/13/facing-potential-defeat-gop-congressman-sues-stop-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sued to stop ranked choice tabulation</a> after an exit poll showed him losing, attempting to subvert the will of voters and throw the election into chaos. A federal judge Thursday&nbsp;<a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/15/federal-judge-denies-gop-congressman-attempt-stop-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied his request for a temporary restraining order</a>, but the lawsuit remains before the judge.</p>

<p>Then, Democrat Jared Golden beat the incumbent after the second round of ranked choice tabulation with 50.53%, but Poliquin is not exactly taking his loss like a statesman.</p>

<p>Another lawsuit <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/11/14/lawsuit-filed-end-taxpayer-funding-closed-primary-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed this week</a> in New Mexico challenges the public funding of closed primary elections. Wes and I discuss the potential ramifications of this lawsuit, and the impact closed partisan primaries have on the electoral process and representation.</p>
