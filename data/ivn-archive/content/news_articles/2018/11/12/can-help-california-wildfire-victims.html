-->
<p><strong>SAN DIEGO, CALIF.</strong> - The first thing that comes to mind when we see a burning building, people suffering, a community ravaged by disaster is not whether or not we are looking at Republicans or Democrats; conservatives or liberals. We see neighbors. We see families in need. We see fellow Americans.</p>

<p>If there is one thing I know about our society, it is that at our core we are mostly compassionate people. We empathize with each other in times of great tragedy and hardship. We come together to give blood, donate what money and goods we have to spare, and give our time and energy to bring comfort and relief to those who just lost everything.</p>

<p>California is dealing with the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/11/us/california-wildfires-camp-woolsey/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">most devastating and deadly wildfires</a> in the state's history. As of the latest reports, at least 31 people have died, many more have lost their homes, and over 300,000 people have evacuated their communities. Hundreds of people are missing. It is a devastating situation for Californians throughout the state.</p>

<p>Many want to know what they can do to help California wildlife victims. Here are some of the ways people are steeping up:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Lyft is offering free rides&nbsp;</strong>to people in the affected areas.</li>
 	<li><strong>AirBnb is encouraging hosts to offer free rooms</strong>&nbsp;in <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/welcome/evacuees/venturacounty" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ventura</a>&nbsp;(Southern California) and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/welcome/evacuees/buttecounty?irgwc=1&amp;irclid=TueyFQScyxC3WpLXp133nWs6Ukg36rzu8TRawc0&amp;ircid=4560&amp;c=Viglink%20Primary_392845&amp;sharedid=4210298&amp;af=126295512" rel="noopener noreferrer">Butte County</a>&nbsp;(Northern California).</li>
 	<li><strong>AT&amp;T is offering </strong><a href="https://about.att.com/newsroom/2018/hill_woolsey_fire.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>unlimited text, talk, and data sharing</strong></a> in Southern California, including prepaid customers.</li>
 	<li>The Humane Society of Ventura County is<strong> taking in&nbsp;dogs, cats, horses and other domesticated animals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Here is what you can do:</h2>
<p>One of the best things people can do outside of volunteering time, energy, shelter, food, etc. in these areas is to donate money to a nonprofit organization that is providing relief in one way or another. It is said donating money is better than donating resources because volunteers on the ground know the specific goods and resources they need, so they can just go out and buy them.</p>

<p><strong>You can donate to: </strong></p>
