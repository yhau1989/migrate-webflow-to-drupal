-->
<p><strong>AUGUSTA, MAINE</strong> - US Rep. Bruce Poliquin announced Monday that his campaign was officially requesting a hand recount in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, the first House race to be decided by ranked choice voting.</p>

<p>Poliquin and his campaign made the following statement:</p>

<p>Poliquin currently trails Democrat Jared Golden by more than 3,500 votes. Golden was pushed over the 50% threshold after the second round of ranked choice tabulation, garnering 50.53% of the vote.</p>

<p>Yet Poliquin is not taking his loss lying down. He is challenging the constitutionality of ranked choice voting in federal court -- a case that will be heard on December 4. Then there is this request for a hand recount, a process that could take up to 4 weeks, according to&nbsp;Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap's office.</p>

<p>“A ranked-choice recount is not something that we have ever done before, so it’s a rough estimate,” <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/11/26/poliquin-requests-recount-in-2nd-district-race-won-by-golden/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Kristen Muszynski</a>, spokeswoman for Democratic Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap. “But it’s a longer process because of the (ranked-choice) rounds, so the estimate is it will be about four weeks to do the whole recount.”</p>

<p>If the results of the recount are not reversed, Poliquin's campaign will have to bear the cost of the recount. Stay tuned for more updates on this story.</p>
