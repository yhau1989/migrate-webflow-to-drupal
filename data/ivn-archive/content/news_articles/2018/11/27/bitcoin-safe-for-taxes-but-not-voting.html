<p><strong>Washington,&nbsp;D.C.</strong> - Ohio will be the first state in the nation to use blockchain technology for tax payments. Businesses will be able to pay 23 types of taxes via bitcoin.</p>

<p>But if blockchain is secure enough for a government to collect money from companies, why hasn't it been given the green light for widespread use in securing our votes?</p>

<p>West Virginia used a new blockchain pilot program to allow military men and women, as well as their families, to cast their&nbsp;votes in the&nbsp;midterm elections using smartphones. On November 15, Max Warner, West Virginia’s secretary of state reported remote blockchain voting a success in an&nbsp;<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/news/Pages/11-15-2018-A.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">official announcement.</a></p>

<p>Currently, West Virginia ranks 44th of 50 states in&nbsp;voter turnout,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electproject.org/2018g" rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to the United States Elections Project. And according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.symantec.com/blogs/election-security/smartphone-blockchain-voting-technologies-get-big-test-fall" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symantec,</a>&nbsp;18% of the 2 million service members and their families serving overseas received ballots in 2016. Rejections and tardy ballots meant&nbsp;that 11% of those votes counted.</p>
<h2><strong>Security&nbsp;Issues?</strong></h2>
<p>The app secures and stores the digital votes using facial recognition software. It then distributes and stores the votes in a digital lockbox in 16 locations, making it relatively tough for a hacker to access the information.</p>

<p>Amid heightened fears of election meddling, this experiment could help determine whether blockchain has a place in election security. But experts warn that mobile voting comes with risks in preserving anonymity and in transferring votes from smartphones infected with malware.</p>

<p>J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan computer science professor, says this form of voting is hype at this point.</p>
<h2><strong>The Power of Attraction</strong></h2>
 that "[i]t’s important for Ohio to plant the flag as a national leader in blockchain technology."<p>Where West Virginia wants to attract voters with blockchain, Ohio wants to attract more business. Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel told the <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/26/ohio-becomes-first-state-accept-bitcoin-taxes/2112697002/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati Enquirer</a></p>

<p>Businesses will only be charged a 1% payment fee compared to 2.5% for credit card payments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;West Virginians&nbsp;stationed in Egypt, Mexico, Japan, Albania, Botswana, and two dozen others were able to have their voices heard via the biggest blockchain-based voting test ever.</p>
<p>“It’s already been very successful,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/06/west-virginians-countries-have-voted-by-mobile-device-biggest-blockchain-based-voting-test-ever/?utm_term=.f97ac86590bc" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Michael Queen, deputy chief of staff to West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner. “We’re very pleased with the participation.”</p>
<p>Based on the high level of security required to carry out both tax payments and voting, it seems entirely feasible that blockchain technology could be used on a broader scale very soon.</p>
