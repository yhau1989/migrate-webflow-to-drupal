<p>San Diego, Calif.- <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/24/close-advisor-tulsi-considering-2020-presidential-run/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumors</a> that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is planning a 2020 presidential run will likely grow after she took aim at President Trump Wednesday over his comments regarding the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who disappeared after entering the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey.</p>

<p>Gabbard's comments came a day after <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-saudi-arabia-20181121-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Trump</a> indicated that Saudi Arabia would not face severe consequences over Khashoggi's death.</p>
<h3><strong>Gabbard Gets Criticism</strong></h3>
<p>Gabbard's twitter post has drawn some criticism as critics point to her meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, a man who has chemically <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/syria-gas-attack-echoes-assads-gamble-that-gains-outweigh-risk-1523301273" rel="noopener noreferrer">gassed women and children</a>.</p>
