<p>In an interview Friday, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's independent challenger, Tim Canova, told me he's ready for a legal battle over the election results next week, especially given the history of underhanded electioneering tactics the congresswoman was at the center of at the DNC, and in the 2016 congressional primary against Canova.</p>

<p><strong>Wes: What's your reaction to the recent private GOP poll <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/31/debbie-wasserman-schultz-danger-losing-seat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing you are tied with Debbie Wasserman Schultz</a> among voters in your district?</strong></p>

<p>Tim: "I don't know what to make of it. I haven't seen the poll. I've only read the reports. But it was obviously encouraging news!"</p>

<p><strong>Wes: With the Republican candidate trailing so far behind and with this GOP poll showing your campaign tied with Wasserman Schultz, has there been any talk of the Republican stepping out and endorsing you?</strong></p>

<p>Tim: "I spoke to him recently. No, he's not going to be dropping out."</p>

<p><strong>Wes: Is vote rigging against you a concern again this election with the county supervisor meeting with Wasserman Schultz?</strong></p>

<p>Tim: "They were campaigning together a few days ago. It is a concern. In light of what happened during my primary against her in 2016, and we wanted to inspect the ballots, and the ballot supervisor <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/14/judge-ballots-wasserman-schultz-race-illegally-destroyed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">destroyed all the ballots</a>."</p>

<p><strong>Wes: Any preventative measures going into this election?</strong></p>

<p>Tim: "The governor said he's putting a monitor in her office, but that's actually routine. They've had monitors before and it doesn't seem to have had an effect in preventing the ballot destruction and maybe rigging of the softwareâ€“ we don't know.</p>

<p>We do have election experts and one of the nation's leading recount lawyers coming to town. So we're hoping those folks will be able to help prevent those things. If need be I think they'll be ready to file a lawsuit seeking a recount. We hope it doesn't come to that, but we're also going to be prepared."</p>

<p><strong>Wes: Any final message for voters before election day?</strong></p>

<p>Tim: "This is obviously a very important race for independent voters. And we appreciate all the support we're getting from people around the country. And please support us the best you can at Tim Canova Dot Com."</p>
