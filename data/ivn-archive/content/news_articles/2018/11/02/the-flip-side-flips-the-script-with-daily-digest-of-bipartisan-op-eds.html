<p>From midterm predictions, to the migrant caravan, to foreign relations, <a href="https://theflipside.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Flip Side</a> is keeping it real.</p>

<p>It’s a newsletter digest of op-eds and analysis from liberal and conservative media. The founder The Flip Side, Annafi Wahed, and her team scour editorials from both sides of the political spectrum to bring you the legitimate views from both sides of the aisle so you can get a clear view of the other side’s perspective - no matter your bias.</p>

<p>Much like IVN, The Flip Side is on a mission to help bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives, to become a news source for liberals, moderates, independents, conservatives, and even the apolitical.</p>

<p>Wahed&nbsp;acknowledges that while most people aren’t going to switch from their favorite news source,s whether its Fox, CNN, or MSNBC, if everyone takes 5 minutes a day to read The Flip Side, we’ll have a starting point when talking to our friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>Wahed sat down with IVN to fill us in on that made her want to put this together, her past work in politics and how people have reacted to what the Flip Side brings to the conversation.</p>
