<p>San Diego, Calif.- Another election, another Florida controversy.</p>

<p>Florida is on its way for a machine recount in both the Senate and gubernatorial races in Broward county.</p>

<p>Brenda Snipes and Broward county have had a long history of controversies involving vote counting:</p>
<h3><strong>2000 Presidential Election</strong></h3>
<p>Arguably the most well-known of these controversies. Broward county played a central role in the confusion during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida" rel="noopener noreferrer">2000 presidential election</a>. The "hanging chad" riddle was eventually solved by the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3><strong>2016 Ballot Destruction</strong></h3>
<p>A circuit court judge ruled Snipes broke federal and state law by <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/12/15/experts-browards-elections-chief-broke-law-in-destroying-ballots-150258" rel="noopener noreferrer">too quickly destroying ballots</a> from the August 2016 primaries earlier this year. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz won the race by a narrow margin, which was the subject of a lawsuit by candidate Tim Canova.</p>
<h3><strong>2018&nbsp; Gubernatorial Election</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly 25,000 <strong>more</strong> votes were cast for governor than for the Senate, a discrepancy larger than the current Senate race margin of Sen. Bill Nelson and Rick Scott.</p>

<p>The Broward County ballot was designed so the Senate race appeared in the lower left-hand corner, below the instructions, spurring a theory that many voters simply missed the contest.</p>
<h3><strong>Republicans Call For Investigation</strong></h3>
<p>Republicans got a boost Friday when a judge ordered Broward county had to turn over voter information to Scott's campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee under Florida's open records laws.</p>

<p>President Trump claimed Broward County was "probably getting ready to do a 'number'" and turn the election against Scott and De Santis, the Republican candidates running for Senate and Governor. Both currently hold a slim lead.</p>

<p>Also said Friday, more lawyers would be sent to Florida to counter Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, who is representing Nelson's campaign.</p>
<h3><strong>Democrats Call For Vote Counts</strong></h3>
<p>Incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson filed a lawsuit to extend Saturday's deadline for county canvassing boards to submit their unofficial results.</p>

<p>In a statement released Friday, Nelson said Rick Scott was abusing his office by trying to stop a complete and accurate counting of all the votes. “The reason why he feels that way is obvious: we believe when every legal ballot is counted we’ll win this election."</p>

<p>Nelson trailed by around 15,000 votes, or 0.18 percent, below the state’s 0.25 percent threshold for a hand recount.</p>
<h3><strong>Weeks of Drama?</strong></h3>
<p>The recounts and possible legal challenges mean it could be weeks until a winner is determined in either race.</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed by Nelson and Democrats notes that “thousands of eligible Florida voters” could see their rights violated under the state’s signature-matching requirements, citing research suggesting that ballots submitted by black and young voters are disproportionately rejected using that standard.</p>
