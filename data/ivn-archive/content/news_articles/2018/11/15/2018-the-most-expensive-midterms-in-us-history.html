-->
<p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</strong> It’s official. This year was the costliest midterm election in US history. Outside spenders forked out $1.31 billion. That’s an increase of 61% over the 2014 midterms. The total over-all cost of $5.2 billion is a 35% jump over 2014.</p>

<p>The political advertising side of a campaign is a massive investment. Rhetoric filters into living rooms across America at all hours of the day and night, while a candidate&nbsp;gives a stump speech to a crowd of thirty.</p>

<p>According to Advertising Analytics, TV and radio advertisements racked up more than $3.27 billion in 2018, which more than doubles the $1.5 billion spent on midterm contests four short years ago.</p>
<h2>Digging for Election Gold with Ad Dollars</h2>
<p>If TV is still king of political advertising, then radio is a prince. Democratic candidates and groups spent $1.5 billion (52.3% of the total) on TV and radio, Republicans spent $1.3 billion (47.5%), and independents spent $5.8 million (0.2%).</p>

<p>The two most generous outside spenders in the nation were the Republican group, Congressional Leadership Fund, and the Democratic group, Senate Majority PAC. They spent $110 million and $105 million, respectively.</p>

<p>Republican messaging placed greater concentration on the economy and taxes. Democrats&nbsp;aired nearly 1 million broadcast ads centered on health care and outspent the GOP by a total of $100 million.</p>

<p>Exit polls <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls" rel="noopener noreferrer">show</a> that more than 41% of voters said their number one issue was health care, and 69% said the current system needs "major changes."</p>
<h2>Online 24/7</h2>
<p>According to Kantar/CMAG, estimated online ad spending totaled about $900 million compared to about $250 million in the 2014 midterms. This relatively new medium is an operative’s dream, as it gives campaigns and financial backers the capability to adjust formats, messages, and styles rapidly.</p>

<p>They have greater access to voters too, crowding the screen on your device even as you stand in line at the polls. And this form of outreach comes with rock-bottom prices.</p>

<p>According to a study by&nbsp;<a href="https://online-pol-ads.github.io/Online-Political-Ads-Analysis/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York University</a>, advertisers representing federal candidates using Facebook spent<strong>&nbsp;</strong>$153-$600 per ad with an average impression of&nbsp;1,100-4,800 each. Google had the higher prices, averaging $ 1,800 each, but handed over&nbsp;6,300 impressions.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-06/facebook-google-are-election-ad-winners-despite-meddling-outcry" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Facebook made $354 million on 2 million ads. Its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/report" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ads Archive Report</a> offers a breakdown of who spent what for political ads on its platform.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;More Money More Problems in Florida</h2>
<p>The most expensive races in the country were Florida's $181 million gubernatorial race and its $171 million Senate race. Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott has been locked in a contentious recount effort since Election Day to unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.</p>

<p>The latest numbers show that Scott leads Nelson with a 12,562-vote margin. Federal courts are set to decide deadlines for recount procedures. And tight margins in the race&nbsp;for governor means a recount as well between Republican Governor-elect Ron DeSantis and Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum.</p>
