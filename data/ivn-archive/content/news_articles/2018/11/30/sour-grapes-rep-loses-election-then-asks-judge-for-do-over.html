<p>In the latest podcast episode of In Full Color, independent author Wes Messamore, IVN Business of Politics Editor Lindsay France, and I discuss the latest development in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, where US Rep. Bruce Poliquin has filed an amended motion to get a new election for his district.</p>

<p>A federal judge is set to hear arguments in the lawsuit on December 4. However, it seems unlikely the judge will order a new election because the congressman is disgruntled over his loss to Democrat Jared Golden. Golden's attorney called Poliquin's lawsuit "sour grapes."</p>

<p>Bringing an independent perspective to some of the biggest stories of the week, Lindsay, Wes, and I also discussed:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The ongoing debate over how the government treats migrants seeking asylum at the US's southern border;</li>
 	<li>The Senate's vote to advance a resolution that would end our involvement in the proxy war in Yemen between Saudi Arabia and Iran -- a war that has killed tens of thousands of innocents; and</li>
 	<li>What these issues could mean for future elections, including the 2020 presidential election.</li>
</ul>


<p>Be sure to leave any comments, questions, feedback, or reviews. We want to hear from you. Thanks for listening, and as always... stay independent!</p>
