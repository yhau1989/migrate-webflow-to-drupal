<p>In a special episode of "In Full Color," IVN Author Wes Messamore and I discuss the history made in the 2018 midterm elections, and what it means for independent-minded voters going forward:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>An independent candidate is on the cusp of making history in California, but the blue wave has made it a too-close-to-call race.</li>
 	<li>National polls missed the mark in some congressional races like CA-10, where Republican US Rep. Jeff Denham held on to his seat in an extremely tight race.</li>
 	<li>Speaking of polls, it turns out the poll that showed US Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Tim Canova tied was inaccurate, and possibly even a ruse for some GOP insiders.</li>
 	<li>Immigration and Kavanaugh. One issue may have cost the Republicans the House, while the other may have cost 3 Democrats their seats. Wes and I discuss what might have happened on Election Day.</li>
 	<li>And, the most overlooked story in the 2018 elections will be the electoral and political reforms passed to create a fairer, more accountable, better representative process for voters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several reforms were approved by voters across the country Tuesday, as part of a historic nonpartisan reform movement taking the nation by storm.</p>
