<p>San Diego, Calif.- Ohio Gov. John Kasich might be changing his tune when it comes to running for president as a third-party candidate.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivn.us/2018/03/22/kasich-schwarzenegger-appealing-to-npp-voters-and-toxic-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last March in Los Angeles</a> at the "New Way California" event, I asked Kasich if he would consider a third-party run for president, he denied having interest.</p>

<p>Then this week on ABC's "The View," Kasich noted,&nbsp;“I think, for the first time, there is a legitimate chance for a third-party candidate."</p>

<p><em>Gov. John Kasich Considering Independent Run For President</em></p>

<p>Kasich painted both parties as “extremes” and suggested that the path forward would need a viable middle ground.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="All of my options are on the table. A third-party candidate is possible because you have the Republicans on the extreme and the Democrats on the extreme, there’s a big, wide open space in the middle." author="John Kasich, Ohio Governor On 2020 Presidential Run"]

<p>"I don’t know. I mean, all of my options are on the table. You know, in the Republican Party pretty hard because it’s kind of locked down right now and we don’t know what’s going to come in the future. But a third-party candidate is possible because if you have the Republicans on the extreme and the Democrats on the extreme, there’s a big, wide open space in the middle."</p>
<h3><strong>An Independent Campaign</strong></h3>
<p>Meghan McCain asked if he’d consider running an independent campaign.</p>

<p>“Right now, you know, Meghan, I don’t know,” but Kasich maintained America is ready for a&nbsp;third-party option. “Maybe that’s why people are ready for a third party,” he said. “I’m not saying that for sure but it might be so."</p>
