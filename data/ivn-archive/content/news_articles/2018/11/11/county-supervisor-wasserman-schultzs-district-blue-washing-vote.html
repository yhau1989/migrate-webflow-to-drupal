<p>Tim Canova, the independent candidate running against Debbie Wasserman Schultz for Congress has been closely watching the election results in Broward County– where the the county supervisor has already <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/14/judge-ballots-wasserman-schultz-race-illegally-destroyed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">been convicted</a> by a Florida judge of illegally destroying ballots in 2016, yet kept her job and is in charge of counting the votes in Broward County again this election(!).</p>

<p>Canova said on Fox News Sunday that something suspicious is happening in Broward County again this year, with a U.S. Senate seat on the line, and depending on how some other close U.S. Senate races resolve– maybe even Republican control of the Senate.</p>
