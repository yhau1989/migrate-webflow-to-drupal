<p>The establishment Democrats prevailed in California's most visible 2018 statewide elections for governor and the U.S. Senate:</p>

<p>The race between hedge fund manager John Cox (R) and Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom (D) to fill vacating governor Jerry Brown's office in the state capitol; and incumbent Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's challenge from the left, by Democratic State Sen. Kevin de León.</p>

<h2>Feinstein Trounces de León</h2>

<p>Feinstein has represented California in the nation's Senate since 1992, when she rode the Clinton wave to win a special election. With over 90% of California precincts reporting, she trounced de León, leading leading the state senator by nearly 9 points. </p>

<h2>Newsom Wallops Cox</h2>

<p>Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom represents continuity with the Jerry Brown administration. In the wake of widespread perception that his Republican opponent, John Cox, is out of touch with California values (<a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/08/2018-california-governor-candidates-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the governor's debate transcript here</a>) Newsom walloped Cox at the voting booth with a 20-point victory.</p>

<h2>Poizner Trailing in Close Race</h2>

<p>In the California Insurance Commissioner race, closely watched by independent voters across the nation, the race is likely a Poizner defeat with 95% of precincts reporting and independent candidate Steve Poizner trailing Ricardo Lara by 1.6 points. We're still waiting on Riverside and San Diego County reports.</p>

<h2>Prop 6 Gas Tax Repeal Defeated</h2>

<p>Californians voted down Proposition 6 Tuesday.</p>

<p>The ballot measure would have repealed an increase to the gas tax and vehicle fee for the Golden State's drivers.</p>

<p>Outgoing Governor Jerry Brown, who urged voters to reject the ballot measure, saying that it would halt necessary repairs for the state's roads and bridges, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-proposition-6-gas-tax-increase-repeal-20181106-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">hailed the vote</a> as a watershed moment because voters themselves chose to raise their own taxes:</p>

<blockquote>"This is one of the most significant votes in America tonight, because where else have people voted to tax themselves to pay for what they need?"</blockquote>

<h2>Prop 8 Dialysis Profit Cap Defeated</h2>

<p>An initiative <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/24/economics-californias-prop-8-dialysis-pricing-ballot-initiative-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer">to cap profits for kidney dialysis companies</a> failed at the ballot booth Tuesday, with 61% of voters rejecting the measure. </p>

<p>It was the most expensive proposition on the California ballot in 2018, with $130 million <a href="https://abc7news.com/politics/california-voters-reject-measure-to-limit-dialysis-profits/4634675/" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised</a> to promote or fight it.</p>

<p>The labor unions and health workers that supported the proposition argued it would improve the quality of service for patients. They raised $18 million to support their campaign.</p>

<p>Dialysis companies and the health workers that opposed Prop 8 argued it would result in clinic closings and worse service for patients. They poured $111 million into defeating it.</p>

<h2>Prop 10 Rent Control Defeated</h2>

<p>A proposition to expand rent control in the state of California was also one of the more expensive ballot measures this year, and <a href="https://abc7news.com/politics/ca-rejects-rent-control-expansion-initiative-aimed-at-states-housing-crisis/4634255/" rel="noopener noreferrer">was defeated</a> by voters Tuesday.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/08/prop-10-the-big-battle-to-remove-limits-on-rent-control/" rel="noopener noreferrer">would have overturned</a> a 1995 law that prohibits California cities and counties from enacting or expanding rent control.</p>

<p>Supporters were hoping to provide relief to renters of apartments, condominiums, and single family homes in California's expensive real estate market.</p>

<p>Opponents argued the measure would remove incentives for developers to continue building residences in an already under-supplied real estate market.</p>
