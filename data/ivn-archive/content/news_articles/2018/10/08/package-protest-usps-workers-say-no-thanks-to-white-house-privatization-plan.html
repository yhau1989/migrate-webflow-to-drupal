<p><strong>SAN DIEGO, CALIF.</strong>- <em>"US Mail Not For Sale"</em> is a chant being heard across the country this week, as the White House discusses plans to possibly privatize the USPS.</p>

<p>The White House wants to make the USPS profitable by restructuring its pricing.</p>

<p><em>Congresswoman Susan Davis' Office</em></p>

<p>About 50 postal service workers gathered in front of Congresswoman Susan Davis' office on Adams Avenue in San Diego Monday to voice their displeasure.</p>

<p>Organizers told IVN San Diego that if the plan goes through, businesses, consumers and the economy will be at risk.</p>

<p>One letter carrier told IVN San Diego,&nbsp;"This privatization plan would likely impact people's pockets, first and foremost. Whatever you've seen as far as universal service will definitely go way up. We'll more than likely lose service because cost will go up."</p>
<h3><strong>Trump Administration Looking To Trim Costs</strong></h3>


<p>President Trump said the privatization proposal is in place to reorganize the federal government. He has said the USPS is on "an unsustainable financial path" and "must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout."</p>

<p>In 2017, the <a href="https://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2017/pr17_069.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">USPS operated at a 2.7 billion deficit,</a> and 65 billion since 2007.</p>

<p>President Trump has said the "frieght Amazon is paying" to have their packages delivered by USPS workers is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Local unions are concerned what a move to privatize the industry will mean for quality paying jobs. A local union labor leader told me, "USPS is the centerpiece of the $1.3 trillion national mailing industry, which employs 7 million Americans in the private sector. Postal jobs would be at stake, including the 1 in 4 employee who is a military veteran."</p>
<h3><strong>Congresswoman Davis Supports USPS Workers</strong></h3>

<p>In a speech to supporters, Congresswoman Susan Davis vowed to fight the administration's efforts to push the USPS private.</p>

<p>Davis told IVN San Diego, "this service shouldn't be privatized. A lot of these folks have been working for the USPS forever, this is probably one of the most reputable public services that we have and yet we have some movements now to privatize and diminish their service, and they don't want to do that and they believe in what they do and I think the American people believe in it to."</p>
