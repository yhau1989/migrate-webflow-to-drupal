<p>San Diego, CALIF.- Very quietly an initiative has been placed on the 2020 ballot that if passed, would require voters countywide to approve large housing developments in the backcountry.</p>

<p>As we have seen with other proposed developments that are placed on the ballot, see the <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/nov/08/measure-b-lilac-hills-ranch-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer">"old" Lilac Hills Ranch</a>, it is all but impossible for those projects to pass.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://saveoursdcountryside.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">initiative supporters</a>&nbsp;comprise 12 area environmental groups and the <a href="https://my.lwv.org/california/san-diego" rel="noopener noreferrer">League of Women Voters</a>.</p>

<p>The current Board of Supervisors, four of the five, have gone on record opposing the referendum.</p>

<p>The initiative, circulated by the <a href="https://saveoursdcountryside.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safeguard Our San Diego Countryside</a> group, was placed on the ballot in 2020 because the signatures, collected earlier this year, were too late to have it voted on this November.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="If this passes, what do we need a Board of Supervisors for?" author="County Supervisor Bill Horn"]

<p>California law stipulates the initiative must be placed on the ballot.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for at least one Supervisor to question the initiatives wisdom. Bill Horn noted,&nbsp;“I don't have a problem putting this on the ballot," but he cautioned, "If this passes, what do we need a Board of Supervisors for?"</p>

<p>Horn isn't far off as arguably, the most critical decisions the County Board of Supervisors make regard land-use.</p>

<p>The County currently has 13 large General Plan amendments in the pipeline, half of which would require voter approval if this measure is approved.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Developments in the Crosshairs</strong></h3>
<p>Warner Ranch and the new <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/08/new-lilac-hills-ranch-gets-unanimous-approval-county-planning-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilac Hills Ranch</a> developments are scheduled to go before the supervisors for approval in December. If approved, it's very likely neither will get a shovel in the ground&nbsp; before 2020.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newlandco.com/newland-communities/our-communities/newland-sierra/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newland Sierra,</a> which received approval last month will not need voter approval. However, opponents of that development <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/sd-no-newland-signatures-gathered-20181017-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">have turned in</a> signatures for a separate measure that would overturn the supervisor’s approval. The supervisors unanimously approved the 2,135-unit housing project late September, with Dianne Jacob absent. They said the project would help with our affordable housing crisis.</p>

<p>That could also appear on the March 2020 ballot.</p>
<h3><strong>County Staff Report</strong></h3>
<p>An impact report regarding the initiative was prepared by county staff, and the report painted a grim picture for additional housing projects. As an example, “Voters from National City to the City of Oceanside would decide whether a GPA within the incorporated community of Julian” would be approved.</p>

<p>Importantly, the report also says the measure is consistent with the goals of encouraging development near urban areas or in areas of the unincorporated county called <em>villages</em> where higher density is desired.</p>

<p>Environmental groups, who partly paid for the initiative have derided the report saying it&nbsp;will be used by the building industry and opponents as a marketing tool.</p>
