<p>San Diego, CALIF.- 1.7 million Floridians could soon have ballot access who didn't before.</p>

<p>Amendment 4 is a ballot initiative for the sunshine state that would allow felons the ability to vote.</p>

<p>The lone exception would be for those felons who have been convicted of murder and rape.</p>

<p>The initiative has the support of major interest groups on both the right and the left, including the ACLU and Americans For Prosperity.</p>
<h3><strong>Democrats Set To Gain</strong></h3>
<p>Amendment 4 could have national implications and turn the state of Florida blue for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Consider this.</p>

<p>President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Florida by about 113,000 votes in 2016.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Rick Scott defeated former governor Charlie Crist by fewer than 65,000 votes.</p>

<p>Restoring voting rights to 1.7 million convicted felons could fundamentally alter the outcomes of battleground elections.</p>
<h3><strong>Poll Suggests Amendment 4 Will Pass</strong></h3>
<p>A <a href="http://news.wjct.org/post/unf-poll-71-percent-florida-voters-support-amendment-4-restoring-felons-voting-rights" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> conducted about a month ago by the University of North Florida suggests Florida voters overwhelmingly support Amendment 4.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">2002 study</a>&nbsp;suggested that for every 10 votes cast by felons, seven would have gone to the Democrats.</p>

<p>If&nbsp; Amendment 4 were to pass, it could lead to 400,000 new registered voters in the state of Florida by 2020, and experts point to the fact that the overwhelming majority of whom would vote Democrat.</p>

<p>The state of Florida requires 60% approval for passage.</p>
