<p><strong>LANSING, MICH.</strong> - The Voters Not Politicians campaign sent out a press release Wednesday confirming that 19 radio stations in Michigan have pulled ads against its anti-gerrymandering amendment that the organization calls "misleading."</p>

<p>"The radio spot, funded by the Michigan Freedom Fund, falsely claimed that Proposal 2 'writes a blank check' to members of the independent citizens redistricting commission created under the proposal, and that 'they can spend whatever they want' In fact, under the proposal, Commission funding would be subject to appropriation and approval by the Legislature and is subject to a veto from the Governor," the group states.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voters Not Politicians</a></strong> says radio stations under the&nbsp;Michigan Brownfield Network pulled the ad after receiving "<a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/votersnotpoliticians/pages/201/attachments/original/1539958474/VNP_Station_Letter_10_19_18_1015am.pdf?1539958474" rel="noopener noreferrer">factual information from the Voters Not Politicians legal team</a>." The ad also received a "foul" rating&nbsp;Bridge Truth Squad, and it is not the first time the Michigan Freedom Fund has been called out for <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-truth-squad/truth-squad-video-attacks-michigan-redistricting-proposal" rel="noopener noreferrer">a false and misleading pro-gerrymandering ad</a>.</p>

<p>“Lies told by special interests invested in our current rigged system – the very individuals and groups who orchestrated and benefit from Michigan’s gerrymandered voting districts – are yet another attempt to mislead and confuse voters so they can maintain the status quo,” said Katie Fahey, founder and executive director of Voters Not Politicians.</p>
<p><em>“Proposal 2 puts more power in the voters’ hands, making politicians accountable to us, not lobbyists or special interests. We’re confident that when voters know the facts about Proposal 2, they will vote YES on Nov. 6.”</em></p>
<p>Voters Not Politicians is the campaign behind Proposal 2, which is proposing a citizens' redistricting commission to take control of redistricting out of the hands of partisan politicians, and put into the hands of the people. Proposal 2 is one of 4 anti-gerrymandering proposals on the ballot in the US.</p>
