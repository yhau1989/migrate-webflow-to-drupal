<p>San Diego, CALIF.- Add San Diego to the list of cities impacted by reports of suspicious devices.</p>

<p>The San Diego Union-Tribune was evacuated Wednesday morning following the discovery of a suspicious package, according to San Diego Police.</p>
<p>The building is located near 6th and B streets in downtown San Diego and houses additional offices other than the paper's newsroom.</p>
<p>Police closed 6th Avenue between A and B streets.</p>
<p>According to the Union-Tribune, a bystander flagged down a San Diego police lieutenant after spotting five boxes on a table in front of 600 B Street about 8:15 a.m.</p>

<p>In addition to the local paper, the building houses an office for Senator Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The discovery prompted the closure of several busy blocks. But about an hour later, police determined the packages were filled with one shoe, two children’s books, one football, one empty bag of chips and one hat.</p>


<div>Police said their response was precautionary, considering the discoveries that were made across the country. On Wednesday, the Secret Service intercepted a series of suspicious packages containing potential explosives that were sent to Hillary Clinton and President Obama.</div>
<div></div>
<div>CNN also reported a suspicious package was sent to its building in Manhattan.</div>
