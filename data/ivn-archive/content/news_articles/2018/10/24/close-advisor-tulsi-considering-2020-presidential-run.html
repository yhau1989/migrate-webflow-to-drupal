<p><strong>SAN DIEGO, Calif. - </strong> Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is officially considering a 2020 presidential run.</p>

<p>According to reports, Rania Batrice, a close adviser to Gabbard and deputy campaign manager on Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, has been putting out feelers for digital and speechwriting staff for Gabbard.</p>

<p>When asked by reporters about the possibility, Batrice did not dispute that Gabbard is considering joining what’s expected to be a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders. Batrice said, “I think everybody is focused on 2018, but we will see what happens after that, someone like Tulsi, with her experience, is an important voice in the party and the country.”</p>

<p>Gabbard has not responded to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<h3><strong>Popular Independent Candidate</strong></h3>
<p>As proven at the <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/02/09/why-do-trump-supporters-love-democrat-tulsi-gabbard/" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNRIG summit</a> last year in New Orleans, Gabbard would be a popular candidate with independents, and Trump supporters as her keynote was a rousing success.</p>

<p>As a fiercely independent, anti-establishment, military veteran, Rep. Gabbard has a lot in common with a&nbsp;pro-Trump profile. Her willingness to work with President Trump, as well as others outside her party, puts her in a unique position on the left&nbsp;and her likability appears to transcend party — a combination that could possibly create&nbsp;a politician&nbsp;who Bernie and Trump supporters alike can rally behind.</p>

Tulsi Gabbard"]

<p>As for her 2020 moves, Gabbard recently visited Iowa, where, according to the <a href="https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/2018/10/15/democratic-candidates-call-bipartisanship-key/1644692002/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iowa City Press-Citizen</a> locals urged her to run for president.&nbsp; At the event Gabbard said,&nbsp;"All politics is local.&nbsp;As long as you are not trying to play the partisan game, but you are actually speaking to the needs of the people in our community, and then&nbsp;successfully able to do that, you are giving people a reason to vote, it all starts here at the local level."</p>

<p>And she’s writing a book due out this spring titled, “<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/tulsi-gabbard/is-today-the-day/9781478914785/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Today the Day?: Not Another Political Memoir.”</a></p>

<p>A 37-year-old Iraq War veteran, Gabbard won her House seat in 2012 and became the first Hindu to serve in Congress.</p>
