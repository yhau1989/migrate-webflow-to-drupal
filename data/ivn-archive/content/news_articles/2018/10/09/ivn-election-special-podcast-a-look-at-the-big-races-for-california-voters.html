-->
<p>Welcome to the IVN Election Special Podcast: A Look at the Big Races For California Voters.</p>

<p>The future of California will go to the voters on November 6th, and voters are energized.</p>
<p>Californians are registering to vote in record numbers. Nearly 1.5 million more people are registered to vote than were in the last midterm election in 2014, according to the California Secretary of State’s Office.</p>
<p>More than 19 million Californians were registered to vote on September 7, that's nearly 76 percent of all eligible voters in the state. It is the highest number of voters ahead of a midterm election in state history.</p>
<p>Besides choosing a new governor, California voters are also deciding on other statewide officials, including will an independent be elected to statewide office for the first time ever?</p>
<p>U.S. senator, 100 state legislators, 53 members of Congress, 11 ballot propositions and hundreds of local government officials are also on the ballot.</p>
<p>Yes, there is much at stake.</p>

<p>It's a lot to digest and we have just the group to sift through the noise.</p>
<h2><strong>IVN Podcast: CA November 6th General Election Special</strong></h2>
<p>Former CA Senator Steve Peace and IVN Business of Politics editor Lindsay France joined me to discuss the California election.</p>

<p>Each shared their thoughts on the Governor’s race, the U.S. Senate, the broken process of confirming Bret Kavanaugh, and what surprises might be in store!</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the conversation:</p>
