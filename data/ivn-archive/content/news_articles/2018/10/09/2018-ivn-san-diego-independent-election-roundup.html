<p>Measures E, G and H impact City of San Diego voters, Measures E and G focus specifically on the Mission Valley initiatives, Soccer City and SDSU West.</p>

<p>Measure H considers establishing term limits for San Diego Unified School Board Members. The Charter has not included term limits for School Board members since section 66 was enacted in 1931.</p>

<p>Measure D is for County of San Diego voters. The Full Voter Participation Act focuses on a charter amendment that would change elections for the county and mirrors what Measures K and L did for the City of San Diego in 2016.</p>

<h2><b>Congressional District 49 -&nbsp;<em>Mike&nbsp;</em></b><b><i>Levin (D) v. Diane Harkey (R)</i></b></h2>
<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>Central to the Democrats desire to take back the house in November is a strong showing in California. California is home to seven GOP-held seats that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. The 49th District, which includes parts of San Diego County and Orange counties, is one of them. Voters here backed Clinton by 7 points while re-electing GOP Rep. Darrell Issa by less than 1 point. Issa is retiring and going to work in the Trump administration.</span></p>

<p><span>Polling in the contest between Republican Diane Harkey and Mike Levin shows a very close race, some polls show Harkey up, others have Levin ahead.</span></p>

<h2><b>Congressional District 50 -&nbsp;<em>Duncan&nbsp;</em></b><b><i>Hunter Jr. (R) v. Ammar Campa-Najjar (D)</i></b></h2>
<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>Congressional District 50 grabbed national headlines when prosecutors charged Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter Jr. and his wife with prohibited use of campaign contributions, wire fraud, conspiracy, falsification of records and aiding and abetting. Hunter and his wife have pleaded not guilty, the trial is expected to begin in December, after the election. Hunter has represented the 50th District since 2013.

<h2><em><strong>Measure D -&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>General Election Consolidation Initiative - FULL VOTER PARTICIPATION ACT</strong></em></h2>
<h2><i>Ballot Statement</i></h2>
<p>“INITIATIVE MEASURE PROPOSING CHARTER AMENDMENTS REQUIRING ALL ELECTIONS FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY ELECTIVE OFFICES TO BE HELD AT A GENERAL ELECTION AND REQUIRING ADOPTION OF LOCAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO WRITE-IN CANDIDATES FOR COUNTY ELECTIVE OFFICE Shall this initiative measure, proposing county charter amendments requiring all elections for San Diego County elective Offices to be held at a general election and requiring adoption of local regulations relating to write-in candidates for county elective office, be adopted?”</p>

<h2><i>Why It Matters</i></h2>
<p>IVN is covering Measure D because voter participation is a critical component to a healthy democracy. If passed, Measure D will do for the County of San Diego what Measures K and L did for the City of San Diego in 2016. Voters passed measures K and L with a comfortable margin. Currently in the County of San Diego, if a candidate or measure receives 50%+1 of the vote in the primary, the race is over, eliminating the possibility that the majority of the electorate, who participate in the November General election, do not get to weigh in on the race.</p>

<h2><em><strong>Measure E - Mission Valley Stadium - SOCCER CITY Initiative</strong></em></h2>
<h2><em>Ballot Statement</em></h2>
<p>“MISSION VALLEY STADIUM - SOCCER CITY INITIATIVE: Shall the City lease Mission Valley stadium property and the San Diego Chargers practice facility on Murphy Canyon Road to a private party for 99 years, with an option to buy some stadium property, consistent with price, terms, and conditions described in the measure; and adopt a specific plan and agreement allowing development of stadium, river park, recreational, residential, office, hotel, retail, and other uses; and amend related land use laws?”</p>

<h2><em>Why It Matters</em></h2>
<p>Mission Valley is a real estate jewel for San Diego. It’s an opportunity to re-envision 166 acres that for so many years, served primarily as a sports complex. Soccer City is one of the initiatives before voters. The team that crafted the initiative, FS Investors, promise the development of a new soccer stadium, MLS team, river park, residential and office space, and hotel and retail opportunities. Soccer City would also get access to the former San Diego Chargers practice facility on Murphy Canyon Road.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Measure G - Mission Valley Stadium - SDSU West Initiative</em></strong></h2>
<h2><em>Ballot Statement</em></h2>
<p>“MISSION VALLEY STADIUM - SDSU WEST INITIATIVE: Shall the City sell Mission Valley stadium property to San Diego State University or any SDSU auxiliary organization, entity, or affiliate, consistent with price, terms, and conditions described in the measure, to allow the California State University Board of Trustees to determine its development, which may include stadium, recreational, educational, residential, office, hotel, retail, and other uses; and if sold, shall the City set aside adjacent land for a river park?”</p>

<h2><em>Why It Matters</em></h2>
<p>Founded in 1897, San Diego State University has been a critical resource for the community for generations. By all accounts, the university is looking for room to expand, and have targeted the Mission Valley site as an opportunity for those growth plans. Supporters of the SDSU West initiative say their project comes at no cost to city taxpayers, would transform the existing stadium site into a walkable campus environment with housing, classrooms, a research park, hotels, retail and a stadium, featuring 90 acres of public open space and a river park.</p>

[anchor title="measureh"]
<h2><strong><em>Measure H - San Diego Term Limits for School Board Members - SAN DIEGO UNIFIED</em></strong></h2>
<h2><em>Ballot Statement</em></h2>
<p>“CHARTER AMENDMENT ENACTING TERM LIMITS FOR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. Shall City Charter section 66 be amended to limit a member of the San Diego Unified School District Board of Education from serving more than three four year terms, beginning in 2020, and not count prior or current terms for purposes of the term limit for those School Board members who hold office on the date of the Municipal General Election in 2020?”</p>

<h2><em>Why It Matters</em></h2>
<p>Measure H would amend the Charter to impose a term limit on School Board members beginning in 2020. The Charter amendments would limit School Board members to serving three four-year terms. The Charter has not included term limits for School Board members since section 66 was enacted in 1931. This ballot measure was proposed by a School Board member during a process where members of the public submitted ballot measure proposals for consideration by a Council standing committee and then the full City Council. The City Council voted to place the measure on the ballot.</p>
