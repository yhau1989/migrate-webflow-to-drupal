<p>San Diego, CALIF.- 49 signups.</p>

<p>That's the result of the City of San Francisco's effort to register non-citizen voters for local board of education races.</p>

<p>The 49 signups come to about $6,326 per sign up.</p>

<p>The program is the first-of-its-kind in California and followed the passage of a 2016 San Francisco <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco,_California,_Non-Citizen_Voting_in_School_Board_Elections_Amendment,_Proposition_N_(November_2016)" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballot measure</a> opening school elections to non-citizens who are over the age of 18, city residents and have children under age 19.</p>

<p>Back in July, the city began registering non-citizens — including undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>The tab has so far totaled about $310,000 setting up the new registration system and encouraging people to sign up. At the time it was placed on the ballot, the City Controller Ben Rosenfield noted Proposition N would cost an estimated $160,000 per election to print and distribute voting materials, train poll workers and separately register people who would become eligible to vote in School Board elections.</p>
<h3><strong>Controversial Move</strong></h3>
<p>The effort has been a controversial one.</p>

<p>And one likely to rally conservative voices as the caravans continue their march to the border.</p>

<p><a href="https://shamannwalton.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shamann Walton</a> is the San Francisco Unified School District commissioner who introduced the resolution to the school board in support of Measure N in 2016. She said he doesn’t buy into the "concerned" rhetoric, “At the end of the day, for me, it’s important that families who have children in our school to have a say,” he said.</p>

<p>Robin Hvidston, executive director of <a href="https://wethepeoplerising.wordpress.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">We the People Rising</a>, a group that lobbies for stricter immigration enforcement said of the effort,&nbsp;“Non-citizen voting is a very contentious issue,” Hvidston said. “The move to extend voting rights to those illegally residing in San Francisco has the potential to backfire among citizens with a moderate stance on illegal immigration.”</p>
