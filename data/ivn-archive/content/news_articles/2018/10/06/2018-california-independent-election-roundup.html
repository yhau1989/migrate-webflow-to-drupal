<p><span>We are focusing our coverage on California because California’s “top two” nonpartisan primary reform has produced some interesting matchups that could produce historic results.</span></p>

<p><span>In the US Senate race, incumbent Dianne Feinstein is <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/07/20/wanna-bet-dem-v-dem-general-election-oust-26-year-incumbent-us-senator/" rel="noopener noreferrer">running against a fellow Democrat</a>, who falls further to the left of the political spectrum than her, without her party’s support. In the race for state insurance commissioner, Steve Poizner is positioned to be the <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/05/poized-to-make-history-ca-voters-can-elect-npp-candidate-in-november/" rel="noopener noreferrer">first No Party Preference candidate to win statewide office</a>. In the race for governor, independent voters are creating a <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/05/could-republican-john-cox-surprise-california-by-picking-up-democrat-and-independent-votes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more competitive race</a> than pundits expected.</span></p>

<p><span>There are so many things at stake in the 2018 elections, and California is changing the way we look at electoral competition. Voters outside the dominant political party in several races will decide the winner. The <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/02/ca-registration-report-independent-voters-cross-5-million-mark/" rel="noopener noreferrer">continued growth</a> in No Party Preference voters is changing the game at all levels. </span></p>

<p><span>IVN is here to put these changing election dynamics into context so voters can make informed decisions at the ballot box. </span></p>

<h2><b>State Senate District 22 -&nbsp;<em>Mike&nbsp;</em></b><b><i>Eng (D) v. Susan Rubio (D)</i></b></h2>
<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>State Senate District 22 is a deep blue district in Los Angeles County. Republican registration is approximately 19%. However, what often gets overlooked is the huge No Party Preference population -- making up 30% of the registered voter population, and this race comes down to a party-backed and endorsed candidate (Eng) versus a candidate outside the party establishment (Rubio). These candidates need support from outside the Democratic Party to win.</span></p>

<h2><b>Superintendent of Public Instruction -&nbsp;<em>Tony&nbsp;</em></b><b><i>Thurmond v. Marshall Tuck</i></b></h2>
<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>Californians will be choosing a state superintendent of public instruction this November. Though the office of Superintendent is nonpartisan, the top-two open primary system in California allowed for two Democrats to finish atop the June ballot. The primary was exceedingly close, with Tuck edging Thurmond 37% to 35.6%. Tony Thurmond is a state assemblyman from Richmond, Marshall Tuck is a school executive who has run charter schools and alternative district schools in Los Angeles. </span></p>

<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>Central to the Democrats desire to take back the house in November is a strong showing in California. California is home to seven GOP-held seats that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. The 49th District, which includes parts of San Diego County and Orange counties, is one of them. Voters here backed Clinton by 7 points while re-electing GOP Rep. Darrell Issa by less than 1 point. Issa is retiring and going to work in the Trump administration.</span></p>

<p><span>The proposition requires companies that operate dialysis clinics to pay back insurers any profits over 15 percent of qualifying business costs. Supporters argue that these companies are raking in huge profits while several complaints have been filed with the state about these clinics. Meanwhile, opponents say this </span><span>is really an abuse of the initiative process by a labor union seeking to organize Dialysis Center employees.</span></p>

<h2><b>Proposition 10 -&nbsp;</b><b><i>"Local Rent Control Initiative"</i></b></h2>
<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>Prop. 10 is developing into a huge battle as rent control advocates and those opposed dig in their heels. Since 1995, under the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, Californians who rent apartments, single-family homes or condominiums have had limited protections from rising prices. That could change if voters pass Proposition 10 in November. The ballot measure would let cities and counties expand or enact rent control by overturning the 1995 law. And the debate comes as affordable housing continues to be a challenge for many Californians.</span></p>

<h2><b>Top-Two Election Reform</b></h2>
<h2><i><span>Why It Matters</span></i></h2>
<p><span>The nonpartisan, top-two primary has changed not only the way elections are conducted in California, but the way we look at elections and electoral competition. The system replaced a partisan system with the private purpose of selecting party nominees, to a nonpartisan system with the public purpose of narrowing the field of candidates down to the most viable candidates among all voters. Since Proposition 14 passed in 2010, we have seen elections become more competitive and the votes of the political minority strengthen, including in 2018 where voters outside the political majority will decide statewide legislative, congressional races, and the election for US Senate. </span></p>
