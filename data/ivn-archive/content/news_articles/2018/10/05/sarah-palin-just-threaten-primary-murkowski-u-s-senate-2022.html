<p>In a 51-49 vote Friday to advance Brett Kavanaugh to a confirmation vote for the Supreme Court this weekend, Lisa Murkowski was the only Republican to break ranks with her party and vote, "No."</p>

<p>"He's not the right man for the court at this time," Murkowski <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/05/politics/kavanaugh-nomination-vote-friday/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a>, declaring that she will also vote against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation Saturday as well.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Sarah Palin tweeted at Murkowsi: "@LisaMurkowski - I can see 2022 from my house..." a reference to a Saturday Night Live sketch from the 2008 presidential election in which Tina Fey played Sarah Palin and said she could see Russia from her house:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/lisamurkowski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">@LisaMurkowski</a> - I can see 2022 from my house...</p>— Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahPalinUSA/status/1048288254422728704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2018</a></blockquote>


<p>The pointed tweet was a warning that voters will remember Murkowski's decision when she's up for reelection in four years, and that she may face a primary challenge from the right–&nbsp;but it leaves one to wonder whether that challenge may come from Palin herself, who has basked in the national political spotlight, and has a long running intrastate, instra-party feud with the Murkowski family.</p>

<p>Palin ousted Lisa Murkowski's father, Frank Murkowski to become governor in 2006, handing the incumbent Republican governor a stunning defeat by a 30 point lead in the 2006 Republican primary, and gloating on Twitter, "Do you believe in miracles?" when Lisa Murkowski lost her own primary in 2010.</p>

<p>(The senator kept her seat that year by running a successful write in campaign, an extreme rarity in U.S. Senate history.)</p>

<p>Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins (R-ME) who have been closely watched, and aggressively lobbied by activists and politicians on both sides as swing votes in the Kavanaugh nomination proceedings, were both yes votes today.</p>
