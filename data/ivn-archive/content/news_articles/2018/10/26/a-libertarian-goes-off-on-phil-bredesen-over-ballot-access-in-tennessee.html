<p><strong>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</strong> - <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/tn/tennessee_senate_blackburn_vs_bredesen-6308.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most polls show</a> Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) leading FMR Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) in the 2018 Tennessee Senate race. Bredesen for Senate recently ran a Facebook Ad with a quote from a New York Times op ed saying, "At stake in the Bredesen-Blackburn race is the durability of a Tennessee tradition of electing temperamentally sound senators."</p>

<p>That post prompted a Tennessee Libertarian Party member frustrated with the two party system's iron grip on the ballot to go off on the former governor about a ballot access process in Tennessee that is arbitrary, capricious, and clearly biased in favor of the two party establishment. Here's what he said:</p>

<p><em>"Complete BS. It's about ignoring the TN constitution clause guaranteeing Tennesseans 'free and equal' elections by moving the goal post every time a third party manages to get over a hurdle. D's and R's? 25 signatures to get on the ballot. Anyone else? 2% of the voters. No, wait, 5%. No wait, you had to have your signatures turned in before today, even though there wasn't a date mentioned before. No, wait, we can't put a libertarian on the ballot because it's too expensive.</em></p>

<p><em>That's literally the ballot access process in TN, and we're sick of it. THAT is why there are 30 libertarians running as independent in TN this year." -Brandon McNaughton</em></p>
