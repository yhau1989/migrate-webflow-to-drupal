<p><strong>JEFFERSON CITY, MISSOURI</strong> - The Clean Missouri campaign released a press release Friday announcing that their proposed good government constitutional amendment picked up its seventh newspaper endorsement ahead of the November 6 election.</p>

<p>Clean Missouri announced that the&nbsp;Joplin Globe joined a large trans-partisan list of endorsements to Amendment 1 that also includes 6 other newspapers:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20180720/tribunes-view-gerrymandering-in-missouri-is-practice-that-needs-to-end" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia Daily Tribune,&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.myleaderpaper.com/columns/lobbyists-have-motives-for-handing-out-all-those-perks/article_1fdb6c2c-ccce-11e8-8dd0-8376098c5b3b.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jefferson County Leader, </a><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article170869577.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kansas City Star,&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.stlamerican.com/news/editorials/vote-yes-on-amendment-to-help-clean-up-missouri-politics/article_fa50fa7c-ccf9-11e8-9617-cf764268a6bc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Louis American,&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-petition-drive-aims-to-give-missouri-voters-a-chance/article_db2dd160-1bd8-519d-bc3b-f6130ffb9780.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Louis Post-Dispatch, </a><a href="http://www.emissourian.com/opinion/editorials/clean-missouri/article_3ebe6570-554d-11e8-bfb6-9713e07a4039.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Missourian.</a></p>

<p>“Missouri’s legislative districts are redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. census. We agree with the goals of proponents, who want a more transparent, nonpartisan mechanism that results in more competitive districts. That would be good for democracy statewide. Currently, about 90 percent of Missouri’s districts are not competitive, meaning they are either safe Democratic or safe Republican seats. This undermines lawmaker accountability to voters," <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-petition-drive-aims-to-give-missouri-voters-a-chance/article_db2dd160-1bd8-519d-bc3b-f6130ffb9780.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes the Joplin Globe</a>. “We recommend a ‘yes’ on Nov. 6.”</p>

<p>Amendment 1 takes a comprehensive approach to cleaning up politics in Missouri. It includes proposals that limit campaign contributions to state legislative candidates, places limitations on the revolving door between state policymakers and lobbyists, requires state legislative records to be open to the public, and implements nonpartisan redistricting reform,</p>
