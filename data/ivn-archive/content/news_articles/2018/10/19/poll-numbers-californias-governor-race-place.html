<p>Depending on which pollster you ask as California voters begin to turn in their ballots, Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom's bid is wrapped in an aura of inevitability – OR wealth management financier John Cox, Newsom's opponent in the governor's race, is dramatically closing the gap between them.</p>

<p>Whence cometh the difference?</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the same day <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/endorsements/la-ed-newsom-governor-endorsement-20181016-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">it endorsed</a> Newsom, the Los Angeles Times published the results of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-usc-latimes-poll-governor-20181017-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">a survey</a> it conducted with USC Dornsife, which found "54% of likely voters in the state favored Newsom for governor compared to 31% who support Cox. The remainder were undecided."</p>

<p>That poll found a whopping 23-point gap between Newsom and Cox, but another recent poll, conducted by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article219033960.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">found that</a> 51% of voters favor Newsom while 39% said they planned on voting for Cox.</p>

<p>That's still a lead for Newsom, but a much less dramatic 12-point lead. And between the number of undecided voters in these polls, margins of error, and the inscrutable humor of the electorate these days –&nbsp;that would mean the California governor's race is still in play.</p>

<p>One might attribute the marked difference in the survey results to the California governor's debate, which took place on October 8 via radio (read <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/08/2018-california-governor-candidates-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN's transcript here</a>) after the PPIC poll was published. Perhaps a number of voters changed their minds after hearing the candidates debate. But the Los Angeles Times survey was conducted from September 17 through October 14.</p>

<p>IVN's <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/1YCbo3xkprsfw27DnwL1HebRTYQbozg97/page/UGqY" rel="noopener noreferrer">own survey</a> of California voters found an even narrower gap in the governor's race of 4%, with 48% favoring Newsom, and 44% favoring Cox, with 8% not sure. In these interesting times one should be reluctant to make predictions.</p>
