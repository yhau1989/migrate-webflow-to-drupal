<p>In the latest episode of "In Full Color," IVN Editor Shawn Griffiths discusses a new voting method with Sara Wolf, campaign manager for <a href="https://www.starlane.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">STAR Voting for Lane County</a> in Oregon that could change the way we look at elections.</p>

<p>Imagine you could rate candidates on the ballot like you rate your Uber driver or a product on Amazon? That's the idea, and advocates say it gives all voters an equal vote, provides a more accurate and more representative look at how voters view each candidate, and elects the best candidates.</p>
