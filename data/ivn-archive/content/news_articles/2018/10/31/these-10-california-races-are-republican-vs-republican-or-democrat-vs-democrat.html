<p>In 2018's midterm election, California voters will be choosing between a Republican and another Republican or a Democrat and another Democrat in ten California midterm election races, including three statewide races: for U.S. Senate, Lt. Governor, and Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>

<p>This is an odd and interesting result of the revolutionary election reform California voters adopted in 2010, the top two open primary system. Unlike traditional elections, in which the winners of partisan primaries advance to the general election ballot, a top two open primary is an open, non-partisan primary in which every registered voter picks from among the entire field of candidates, and the candidates with the top two vote totals square off for elected office on the general election ballot in November.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Without party brand distinctions to act as proxies for diligent research and critical thought, voters might actually have to make a decision based on the candidates and issues." author="IVN Author, Wes Messamore"]

<p>This reform is helping to break the spell of the two party system, and beginning to sort out some of the political dysfunctions that arise from the two party system.</p>

<p>For one, the all-or-nothing march in lockstep with party power players and ideologies that was once a requirement for advancing in politics, is already becoming a thing of the past, and well-credentialed candidates with substantive policy platforms who don't want to play that game can <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/26/independents-arent-spoilers-anymore-another-look-californias-top-two-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer be written off as spoilers</a> in California's elections.</p>

<p>The fact that <a href="https://ivn.us/tag/steve-poizner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an independent candidate</a> may win a statewide office in California this year is proof.</p>

<p>But even the ten California Republican vs. Republican and Democrat vs. Democrat races that are listed below (with a brief summary and update) are not merely an odd side effect of a parochial election process. These are good for California voters and California politics, because they are happening in districts that lean far to one side.</p>

<p>The old process allowed the primary voters (usually the most partisan) of one party to ultimately pick the office holder.</p>

<p>Now the entire registered electorate can weigh in on which of two Republicans or Democrats should hold office.</p>

<p>And without party brand distinctions to act as proxies for diligent research and critical thought, voters might actually have to make a decision based on the candidates and issues.</p>

<h2>U.S. Senate: Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) vs. Kevin De Leon (D)</h2>
<p>In a race <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/26/mail-bombs-tulsi-2020-kavanaugh-revenge-week-nonpartisan-news/" rel="noopener noreferrer">which could see</a> many Republicans in California voting for a Democratic candidate who's left of Sen. Dianne Feinstein just to get some turnover in Washington, De Leon has an uphill battle against the incumbent, but one IVN commentator called his recent debate performance <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/10/18/de-leon-had-one-shot-to-score-big-feinstein-he-failed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">strangely subdued</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="495" src="cloudinary://video-92079.png" width="774"></p>
<h2>Lt. Governor: Edward Hernandez (D) vs. Eleni Kounalakis (D)</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/30/skelton-why-california-lieutenant-governors-race-matters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent op ed</a> in Mercury News bluntly states the significance of this race: "The winner of the race between Hernandez and Kounalakis will be positioned to run for governor."</p>

<p>Kounalakis and Hernandez are both Democrats who disagree with tuition hikes and want to increase CAL Grant funding, but whose campaign funding differs dramatically.</p>

<p>California Senate District 22 is an open seat this year, vacated by Sen. Edward Hernandez as he makes his bid for Lt. Governor of the Republic of California. Although both are Democrats, Eng has the support of the Democratic Party machinery in this race, including the official party itself and several establishment Democratic politicians, while Rubio <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/09/27/susan-rubio-mike-eng-fierce-independent-challenges-rank-file-democrat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">hopes to unite a coalition of independent voters</a>, independent Democrats, and Republicans.</p>
<h2>California Senate District 24: Peter Choi (D) vs. Maria Elena Durazo (D)</h2>
<p>You may have heard that State Sen. Kevin de León is vacating his seat to run in California's Senate race this year, leaving Senate District 24 to a contest between small business owner Peter Choi and labor union organizer Maria Elena Durazo.
