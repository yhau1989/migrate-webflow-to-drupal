<p>San Diego, CA.- Central to the Democrats desire to take back the house in November is a strong showing in California.</p>

<p>California is home to seven GOP-held seats that&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&nbsp;carried in 2016.</p>

<p>The 49th District, which includes parts of San Diego County and Orange counties, is one of them. Voters here backed&nbsp;Clinton by 7 points while re-electing GOP Rep.&nbsp;Darrell Issa&nbsp;by less than 1 point. Issa&nbsp;is retiring and going to work in the Trump administration.</p>
<h3><strong>The Polling</strong></h3>

Some polls have <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/internal-poll-harkey-has-slight-lead-over-levin-in-californias-49th-district" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harkey by a couple points</a>, others have <a href="https://mikelevin.org/democrat-mike-levin-has-initial-edge-in-49th-congressional-district-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Levin with a lead</a>.</p>
