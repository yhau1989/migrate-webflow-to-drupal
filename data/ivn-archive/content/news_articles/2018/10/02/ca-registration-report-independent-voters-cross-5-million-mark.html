<p>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla released the latest voter registration numbers Tuesday. The report shows that the number of No Party Preference (independent) voters -- the second largest voting bloc in the state -- continues to climb, and has surpassed 5 million voters.</p>

<p>No Party Preference voters now make up <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/60day-gen-2018/county.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">26.75% of the registered voting population</a>. Voters registered NPP jumped 252,534 voters from the last report dated&nbsp;<a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/15day-stwddirprim-2018/county.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21</a>. It is, however, important to note a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>It is difficult to determine exactly how many of these new NPP voters are a result of the state's new automatic voter registration system (called Motor Voter), but</li>
 	<li>The trend toward larger independent voter registration existed before the implementation of automatic voter registration.</li>
</ol>

<p>This also does not include the many voters who may be unintentionally registered with the American Independent Party -- which <a href="https://ivn.us/2014/04/01/campaign-warns-independents-fooled-american-independent-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous reports</a> suggest could be as high as <a href="https://ivn.us/2014/04/01/campaign-warns-independents-fooled-american-independent-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">90% of its registered members</a>.</p>

<p>The deadline to register to vote for the November midterms is October 22. Eligible voters who miss the registration deadline may still have an opportunity to cast a ballot under the state's new "<a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/23/what-is-conditional-voter-registration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">conditional voter registration</a>" option. This option is only available at county elections offices and select satellite locations depending on the rules of the county.</p>
