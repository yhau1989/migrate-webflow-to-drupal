<p>Candidates Ed Hernandez and Eleni Kounalakis are vying to become California’s next lieutenant governor. The “lite gov,” in the parlance, chairs the California State Lands Commission and the California Commission for Economic Development, sits on the University of California Board of Regents and California State University Board of Trustees and, most importantly, steps in if the governor cannot serve or leaves the state.</p>

<p>Kounalakis and Hernandez are both Democrats who disagree with tuition hikes and want to increase CAL Grant funding, but whose campaign funding differs dramatically. Take 7 minutes and 30 seconds—exactly—to learn more about the candidates.</p>
