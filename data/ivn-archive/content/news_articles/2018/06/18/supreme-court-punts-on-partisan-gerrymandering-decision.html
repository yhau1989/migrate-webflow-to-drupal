searchTitle: Supreme Court Punts on Partisan Gerrymandering Decision
-->
<p>The Supreme Court refused to weigh in on the issue of <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gerrymandering" rel="noopener noreferrer">partisan gerrymandering</a> in two cases out of Wisconsin (<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/wisconsin-redistricting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gill v. Whitford</em></a>) and Maryland (<em>Benisek v. Lamone</em>). The justices sent <em>Gill v. Whitford</em> back down to a lower court, while Maryland was dismissed unanimously.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Benisek v. Lamone</em>, the justices upheld a lower court's decision not to issue a preliminary injunction to block the 2011 congressional maps drawn by the Democratic-controlled state legislature. The high court is sticking with a decision it made it 2004 (<em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16656282825028631654&amp;q=Vieth+v.+Jubelirer&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_vis=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vieth v. Jubelirer</a></em>) that there is too much legal uncertainty on the issue, and there is no metric for the court to determine what constitutes "too partisan" when lawmakers draw maps.</p>

<p>In the Wisconsin case, the high court ruled that the Democratic voters who brought the lawsuit failed to prove they had been injured by State Assembly maps drawn by the Republican-controlled legislature. However, these voters will have another opportunity to make their case before lower courts.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more developments on this story.</p>
