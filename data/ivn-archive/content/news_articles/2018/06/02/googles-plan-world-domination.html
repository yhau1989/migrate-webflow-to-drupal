<p>Google's plan for world domination is fleshed out in public for the first time in an 8 1/2 minute video leaked from the tech giant in May.</p>

<p>This is not the Onion.</p>

<p>The video is a caricature of a low-budget dystopian sci-fi film that would be comical if the makers of the video didn't have a market capitalization larger than the budget for the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>

<p>It talks about a "species wide" capability for the proposed technology to promote behaviors that would "reflect Google's values as an organization."</p>

<p>The Verge, a subsidiary of Vox Media dedicated to examining how technology is changing culture, first broke the story.</p>
