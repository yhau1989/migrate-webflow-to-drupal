<p>IVN reported last week that a <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/30/purple-wave-independent-voters-swell-pass-republican-registration-in-ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">purple wave is sweeping over deep blue California</a>. Independents (registered No Party Preference in California) now outnumber Republicans by over 83,500 voters -- and the number is likely to continue to increase, looking at statewide trends.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/15day-stwddirprim-2018/congressional.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest report</a> from the California secretary of state shows an increase of 168,588 voters from <a href="http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/60day-stwddirprim-2018/congressional.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 6</a> to May 21. The increase was mostly registered independents, who dwarfed gains made by the Democratic and Republican Parties -- comprising approximately 70% (69.7%) of total new voters.</p>

<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Democrats: 32,804</li>
 	<li>Republican: 5,332</li>
 	<li>No Party Preference: 117,499</li>
 	<li>Other (third party / unknown): 12,953</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: It is difficult to tell what role California's <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/05/21/ca-voters-beware-serious-glitch-dmv-motor-voter-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new motor voter law</a> had on the numbers. The new automatic voter registration system went into effect in late April. I reached out to the California secretary of state's office, and will update the story with more information.</em></p>

<p>The increase in Republican registrants made up a mere 3 percent of the voter gains. In fact, interestingly enough, "Unknown" (included in "Other") outnumbered the GOP by over 3,300 voters.</p>

<p>What will this mean for the nonpartisan, top-two primaries Tuesday? So many new independent voters could have a major impact on statewide races.</p>
