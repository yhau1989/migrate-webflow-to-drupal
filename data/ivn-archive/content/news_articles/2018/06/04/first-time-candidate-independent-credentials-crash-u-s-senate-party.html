<p>James Bradley freely admits he is a newcomer and an outsider to politics. Hence his low name ID.</p>

<p>So why then is he polling third as a first-time candidate for U.S. Senate?</p>

<p>A University of California, Berkeley <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4x28272w" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> released Friday has Bradley&nbsp;right behind Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Kevin De&nbsp;León.</p>

<p>It would be a remarkable achievement for a political novice to finish the U.S. Senate race in the top-two. Perhaps it speaks to California voters' thirst for change.</p>
<h2><strong>The "Independent Republican"</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://jbradley2018.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley</a> is a Coast Guard veteran, has multiple MBA's and is the CFO of a health care startup.</p>

<p>He's a believer in climate change who vehemently opposes California's "sanctuary state" movement. Ironically, the man just ahead of him in the polls, De León, authored <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB 54</a>. Bradley, who referred to himself as a longtime independent, said he registered as a Republican for the first time in March, because he said, the Democratic Party was no longer a viable option.</p>

<p>In the Berkeley poll, the 60-year-old Laguna Niguel resident and first-time candidate fell one point behind state Sen.&nbsp;Kevin de León&nbsp;in the battle for second place and a spot on the November ballot.</p>
