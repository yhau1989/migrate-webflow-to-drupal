<p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> – If like most Americans you’re angry that our democracy feels broken, that elections are being corrupted by billionaire and corporate money, and that politicians are rigging elections through gerrymandering, we’ve got good news for you.</p>

<p>Grassroots America is staging a political comeback.</p>

<p>Citizen rebellions against the politicians and the power brokers are in full swing – from the student March for Our Lives to the spreading teacher strikes from Kentucky to Oklahoma and Arizona to the petition drives and popular votes on political reforms in states like Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Colorado.</p>

<p>For every flaw in our political system – dark money, voter suppression, gerrymandering,&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em>, Mega-Donors, hyper-partisanship – grassroots movements have come up with fixes and are already implementing reforms at the state level.</p>
