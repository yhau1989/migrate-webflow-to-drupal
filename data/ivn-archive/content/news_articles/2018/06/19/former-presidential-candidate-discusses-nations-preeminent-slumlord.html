<p>In the latest episode of "Deconstructed," IVN Principal Political Analyst TJ O'Hara talks with Dr. Lenora Fulani, the first African American independent and first female presidential candidate to qualify for the ballot in all 50 states. She is also an American psychologist, psychotherapist, and political activist.</p>

<p>Fulani is well-known for orchestrating programs that predominately serve minority interests in the New York City area, as well as having run for political office, including president, on several occasions. The two discuss her role as a political activist, including her role in addressing New York City's massive housing crisis, her experience as a candidate, and her views on our current political environment.</p>
