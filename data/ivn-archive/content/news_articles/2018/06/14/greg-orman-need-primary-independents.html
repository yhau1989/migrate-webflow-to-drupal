<p>Primary season is upon us again.&nbsp;With each passing Tuesday, the major parties across the country are selecting more combatants for November’s electoral battle.&nbsp;By mid-August, thousands of Republicans and Democrats will have&nbsp;been anointed&nbsp;to oppose the other team in the general election.</p>

<p>But despite the countless number of names on the ballot, it’s a process that excludes a large percentage of voters and is the principal driver of a system of government that no longer serves the American people. The broken primary system is allowing the greatness of America to slip away.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that government appears to represent the interests of two&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;unrepresentative political parties.&nbsp;But few political commentators spend time discussing why the parties have become so unrepresentative or how we can improve the system to be more accountable to the people.</p>

<p>During the primary, we pay the closest attention to the Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp;This is because the nominees of the major parties, in the eyes of the media, the voters, and&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;the political class, immediately become the most viable candidates in the general election.&nbsp;Independent and third party candidates&nbsp;are dismissed by political&nbsp;pundits as spoilers unless they have an&nbsp;ungodly&nbsp;amount of money or celebrity personality.</p>

<p>But, in America, our representative republic was always supposed to serve the people, not a class of people nor members of a political party.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Today,&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;half of the American electorate consider themselves independent of both political parties.</li>
 	<li>In many states, like my home state of Kansas, you cannot vote in a primary election unless you are a member of a major political party. These&nbsp;are knownas “closed” primaries and exist across 14 states.</li>
 	<li>In Kansas, more than 30% of voters have actually registered to vote as independents, thereby forfeiting their “right” to&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in a primary.</li>
 	<li>Primary election turnout is as low as 10% in many states.</li>
 	<li>In&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;90% of the congressional districts around the country, the districts have&nbsp;been rigged by&nbsp;the ruling party through gerrymandering so the general election is less a competition than a coronation of the ruling parties’ chosen candidate in the primary.</li>
 	<li>Primary elections are funded by taxpayers and administered by public officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, who are our representatives&nbsp;really&nbsp;accountable to? The people themselves, or a small partisan base of voters who ensure victory in the primary?</p>

<p>There’s no question that the primary election is an important stage of our public election process.&nbsp;And as the United States Supreme Court has recognized, we cannot have a representative republic unless every voter, regardless of where they live, what color they are, or which party affiliation they have has an&nbsp;equallymeaningful vote at every stage of the election process.</p>

<p>In states like Kansas,&nbsp;however, where nearly 1/3 of the electorate registers as independent, voters who feel unrepresented by either major political party&nbsp;are forced&nbsp;to join one - otherwise, they cannot&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in the primary election.&nbsp;Given how the parties have behaved over the past couple of decades, can you&nbsp;really&nbsp;blame any American who doesn’t want to associate with either one of them?</p>

<p>As long as our election process affords the two major parties and their members exclusive access to the primaries, they will continue to have a state-sanctioned, taxpayer-funded, and anti-competitive monopoly over our most sacred right — the right to vote.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not suggesting we get rid of political parties or their primaries.&nbsp;What I am suggesting, to my Republican friends especially, is to consider the value of increased electoral competition&nbsp;just&nbsp;like you champion competition in the business world.</p>

<p>What I’m suggesting to my Democratic friends is a democracy that gives everyone the same rights as you and your membership without having to join your party.</p>

<p>What I’m suggesting is simple, legal, and ripe for Kansans, and&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;all ofAmerica.</p>

<p>In short, let’s put a public nomination process on the primary ballot — an independent primary — for any voter or candidate who doesn’t want to register as or&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in either of the major party’s primaries. Let’s invite the Libertarian, Green, and all other minor parties to&nbsp;participate.</p>

<p>It would give the 44 percent of Americans who now identify as independents an equal right to vote.&nbsp;It would give independent candidates more exposure to the media, which would rather cover the horse race aspects of an election than the merits of the respective candidates.&nbsp;It would help create a real third force in our politics, thereby creating the competition and accountability that our system of government so&nbsp;desperately&nbsp;needs.</p>

<p>And it would create an incentive for any candidate who wants to&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in that independent primary to speak to voters from across the political spectrum and bring them together.</p>
