<p>Maine voters may be surprised when they see a new ad in favor of protecting Maine ranked choice voting that features A-list actress and Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lawrence has branched out from Hollywood to the political and election reform space. She is a board member of <a href="http://represent.us" rel="noopener noreferrer">Represent.us</a>, a national, nonpartisan anti-corruption organization, she headlined the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/unrig-the-system" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unrig the System Summit</a> in New Orleans in February, and now she is speaking out in favor of ranked choice voting in Maine.</p>

<p>Maine voters not only have a historic opportunity to take part in the first elections for state, US House, and US Senate to use ranked choice voting on June 12, but they will also vote on preserving the election reform initially approved by voters in 2016.</p>

<p>State politicians have pulled out all the stops to try to overturn ranked choice voting, but the people continue to fight back.</p>
