<p>There was no contest for the top spot in the US Senate race in California. Incumbent Senator Dianne Feinstein took <a href="https://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/us-senate" rel="noopener noreferrer">43.8% of the vote</a> in the nonpartisan, top-two open primary. That was in a field of 32 candidates.</p>

<p>The most interesting race was for the second spot in the November election. It was a tight contest between California State Senator Kevin de Le贸n, a Democrat, and <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/06/04/first-time-candidate-independent-credentials-crash-u-s-senate-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">first-time candidate James Bradley</a>, a Republican.</p>

<p>De Le贸n edged out Bradley, taking 11.3% to Bradley's 8.8%.</p>

<p>The interesting thing to note is that de Le贸n <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_de_Le%C3%B3n" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a former President pro tempore</a> of the California State Senate. He served in this role from October 2014 to March 21, 2018.&nbsp; He has been a member of the State Senate since 2010 and served in the State Assembly before that.</p>

<p>Kevin de Le贸n has established name recognition in California politics. Bradley is a Coast Guard veteran, has multiple MBAs, and is the Chief Financial Officer of a health care startup. He has never held public office nor had he attempted to run for office before the 2018 Senate race.</p>

<p>Forget talks of "blue waves" or "red waves," there appears to be a hunger among many voters for political outsiders in particular.</p>

<p>Bradley may not have made it in the top-two, but the desire for someone outside the political establishment was also seen in the governor's race, where Republican John Cox made the top two with 26.2% of the vote -- beating out politicians like Democrat&nbsp;Antonio Villaraigosa and Republican Travis Allen.</p>

<p>Cox, unlike Bradley, has run for public office -- just not in California. He has never held public office though.</p>

<p>The popularity of outsider candidates -- either candidates who are new to the political arena (like Bradley) or candidates who defy the two-party political establishments (like we saw with Sanders and Trump in 2016) appears to be growing and could have an impact come November.</p>
