searchTitle: Arizona GOP Tries to Rob Libertarian Kevin McCormick Out of Ballot Spot
-->
<p><strong>ARIZONA</strong> - Republicans in Arizona are trying to rob Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Kevin McCormick of a spot on the ballot. This is in spite of the fact that he has submitted the second-most signatures of any candidate to meet qualifications for the November ballot.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lines, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party, has filed a lawsuit claiming that over 90 percent of the signatures McCormick collected are illegitimate -- meaning they are not real Arizona voters.</p>

<p>The deck is already stacked against third party candidates like McCormick, who had to collect 3,152 valid signatures to qualify for the ballot -- a number the Republican-controlled legislature increased from 133. To be safe, third party and independent candidates generally have to get double the amount of signatures in the event some are tossed as invalid.</p>

<p>But the legitimacy of the lawsuit is not necessarily the point. Challenging third party and independent signatures is a common tactic used by the Republican and Democratic Parties. It hangs a costly legal challenge that would starve these candidates financially -- forcing them to drop out before the courts can even weigh in.</p>

<p>Think of it as a financial battle of attrition that the major parties know they will win. Meanwhile, alternative candidates and voices get shut out of the process completely.</p>

<p>McCormick's big fight won't be to prove his signatures are valid. It will be surviving (financially speaking) to November.</p>
