searchTitle: Independents Boost Historic Primary Turnout in Colorado
-->
<p>Colorado voters went to the polls Tuesday for the 2018 midterm primary elections. It was the first major primary season independents were allowed to participate in without re-registering with one of the major parties since Proposition 108 passed in 2016.</p>

<p>Midterm primaries historically don't have as high of turnout as presidential primaries, but Colorado saw historic participation in 2018.</p>

<p>With 98.4% of precincts reporting,&nbsp;1,142,008 ballots have been counted statewide. That is nearly 35% of active registered voters (as of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VoterRegNumbers/2018/May/VotersByPartyStatus.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">last report</a> released by the secretary of state). This is the highest voter turnout in a recent Colorado primary.&nbsp; The 2010 primary turnout previously held this distinction with 32.36% turnout.</p>

<p>And since independents do not need to re-register with a party to vote, we have hard numbers that shows how much of an impact they had in the election. Though still being forced to choose between a Republican or Democratic ballot, approximately a <a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2018/06/27/colorado-larimer-2018-primary-election-turnout-hits-historic-high/737080002/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarter of primary electorate</a> were unaffiliated voters.</p>

<p>These voters pushed a historic primary turnout even higher. Though members of the press seem intent on downplaying the impact these voters had in key races, and the point of open primary reform.</p>

<p>Proposition 108 opened existing primary elections to independent voters. Proposition 107 replaced the state's caucus system with open presidential primaries. <a href="https://ivn.us/2017/07/31/open-primaries-chosen-by-voters-attacked-by-lawmakers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Both were approved by voters in 2016</a>.</p>
