<p>Health care is running front and center in the three Iowa races.</p>

<p>Iowa went Trump in 2016, which saw the Democrats blown out of the water that year. Iowa Democrats are seeking to un-fracture their party which saw supporters defect from establishment candidate Hillary to outsider Progressive Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary caucuses.&nbsp;In fact, in 2016, Republicans stole the state Senate, making the state a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_government_trifectas" rel="noopener noreferrer">trifecta</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>of GOP control beginning in the 2017 legislative session.</p>
<h2>Governor</h2>
<p>Incumbent Gov. Kim Reynolds is alone representing the Republicans. Two Democrats are facing off, and its business versus labor. Fred Hubbell, a business owner is up against Cathy Glasson, a labor leader. The third, state legislator Nate Boulton quit&nbsp;mid-race after a sexual misconduct scandal. These three candidates have widely divergent philosophies on health care, explained here, by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/4/17406174/midterm-2018-primary-june-5-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vox</a><b>.</b></p>

<p><em>"Expect health care and Trump’s approval rating to come into play in this race. Reynolds’s signature achievement is probably moving Iowa’s 600,000 Medicaid enrollees into managed care, a privatized version of the program where private health plans administer Medicaid’s benefits. Hubbell wants to reverse that privatization, while Glasson supports a more liberal single-payer option."</em></p>
<h2>Iowa’s third US Congressional District: Again, more healthcare.</h2>
<p>Republicans are listing their incumbent, Rep. David Young, who <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/House/David_Young_Health_Care.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> to repeal Obama Care. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Democrats are running three candidates: former Bernie Sanders campaign aide Pete D’Alessandro, former insurance executive Eddie Mauro, and Cindy Axne, a former small-business owner. This race is all about progressive visions of healthcare and moderate. Check out their <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/29/iowa-elections-democratic-candidates-3rd-congressional-district-axne-dalessandro-mauro/651635002/" rel="noopener noreferrer">platforms</a> from the Des Moines Register.</p>
<h2><strong>Iowa’s first US Congressional District</strong></h2>
<p>In the eastern part of the state,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>it’s a four-way race for the Democratic spot in the November general elections.&nbsp; Republican Rep. Rod Blum is the incumbent Republican incumbent.&nbsp; &nbsp;State legislator Abby Finkenauer, is leading the way as, potentially, the youngest women elected to Congress in US history. This race makes Blum vulnerable to the Democrats.</p>
<h2>Battle Ground Primary</h2>
