<p>US Rep. <strong>Trey Gowdy</strong> (R-SC) announced his retirement from Congress Wednesday, making him yet <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/31/republicans-who-wont-be-coming-back-to-congress-after-2018-midterm-elections.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">another Republican lawmaker</a> who will not seek re-election in the 2018 midterms. Gowdy is returning home to practice law, and is reportedly leaving because he isn't happy with the divisive political environment in Washington.</p>

<p>“Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” said Gowdy. “As I look back on my career, it is the jobs that both seek and reward fairness that are most rewarding.”</p>

<p>Interesting to note: Many politicians retiring in 2018 in one way or another have alluded to the current state of politics in DC, yet they are also among the most partisan themselves. Gowdy, for instance, oversaw the politically divisive House investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack, and votes with his party <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/trey-gowdy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly 100%</a> of the time, while enacting few bills that can garner bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Apparently the DC swamp is starting to get too polluted even for its own inhabitants.</p>
