searchTitle: "The Battle for New York: Larry Sharpe Steps to Andrew Cuomo"
-->
<p>In the New York governor’s race, Larry Sharpe is ahead of the Republicans in fundraising.</p>



<p>He says he’s shaping the 3.0 version of the Libertarian Party and that it’s totally possible to take Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo's job in the 2018 election. He’s also kicked off fundraising with crypto on the WAVES blockchain. The name? “Sharpecoin.” Enjoy.</p>
