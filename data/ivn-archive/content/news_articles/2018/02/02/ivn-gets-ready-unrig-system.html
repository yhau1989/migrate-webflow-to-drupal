searchTitle: IVN Gets Ready to Unrig the System
-->
<p>An unprecedented gathering of the brightest minds from the right and left with one common purpose: fix American politics. Leaders in advocacy, policy, politics, legal, movement-building, and popular culture share their knowledge and experience to build lasting solutions that inspire change.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://unrigsummit.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unrig the System Summit</a> will be fast-paced and fun, with time to mingle with top advocacy leaders, academics, comedians, musicians, celebrities, activists, philanthropists and journalists, as well as plenty of New Orleans fun mixed in.</p>

<p>This summit will be like no other, and IVN is excited to say we'll be in attendance to cover the event!</p>

<p>There will be discussions and panels across partisan and ideological divides focused on working together to unrig America's political system.</p>
