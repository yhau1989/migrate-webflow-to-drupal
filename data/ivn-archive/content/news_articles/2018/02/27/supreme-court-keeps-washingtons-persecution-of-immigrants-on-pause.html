<p>SO yesterday the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/26/supreme-court-snubs-trump-keeps-daca-immigration-program-place-now/371730002/" rel="noopener noreferrer">declined to review</a> a decision by a federal appeals court in California to order the White House to continue the DACA policy. </p>

<p>It's a moment of relief for the 690,000 people who moved to America when they were kids, and grew up here, yet like many immigrants in America– face relentless harassment, threats, and intimidation from the U.S. federal government.</p>

<p>But it may be a short-lived moment. </p>

<p>The fight between the White House and federal judges over DACA is still running its course through the appeals system and may end up before the Supreme Court again.</p>

<p>DACA, which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a federal policy</a> that began in 2012 by an executive action of the White House instead of by congressional legislation.</p>

<p>The policy is to give some immigrants who moved to America when they were minors a renewable 2-year deferment on the possibility of being seized by federal police like a criminal even if they've never hurt anyone, and taken from their home, and shipped off to another country like slaves or something. </p>

<p>Yeah the policy is a deferment on that. How liberal of all of us in 2018. Very forward thinking people here in this government.</p>

<p>btw– DACA <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/369487-poll-nearly-nine-in-10-favor-allowing-daca-recipients-to-stay" rel="noopener noreferrer">is supported by 9 out of 10 Americans</a> (and 8 out of 10 Republicans) according to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-support-daca-but-oppose-border-wall-cbs-news-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a CBS News poll</a> last month conducted by telephone with a random sample of 1,225 adults nationwide.</p>

<p>But I wouldn't call DACA an executive action.</p>

<p>It's more like an executive inaction.</p>

<p>An action would be the act of forcing your way into innocent people's homes– or accosting them where they work– with armed police, to kidnap them from their homes or workplace, treat them just as we do the worst, most violent criminals in our society, and then ship them off to a remote country.</p>

<p><em>Not</em> doing all of that is an executive <em>in</em>action– an executive decision not to take a very drastic and hurtful action on a massive scale that needlessly and severely disrupts the lives of so many individuals, and families, and businesses. So don't let anyone tell you that DACA was executive overreach on the part of the Obama Administration. <a href="http://www.humblelibertarian.com/2017/11/100-ways-donald-trump-is-just-like-barack-obama.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not even Jeff Sessions</a>. It was executive pull back.</p>

<p>But before the liberals reading start high-fiving each other–&nbsp;don't give Obama too much credit either. While he pulled back on childhood arrivals he was full throttle forward with Washington's persecution of immigrants overall: He deported more people than any president in U.S. history. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-deportation-policy-numbers/story?id=41715661" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yeah, seriously</a>.</p>

<p>It's heart-breakingly reminiscent of the Gulag under Soviet Russia, in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak" rel="noopener noreferrer">people in a certain strata of society were scapegoated</a> for any financial difficulties faced by any number of other people, and were systematically persecuted by the U.S.S.R., which just like the U.S.A. right now in 2018, the land of the free and the home of the brave, rounded them up by the millions and shipped them off to Siberia.</p>

<p>Now to be fair, the Soviet Gulag <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag" rel="noopener noreferrer">was run with far more brutality</a> than I.C.E. and that behemoth monstrosity, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but what the U.S. is doing to immigrants right now is still almost unbelievably cruel and inhuman, especially at this point in our history. There's nothing conservative about it. There's nothing liberal about it. It's just awful. </p>

<p>To think we have the blight of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Crow laws</a> behind us and almost everyone today would agree they were racist and cruel, even people who support mass deportations of peaceful immigrants, and yet there are still people who support mass deportations of peaceful immigrants! And our incredibly corrupt and totally unscrupulous government is very aggressively persecuting millions of people because they were born on the wrong side of an imaginary line.</p>

<p>(It's surreal just how cruel <em>and absurd</em> it is.) </p>

<p>Okay someone press the <a href="https://ivn.us/tag/independent-thought-alarm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Thought Alarm</a> and have me hauled out of here by security. I've said enough today.</p>
