<p>Sierra Club San Diego has announced its endorsement of the SDSU West initiative.</p>

The Sierra Club’s endorsement honors SDSU West’s commitment to comply with the highest possible environmental standards, create a public and transparent planning process and ensure that the existing stadium site benefits all San Diegans.
