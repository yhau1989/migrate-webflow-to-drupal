<p>Another major independent campaign officially announced its launch Thursday. Craig O'Dear, a prominent attorney in Missouri, has officially entered the race for US Senate.</p>

<p>"On this tough day for our nation, I am more resolved than ever to chart a new way forward," O'Dear said on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/odearformissouri/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Page</a>.</p>

<p>O'Dear's campaign is founded on a number of core principles, including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The need to put country before party;</li>
 	<li>Finding common ground to solve problems;</li>
 	<li>Standing for opportunity, equality, and stewardship;</li>
 	<li>Championing competition, transparency, and accountability in politics; and</li>
 	<li>Encouraging increased citizen participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Our country is at a historically difficult moment," <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/independent-candidate-o-dear-formally-enters-missouri-s-hyper-partisan/article_5078662d-5ee8-57b2-aad5-7e0822e9cbf1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">says O'Dear</a>.&nbsp;“The hyper-partisan warfare of [the Republican and Democratic] parties is a major part of the problem.”</p>

<p>O'Dear joins a growing list of independent candidates running for state office, including <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/greg-orman" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Greg Orman</strong></a>, candidate for Kansas governor, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/terry-hayes" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Terry Hayes</strong></a>, the first independent state treasurer in Maine and a clean elections candidate for governor, <a href="https://ivn.us/2018/02/08/were-doing-it-the-independent-revolution-is-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Neal Simon</strong></a>, candidate for U.S. Senate in Maryland, and incumbent Alaska Governor <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bill-walker" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bill Walker</strong></a> -- the only sitting independent governor in the nation.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more coverage of these candidates and more.</p>
