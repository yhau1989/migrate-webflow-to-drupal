<p>Deep Blue California sent a strong signal to longtime Senator Dianne Feinstein that she just isn't Blue enough.</p>

<p>In a vote at the San Diego Convention Center on Saturday, the California Democratic Party voted not to endorse the 84-year-old Feinstein, instead giving many of their votes to State Senator Kevin De Leon, considered a more progressive Democrat.</p>

<p>De Leon got 54 percent of the vote, compared to 37 percent for Feinstein. Neither Democrat will receive the state party endorsement because they failed to reach the 60 percent threshold.</p>

<p>DeLeon quickly pounced issuing a statement, “The outcome of today’s endorsement vote is an astounding rejection of politics as usual, and it boosts our campaign’s momentum as we all stand shoulder-to-shoulder against a complacent status quo."</p>

<p><strong>TRUMP PLAYING A FACTOR</strong></p>

<p>It seems clear that any weakness shown towards the president means political suicide for any Democrat, particularly in arguably the most liberal state in the country.</p>

<p>Feinstein has taken heat for admitting no "collusion exists between President Trump and the Russians."</p>

<p>She also has been crushed by Democrats after voicing optimism about Trump becoming "a good president.”</p>

<p>Feinstein also recently said that former President Barack Obama’s DACA program was on shaky legal ground.</p>

<p><strong>THE INDEPENDENT FACTOR</strong></p>

<p>Feinstein will be difficult to beat however, considering her establishment support and standing among independents and women, two key voting blocs.</p>

<p>Ben Tulchin, a San Francisco pollster has recently <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/25/california-democratic-party-doesnt-endorse-feinstein-re-election-bid.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>, “It will be tough to outflank her in that capacity,"</p>

<p>If she wins, Feinstein would be 91 at the end of her six year term.</p>
