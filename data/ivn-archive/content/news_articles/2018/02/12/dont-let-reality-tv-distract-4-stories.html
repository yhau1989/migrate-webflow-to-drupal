 	<li>Omarosa’s back to reality tv! On a recent episode of “Celebrity Big Brother,” Omarosa confided in a castmate about her time spent at the White House. While her comments shed some light on the relationship among staff members in the White House and with how people feel about the Trump Administration, they won’t matter much in the long run.</li>

 	<li>Annnnnd it’s back again. Headlines with the words “sexual misconduct” graced our media outlets once more last week.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/06/casino-tycoon-steve-wynn-resigns-citing-avalance-bad-publicity-amid-sex-misconduct-claims/313901002/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of Wynn Resorts</strong></a>&nbsp;in an effort to save the brand from his wrongdoings.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/5140897/california-metoo-assemblywoman-misconduct-allegation/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>in California,&nbsp;Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia was accused of sexual misconduct at a softball game</strong></a>&nbsp;a few years back.&nbsp;<a href="https://freewheelus.com/no-more-excuses/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>It’s time we admit we have a problem with sexual misconduct in America.&nbsp;</strong></a></li>
 	<li>Coming along with the sexual misconduct deja vu was&nbsp;<a href="https://freewheelus.com/looming-government-shutdown-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>government shutdown deja&nbsp;vu</strong></a>. The government shut down once more. However, it lasted only 8 hours as the Senate was able to create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-shutdown/trump-signs-deal-to-end-brief-agency-shutdown-boost-u-s-spending-idUSKBN1FS232" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>legislation funding the government for two more years</strong></a>. After some obstacles in the House, the bill made it to President Trump’s desk where he promptly signed it. The bill is a positive in that it’s a relatively long-term solution. However, it’s quite strange to see such deficit increases from the supposedly fiscally conservative Republican government.</li>
 	<li>On a higher note,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/06/583627592/watch-live-spacex-attempts-launch-of-powerful-falcon-heavy-rocket?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20180206" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SpaceX launched their Falcon Heavy rocket, the most powerful rocket in decades, into space</strong></a>. The rocket is headed for Mars and carries along with it some data stored on an “arch” (pronounced “ark”), a Tesla Roadster, a mannequin, and a hot wheels car.</li>
 	<li>And last, but definitely not least, the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/winter-olympics/winter-olympics-2018-opening-ceremony-yuna-kim-lights-the-torch/ar-BBITVlc?li=BBmkt5R&amp;ocid=spartanntp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winter Olympics began in PyeongChang</a></strong>&nbsp;last week.
