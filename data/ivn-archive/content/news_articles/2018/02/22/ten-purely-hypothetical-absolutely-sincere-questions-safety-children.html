<p><strong>(1)</strong> If hundreds of children every year were killed by falling out of windows, could we all agree that wanting to make windows safer had nothing to do with being anti-window or wanting to take people’s windows away?</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> If the greatest threat to children’s safety in school were the possibility of&nbsp; angry rhinoceroses stampeding through the hallways, would we think to solve the problem by stationing an angry rhinoceros in every classroom?</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> If 30,000 people a year were killed by snake bites, would it make sense to forbid public health organizations from studying snakes as a public health issue?</p>

<p><strong>(4)</strong> If we knew that normal laundry detergent could be turned into a hand grenade by the addition of chemical called “killdust,” whose only known purpose was to turn detergent into hand grenades, would we make it illegal to manufacture and sell killdust?</p>

<p><strong>(5)</strong> Would the Constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom give a Church the right to require young children to handle dangerous snakes to prove their worthiness to be baptized?</p>

<p><strong>(6)</strong> If a country with more pomegranates than all other countries in the world combined also had an exponentially higher rate of death by choking on pomegranate seeds, would we see a connection?</p>

<p><strong>(7)</strong> If somebody stole a tank from a National Guard unit and leveled their high school with tank-gun fire, would we say that anyone who wants to level their high school will find a way to do it, so there is really no point in locking up tanks?</p>

<p><strong>(8)</strong> If thousands of people a year were killed by forklift drivers who didn’t know how to operate a forklift would we institute regulation requiring training and licensing to drive a forklift?</p>

<p><strong>(9)</strong> If we regularly experienced mass murders by people who bought large amounts of play-dough and dumped it on schools, smothering everybody inside, would it make sense to limit play-dough purchases and track anyone who bought large amounts?</p>

<p><strong>(10)</strong> If children who had survived a smallpox epidemic in their town came forward to argue for smallpox vaccinations, would politicians and journalists criticize them as “paid actors,” “naïve children,” or“pawns of the vaccination movement”?</p>
