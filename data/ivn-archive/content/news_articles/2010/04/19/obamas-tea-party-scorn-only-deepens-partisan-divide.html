If the "other side" refuses to treat him with respect, so what!&nbsp; He'll just have to be the bigger man. That's what he said he'd do.&nbsp; He promised that he was going to be different.</p><p>Otherwise, he's on the same path as the infamous George W. Bush, who once promised the nation that he was going to be a "uniter, not a divider".&nbsp;</p><p>Look where that empty promise left us.</p>
