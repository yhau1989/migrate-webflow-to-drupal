Now, Palin has become a vocal critic of Obama's big spending ways.</p><p>On foreign policy, Palin is a staunch supporter of the current War on Terror, while Paul is a strident critic of current war policy and the record military budget.</p><p>On social issues, Palin is a staunch cultural conservative, while Paul, though personally conservative, believes state governments, and not the Federal government, should determine their own policies when it comes to drugs, marriage, and abortion.</p><p>Ironically, though, in many ways, supporters of both Palin and Paul possess a number of similar core similarities, as evidenced by the poll.&nbsp; They are extremely concerned about the size of the budget deficit, the explosive national debt, and the rapid expansion of the Federal government.</p><p>In the coming months, expect the competition to intensify between the Palin and Paul camps.&nbsp; As I wrote in my previous article <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/04/14/ron-paul-shocks-political-establishment-again" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Paul shocks the political establishment again</a>, a CNN poll revealed that Republicans are more keen on Palin, but Paul is far more competitive with Obama as the recent Rasmussen poll showed.</p><p>For now, the (post-Obama) Tea Party movement gives the edge to Palin, but voters across the political spectrum, especially Independents, give the clear advantage to Dr. Paul.</p><p>This will be an exciting contest to follow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*&nbsp; Editor's note:&nbsp; author added statement for purpose of clarification</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
