<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tea-party-for-gut1.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://tea-party-for-gut1.jpg" width="300"></a></p><p>Huffington Post contributor, Ellis Weiner, recently issued forth a partisan-fueled diatribe called "Tea Party Animals", in which he bashes George W. Bush and Tea Party intellect.&nbsp; While there are some kernels of thought-provoking analysis, the rant serves as yet another example of rage-filled, inconsistent partisan rhetoric that further polarizes an already deeply polarized nation.</p><p>In his <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellis-weiner/tea-party-animals_b_551213.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, Weiner mocks the Tea Party as largely devoid of political and intellectual substance, claiming that is more of a display of confusion, anger, and breath-taking ignorance after the collapse of the Bush era.&nbsp; He cites inflammatory slogans, anti-Obama rhetoric, and "silly costumes" as clear-cut evidence of its folly.&nbsp; He also insults George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and Fox News along the way.</p><p>To be fair, the substance of several of his criticisms may be valid.&nbsp; For example, the Tea Party possesses a strong strain of anti-Obama, anti-Democrat rancor.&nbsp; Except for the Ron Paul segment, which originated the pre-Obama Tea Party movement and called out the GOP before Bush left office, much of the Tea Party rhetoric is seemingly partisan-based. The post-Obama Tea Party movement was nowhere to be found as Bush &amp; Republican members of Congress ran huge deficits, exploded the national debt, and initiated the Wall St bailouts. &nbsp;</p><p>However, it should also be noted that according to one reputable, right-leaning <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/04/05/surveys-show-41-tea-party-supporters-are-democrats-and-independents" rel="noopener noreferrer">polling firm</a>, as many as 13% of Democrats, and 28% of Independents support the Tea Party movement.&nbsp; In addition, the Tea Party has even <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/15/walt-minnick-tea-party-en_n_538837.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially endorsed</a> its first Democratic candidate.&nbsp; In defense of the Tea Party, it may be expanding across the political spectrum more than Weiner is willing to concede.</p><p>Weiner excoriates George W. Bush and Sarah Palin, and despite his vitriolic language, here too, there is some degree of truth behind the offensive language.&nbsp; After all, Bush and a largely Republican Congress did borrow and spend America into oblivion.&nbsp; They did implement some highly controversial national security policies which to some, seemed to be a blatant violation of several, sacred Constitutional principles.&nbsp; A PTSD epidemic and record suicide rate in the military did explode onto the scene with multiple, open-ended wars.</p><p>And Palin, despite her current embrace of fiscal conservatism, defended the Wall St bailout and the budget busting policies of John McCain while on the campaign trail in 2008.</p><p>So yes, there are valid reasons to question the consistency and intentions of the post-Obama tea party movement and Sarah Palin's rise to tea party stardom.&nbsp; These concerns deserve a fair hearing and objective critique.</p><p>But, on the other side of the coin, Weiner appears to be blinded by his own partisan bias.&nbsp; For example, when referring to the Bush era, he characterizes it as:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the one of unjustified war, rampant lies, secret torture, domestic spying, tax cuts for the rich, government-by-crony, and utter economic stagnation for the middle class?</p><p>A more objective observer would likely ask, "How are Obama and the Democratic Congress really any different?"&nbsp; Obama has skyrocketed the number of Drone attacks, attacks that have killed hundreds of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&nbsp; These attacks are largely executed by the CIA, without any oversight at all.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, under Obama's leadership, there are over 200,000 private war contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, portions of which are not subject to any oversight by the US military.&nbsp; The US is now conducting increasing operations in Pakistan and Yemen, without any Declaration of War or Letters of Marque &amp; Reprisal as the Constitution mandates.</p><p>Guantanamo Bay is still open, and Afghanistan's "Guantanamo Bay" in <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/04/06/afghanistans-new-guantanamo-bay-raises-serious-ethical-questions-about-us-war-eff" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bagram</a> is expanding in its detainment role.&nbsp; Obama supports prolonged detention of "suspected terrorists", and he &amp; Congress just <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/28/president-obama-signs-patriot-act-extension" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended</a> three provisions of the Patriot Act.&nbsp;</p><p>Obama hasn't endorsed tax cuts for the rich, but almost 50% of Americans didn't have to pay the federal income tax this year, a tax rebate extravaganza that has not been balanced by any spending cuts (just like the Bush administration) and is poised to push the budget deficit to a mind-bending $1.6 trillion this year.</p><p>And "government-by-crony"?&nbsp; One look at Obama's cabinet and advisory circle, and one sees the usual ties to the Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs, and other fat-cat lobbyists.&nbsp;</p><p>And what about "economic stagnation for the middle class"?&nbsp; Under Obama, middle class incomes have remained virtually stagant and real unemployment is well above 10%, as Wall St has enjoyed an explosive rally off its record lows in March 2009.</p><p>Now, to be fair, Weiner implies that a few of these policies haven't changed since Bush, but he fails to apply the same, rigorous critiques of the Bush administration to the Obama administration and Democratic-led Congress.</p><p>His ridicule of Limbaugh, Beck, and Fox News also carries some merit, but it also fails to address a similar phenomenon in the liberal media as well.&nbsp; Yes, Limbaugh, Beck, and Fox News can fuel anti-Obama and anti-Democrat rage amongst conservatives, but Olbermann, Matthews, Maddow, and other liberal icons play the same exact game.&nbsp; Both sides of the media thrive on the partisan division, while neglecting the hypocrisy and culpability of their own politicians.</p><p>While insulting the Tea Party, Weiner also fails to identify that <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/04/19/sarah-palin-edges-out-ron-paul-tea-party-poll" rel="noopener noreferrer">two major camps</a> within the movement have emerged:&nbsp; the Palin and Paul factions.&nbsp; He exorciates Palin but fails to tackle the Ron Paul faction, a faction that has long been consistent in its criticism of both the Obama and Bush administrations.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Palin, Paul appears to be <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/04/14/ron-paul-shocks-political-establishment-again" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaining support</a> from Democrats, Independents, and Republicans on a slate of different issues, ranging from a more non-interventionist foreign policy, to balanced budgets, states' rights, protecting civil liberties, and auditing the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Finally, Weiner, apparently blinded by his own partisanship, may be vastly underestimating the potential of the Tea Party movement, strictly from a politically pragmatic perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Tea Party, or certain segments of it, the polls continue to reveal that it is a force to be reckoned with, and Weiner &amp; left-leaning ideologues will only embolden the right-leaning movement with their constant barrage of political invective.</p>
