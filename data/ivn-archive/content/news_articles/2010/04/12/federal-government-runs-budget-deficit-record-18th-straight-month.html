<p>Imagine if, in your personal life, you ran a budget deficit for 18 consecutive months.&nbsp; Or, imagine if you owned a business, and you ran a budget deficit for 18 straight months.&nbsp;</p><p>In either scenario, you wouldn't survive.&nbsp; Your family would suffer, your employees would suffer, and you'd be caught in the grip of punishing financial hardship.&nbsp;</p><p>For the last 10 years, America has not produced a balanced budget.&nbsp; Bush and a Republican Congress couldn't balance it, Bush and a Democratic Congress couldn't balance it, and so far, Obama and a Democratic Congress aren't even close.&nbsp; In fact, the nonpartisan CBO projects budget deficits for the next <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/26/cbos-2020-vision-debt-will-rise-to-90-of-gdp/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten years</a>.</p><p>It doesn't take a financial genius to comprehend that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aLtzzcecJCIE&amp;pos=3" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 consecutive months of budget deficits</a> (and counting) is an unsustainable path, a path toward certain financial destruction.&nbsp; It is a path toward higher interest rates, higher consumer prices, mediocre economic growth, and a lower standard of living for all Americans.&nbsp; It may even be a path toward a catastrophic Dollar collapse <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZA0qNsf4m0&amp;feature=pyv&amp;ad=3723781624&amp;kw=dollar" rel="noopener noreferrer">as some experts are warning</a>.</p><p>Unless this course is reversed, America will drown in a sea of debt.&nbsp; It's not a matter of if, but when.&nbsp; It's just good, old-fashioned common sense.&nbsp; No PhDs or Wall St. gurus are required to put 2 and 2 together on this one.</p><p>But, with the emergence of the Tea Party, Coffee Party, Liberty movement, and <a href="http://caivn.org/declaration-independents" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent movement</a>, perhaps 2010 and 2012 will right the ship and save our nation from financial calamity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
