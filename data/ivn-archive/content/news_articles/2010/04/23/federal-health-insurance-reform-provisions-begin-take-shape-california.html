Taking effect by the end of 2010, including extending coverage for dependents until age 26, it will eliminate lifetime limits on benefits and prohibit denying children coverage due to pre-existing conditions.</p><p><br><br>And in Washington, the IRS sent more than 500,000 small business and tax-exempt groups in California a notice that they may quality for tax credits on their employees’ health insurance premiums.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the small businesses that qualify would be <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2010/04/20/2690429/small-businesses-qualify-for-health.html#ixzz0ltpQK1w5" rel="noopener noreferrer">eligible</a> for a federal tax credit up to 35 percent of health insurance premiums paid beginning in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>After a year-long debate full of poisonous partisan vitriole, health insurance reform appears to be getting off to a good start.</p>
