Only in L.A.”</p><p><br>Droughts, water shortages, and contentious town and country battles over who gets the precious liquid have been part of the California ethos for decades, and are likely to continue unabated long into the future.&nbsp; So is the tension between the state’s more liberal cities (Los Angeles and San Francisco) and its more conservative agricultural communities (particularly the San Joaquin Valley).&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Department of Water Resources (DWR) recently increased its state water project allocation from 15 to 20 percent – still well below the finally 40 percent for last year.&nbsp; That number could eventually equal the 2009 total, but is unlikely to go higher.</p><p><br>"We've had a hit and miss nature to storms this winter, and that has left the State Water Project in not as good a position as we would like to be and perhaps worse than you would expect based upon those fairly good numbers regarding snowpack and precipitation," said DWR Director Mark Cowin at a press conference at the end of March. "Remember that we started this winter with very poor carry over storage in most of our key reservoirs."</p><p><br>In a state known for its bounty, shortages have become the coin of the realm.&nbsp; But it remains almost unfathomable that the Sierra ski slopes are still skiable this late in the season while California contemplates another summer of restricted water supplies.</p>
