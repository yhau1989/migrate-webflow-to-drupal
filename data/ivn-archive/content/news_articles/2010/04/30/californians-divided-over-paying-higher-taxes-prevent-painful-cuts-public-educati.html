Another 38 percent say their schools have been affected somewhat, and only 17 percent say they have seen no effect.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 63 percent want to protect K–12 education from spending cuts.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly all Californians believe that the position on education among candidates who are running for governor is important, yet when broken down by party, 72 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of independents believe candidates' positions on education are important as compared to only 46 percent of Republicans.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blacks (68 percent) and whites (60 percent) today are far more likely than Asians (48 percent) and Latinos (41 percent) to see education quality as a big problem.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 49 percent support paying higher taxes to maintain current funding and 47 percent do not.</p><p><br><br>With state education dollars more than 60 percent of the state’s budget, this poll reflects two issues that will make tackling the state’s budget crisis and education funding nearly impossible.&nbsp;</p><p>First, until people perceive that the crisis affects them personally, there is little concern for the impact it is having on the rest of the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, despite recognition of the crisis, nearly half of Californians are unwilling to pay higher taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>Until the state can raise sufficient resources, we will likely see these numbers spike long before there is any real reform.</p>
