According to the Center for Immigration Studies, SB 1070 <a href="http://cis.org/Announcement/AZ-Immigration-SB1070" rel="noopener noreferrer">allows</a> law enforcement to only ask about one’s immigration status during instances like a traffic stop or the committing of a crime.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>The justification for the Los Angeles order is to not discourage illegals from coming forward and reporting crimes.&nbsp; "The positive relationships that are built through Special Order 40 fire away at whatever minor inconvenience it is to a field officer, and the reality is that when people are arrested, we deal with their immigration status," said Charlie Beck, chief of police, according to the ABC 7 Los Angeles report.</p><p><br>Also condemning the law is the mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa.&nbsp; According to the Los Angeles Times, the mayor <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/04/villaraigosa-back-la-boycott-over-arizona-immigration-crackdown.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">backs</a> an L.A. boycott of Arizona, calling the law “unpatriotic” and “unconstitutional.”&nbsp;</p><p>Seven members of the Los Angeles City Council have signed a proposal supporting a boycott of Arizona businesses, which was authored by Councilman Ed Reyes.</p><p><br><br>In an aggressive effort to bring the disapproving views of Los Angeles officials to national attention, a council member even took to the cable television airwaves.&nbsp; <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/4172753/boycotting-arizona" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appearing</a> on the conservative Fox News Channel, Councilman Tony Cardenas called the law “irresponsible” and “unconstitutional,” invoking the reasoning behind Special Order 40.&nbsp; Serving the San Fernando Valley, Cardenas represents a heavily Hispanic constituency.</p><p><br><br>Los Angeles is not the only city potentially laying the foundation for more illegals to come to California. Residents in Northern California could be apprehensive as well.</p><p><br><br>According to the Wall Street Journal, other officials like Mayor Gavin Newsom from San Francisco <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/04/29/arizona-immigration-law-prompts-calls-for-boycotts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> an executive order that stops city officials from traveling to Arizona on official business. The Journal also reports that Oakland is considering similar action.</p><p><br><br>The Arizona law will not take effect until late July or early August; however, time will tell whether or not California will be ready to deal with a potential flood of more illegal immigrants.</p>
