<p>According to a report from a Santa Barbara television station, the immigration debate is making its way onto a local UC campus, becoming a <a href="http://www.keyt.com/news/local/90296937.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">prominent concern</a> with students seeking to hold President Obama accountable on the issue.</p><p><br><br>“[Immigration reform] is an urgency” said one student. “Families are getting separated, students are being barred from education [...],” said one high school student in the report.</p><p><br><br>Anticipating a nationwide rally taking place on Saturday (April 9), students all too excited about the movement held their immigration rally early.&nbsp; Like many hip policies that contemporary youth tend to be involved with, students are classifying their involvement in the immigration reform effort as fitting under the category of a ‘social justice’ issue.</p><p><br><br>Being labeled as such, the immigration reform effort is bound to pour gasoline on the flames of Glenn Beck types, who view the notion of social justice as a push by the far left to adopt certain policies many conservatives feel will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c4DqdleJuY" rel="noopener noreferrer">damage the nation</a>.</p><p><br><br>The on-campus rally is not the first time students are voicing their concern about the matter.&nbsp; According to the telecast, a small coalition actually spent their spring break to head to the massive DC immigration reform<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100321/ap_on_re_us/us_immigration_march" rel="noopener noreferrer"> march</a> held a few weeks ago. That particular rally, however, was overshadowed by the passionate push by the Tea Party rally against the newly passed healthcare legislation.</p><p><br><br>Like many on the side of a comprehensive immigration bill, these particular students seek an end to raids by immigration enforcement officials and view the current situation as not even being helpful to national security.&nbsp;</p><p>Current policies in place to aid immigrants in the education process include the California legislated DREAM Act (<a href="http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/AB540.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">AB 540</a>), allowing non-citizens in-state tuition.&nbsp; The same measure, however, prevents them from receiving financial aid.</p><p><br><br>Support for an immigration reform bill among the college-age demographic indicates a changing of the times when the sentiment toward illegal immigration is shifting.&nbsp; According to a recent Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-schnur8-2010apr08,0,4714189.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a>, support for the once popular Proposition 187 is shrinking. Whereas 60% of Californians voted for the original proposition in 1994, new polls cited in the Times indicate that support is evenly divided.</p><p><br><br>When it comes to the youth demographic, it was found that “those 18 to 29 opposed this proposal by more than a 20-point margin.”&nbsp; This opposition among the Californian youth differed from the stance of those aged 65 and over by a whopping 30 point margin.</p><p><br><br>The immigration debate in the California education system is certainly not a new issue. It also is not a trickle up affair, going from students up to faculty.&nbsp; Quite the contrary.</p><p>A few UC professors <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2010/03/12/university-california-could-be-subsidizing-illegal-immigration" rel="noopener noreferrer">received fire</a> for their using taxpayer money to develop a cell phone GPS phone application to aid immigrants in crossing the border into the United States.&nbsp; And now, the Voice of San Diego is <a href="http://voiceofsandiego.org/education/article_95fe775e-41f0-11df-a8f9-001cc4c03286.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> that one of those professors is being investigated by his UC San Diego employer for his role in that project.</p>
