<p>According to three Winston Group telephone surveys, 57% of Tea Party supporters are Republicans, while 41% are Democrats and Independents.&nbsp; Winston Group, a Republican leaning firm, utilized three surveys, each consisting of 1,000 registered voters, between December and February to accumulate the relevant <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/polls/90541-survey-four-in-10-tea-party-members-dem-or-indie?page=1#comments" rel="noopener noreferrer">data</a> on the burgeoning grassroots movement.</p><p>Here are some of the other pertinent highlights:</p><p>Most Tea Party supporters believe cutting both spending and taxes are the keys to creating jobs and reviving the economy</p><p>61% believe infrastructure spending creates jobs</p><p>By a wide margin, they support focusing more on unemployment than balancing the budget at this time</p><p>57% view congressional Republicans in a favorable light, while 75% view congressional Democrats in an unfavorable light</p><p>Over 80% disapprove of President Obama and the recently-passed healthcare reform bill</p><p>Almost 50% reported getting their news from Fox, and 10% cited talk radio as one of their top two news sources</p><p>While many pundits will likely criticize the surveys' accuracy due to the Winston Group's conservative slant, the surprising numbers may reveal a more balanced composition of the Tea Party than has been portrayed in various media outlets.</p><p>Perhaps a left-leaning poll firm would be willing to conduct a similar round of exhaustive surveys to confirm or falsify the Winston Group's latest findings.</p>
