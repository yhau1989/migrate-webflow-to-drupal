<p>This past Tuesday, President Obama signed legislation that is expected to increase access to college for millions of Americans.&nbsp; The student loan <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/us/politics/31obama.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul</a> was included as part of the health insurance reform package passed last week by the House and the Senate.</p><p><br><br>Specifically, the new law eliminates the billions of dollars in fees the federal government pays to private banks to provide loans to college students, loans that the federal government guarantees.&nbsp; The legislation is expected to save over $68 billion over 11 years that would normally have been paid as fees to the banks.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, these dollars will be used to increase Pell grants and to lend to students directly, generating income for the federal government as opposed to the banks.&nbsp; The legislation also will <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-03-30-student-loans_N.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">invest</a> more than $2 billion in community colleges over the next four years, as well as career training programs.</p><p><br><br>In anticipation of the legislation, many colleges and universities have already cut out the banks and moved directly toward lending to students, including UC Irvine.&nbsp; And while this law may not impact those schools as much as others, the move has already generated a saving of almost $20 billion federal dollars that would have been given to the banks.&nbsp;</p><p>California Representative George Miller (D-7), the chair of the House Education and Labor committee and strong advocate of this plan, was quoted as <a href="http://www.californiabusinesslawyerblog.com/2010/03/major-overhaul-of-federal-stud.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, “the Treasury is winning every day that somebody takes out a direct loan. The concept is already driving savings to the government."&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>While it’s too early to tell, the legislation may have been passed just in time to help California’s college students.&nbsp; In November 2009, the University of California approved a 32% tuition hike, and possible increases in tuition for California’s 112 <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/2010/03/31/1880429/key-agency-backs-community-college.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">community college</a> system may be just around the corner.&nbsp;</p><p>The student loan overhaul may be just what students need to combat the significant increase in their tuition rates next year.&nbsp;</p>
