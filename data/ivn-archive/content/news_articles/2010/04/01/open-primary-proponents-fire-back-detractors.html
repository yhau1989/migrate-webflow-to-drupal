<p>The open primary battle continues to generate a tremendous amount of political controversy.&nbsp; Over at <em>The Moderate Voice</em>, Nancy Hanks recently <a href="http://themoderatevoice.com/67924/ca-proposition-14-an-historical-american-fight-the-people-vs-the-parties/" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized</a> the two major parties, as well as Libertarians and Greens, for opposing the upcoming Top Two Open Primary ballot initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>She cited two key sources which offered a defense of the <a href="http://caivn.org/issue/open-primary-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer">open primary measure</a>.&nbsp; The first came from William P. Myers of the <a href="http://californiademocracy.blogspot.com/2010/03/catching-up-on-california-referenda-etc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Democracy</a> blog.&nbsp; He wrote:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't buy the fear-driven arguments of the California Democratic, Republican, and Green Parties.&nbsp; What is good for the citizens is not necessarily what is good for the parties.&nbsp; Incumbents tend to have a lock on elections in California, and so small groups of voters, the majority within the dominant party in each district, decide almost all elections in the primaries.</p><p>The second originated from Roger Clark, of <a href="http://foxandhoundsdaily.com/blog/roger-clark/6692-reclaiming-our-state-government" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox &amp; Hounds Daily</a>, who wrote:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early polling shows the Open Primary initiative has the overwhelming support of about two-thirds of registered voters.&nbsp; But the political parties will do everything within their power to defeat the initiative at polls.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The answers is as simple as it is frustrating.&nbsp; The Open Primary transfers political power to the ordinary man and woman.</p><p>Hanks concludes her blog by stating, "It's a fight Americans have been fighting since 1787 - the fight between the people and the parties".</p>
