<p>The California School Employees Association has filed a lawsuit to amend Proposition 14's language, and legislators, who voted for the initiative last year as part of a budget compromise, have directed their attorneys not to fight the legal challenge.&nbsp; If the lawsuit is successful, critical elements of the Top Two Open Primary initiative <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-open-primary8-2010mar08,0,1913305.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be stripped</a>.&nbsp; Proponents of the open primary measure are incensed and vow to mount a robust legal and public relations campaign.</p><p>The California School Employees Association, which is a major donor to the Democratic-controlled legislature, denies claims that it made a backroom deal with legislators.&nbsp; Dave Low, the lobbyist representing the school union, stated, "They are trying to make a connection that doesn't exist."&nbsp; Instead, Low argued that legislative attorneys, who have sided with the union, have agreed to change the initiative's language because it is "untrue" and "biased" in its current form.</p><p><a href="http://www.yeson14openprimary.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Californians for an Open Primary</a>, which includes AARP, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the California Business Roundtable has accused Democrats of using the school union to undermine the ballot initiative.&nbsp; "They don't want it to pass," said Steve Merksamer, an attorney from Californians for an Open Primary.&nbsp; "This measure goes to the heart of changing the system and changing their dominance."&nbsp;</p><p>Governor Schwarzenegger, a staunch proponent of the <a href="http://caivn.org/issue/open-primary-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer">open primary initiative</a>, will attempt to thwart the lawsuit.&nbsp; His spokesman, Matt David, said the deal reflects "Sacramento's dysfunction and why Californians have lost faith in its ability to solve problems.&nbsp; The governor will intervene in this case to fight for the reform that Californians overwhelmingly want."</p><p>Nathan Barankin, spokesman for state Senate leader Darrell Steinberg, scoffed at suggestions that Democrats had plotted to undermine the measure, calling them "bogus".</p><p>Stay tuned to the latest developments as Proposition 14 hangs in the balance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
