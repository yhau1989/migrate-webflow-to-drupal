<p>New America Foundation, an American based think tank, has claimed that nearly 33% of those killed by drones in Pakistan have been civilians.&nbsp; This <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/7361630/One-in-three-killed-by-US-drones-in-Pakistan-is-a-civilian-report-claims.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> corroborates <a href="http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=Pakistan+%26+Sub-Continent&amp;month=January2010&amp;file=World_News2010010283910.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a> made by Pakistani authorities earlier this year.</p><p><br><br>The largely secretive Drone program in Pakistan, headed by the CIA, has drawn heated criticism from human rights groups, antiwar organizations, and even some top military officials.&nbsp; In addition, according to a recent <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-drone-secrecy-criticised-qs-02" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> conducted by Gallup Pakistan, only 9% of Pakistanis supported the strikes.&nbsp; Despite this opposition, President Obama has continued to order a <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/08/where-has-anti-war-movement-gone" rel="noopener noreferrer">record number</a> of Drone strikes, far surpassing the total during the entire Bush administration.</p><p><br><br>Proponents argue that unmanned Predator Drone strikes are more economical and lower the probability of US troop casualties.&nbsp; They also question the accuracy of civilian death tolls, and often blame ruthless militants for blending in with the civilian population, leading to the unfortunate incidence of collateral damage.</p><p><br><br>Opponents argue that Drone attacks are unlawful, extrajudicial killings, since the United States has not declared war or granted Letters of Marque &amp; Reprisal, as stipulated in Article I Section 8 of the Constitution.&nbsp; Some top military officials, such as <a href="http://theindependentforum.blogspot.com/2010/01/drone-attacks-could-be-backfiring-on.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Kilcullen</a>, one of the architects of the 2007-2008 Iraq surge, as well as <a href="%20http://www.campaignforliberty.com/article.php?view=565" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philip Giraldi</a>, a 19 year counter-terrorism veteran of the CIA, claim that the high incidence of civilian casualties is actually creating more terrorists.&nbsp; Top trends forecaster, Gerald Celente, has even issued warnings of <a href="http://www.trendsresearch.com/journal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">another terrorist attack</a> against the US due to escalation in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p><p><br><br>So, what do you think?</p><p><br><br>Do you believe these attacks are lawful or unlawful?</p><p><br><br>Should we be more concerned with civilian casualties, or are they an unfortunate fact of life in the War on Terror?</p><p><br><br>Do you believe Drone attacks are making us more or less safe back home?</p>
