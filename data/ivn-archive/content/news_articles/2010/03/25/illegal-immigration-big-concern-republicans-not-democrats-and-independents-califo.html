<p>According to this week’s California Field Poll, no one issue is going to influence Californians in who they choose to be their next governor.&nbsp; In reality, they are <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2334.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">considering</a> a myriad of factors before they hit the ballot box in November.</p><p><br><br>By percentages, strong majorities rated Jobs/ the Economy (69%), the state budget deficit (68%), education (60%) and healthcare (51%) at the top of their list of concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only bipartisan consensus shared among registered Republicans and Democrats lay in finding the candidate to best address the state’s fiscal troubles.</p><p><br><br>The Field Poll made note of “significant differences” between Democrats and Republicans with regard to the issue of illegal immigration, however.&nbsp; Along party lines, Republicans place illegal immigration as a higher concern than Democrats. By no means, however, does that mean that Democrats don’t believe that illegal immigration is a problem at all. It just implies that they do not consider it a top issue.</p><p><br><br>Out of twelve issues listed in the poll, 37% of voters saw illegal immigration as “Among the most important.”&nbsp; Furthermore, concern for illegal immigration is down among polled participants from the 2006 gubernatorial election. In that year, 42% of survey participants found illegal immigration to be an issue of concern.</p><p><br><br>This year illegal immigration has taken a back seat to the economy. A mere 39% of those surveyed back in the 2006 poll were concerned about the economy.&nbsp; In the 2010 poll, the percentage of those concerned with economy skyrocketed to 69% of those polled, providing an indication that illegal immigration has been crowded out by an issue closer to the wallets of California voters.</p><p><br><br>Along party lines, 27% of Democrats believe illegal immigration to be an issue of importance while an overwhelming 58% of Republicans are really concerned about the issue.&nbsp; Identifying more with Democratic voters, 30% of nonpartisan voters were really concerned.</p><p><br><br>In light of the Field Poll’s finding, it provides a partial explanation for why gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner is continuing to fall behind in the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2010/03/17/2612376/field-poll-meg-whitman-trounces.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a>.&nbsp; For one thing, Meg Whitman is <a href="http://totalbuzz.freedomblogging.com/2010/03/23/whitman-outspending-foes-2-1-in-governor-race/32409/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pouring</a> a ton of cash into her campaign.&nbsp; Poizner simply does not have the resources that Whitman has.&nbsp; But for another, Poizner’s own election woes could be due to what key points he is emphasizing in his own campaign.</p><p><br><br>According to the Hill, Poizner is launching a 30 second illegal immigration <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/governor-races/88393-poizner-ad-targets-benefits-for-illegal-immigrants" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad</a> in which he labels illegal immigration as a “Liberal Failure.” The ad is coming out just after a protest for immigration reform that occurred in Washington DC over the weekend.</p><p><br><br>Nevertheless, Poizner’s fiscal conservatism is one that could resonate with lots of voters.&nbsp; It is also possible, though, that his fiscal message is being drowned out by what some voters could see as an overzealous attempt to deal with illegal immigration.</p><p><br><br>The Field Poll’s finding that illegal immigration concerns mostly Republicans lends credibility to speculation that Poizner’s political message is not reaching across the aisle to other voters.</p>
