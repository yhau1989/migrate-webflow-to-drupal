<p>Gerald Celente, considered one of the most accurate trends forecasters in the world, is sticking to his guns and predicting the rise of a legitimate third party candidate by 2012.&nbsp; And he claims it won't be a Tea Party candidate.&nbsp; At this early stage, he is calling this future prospect the "Internet Candidate".&nbsp; In Celente's view, the candidate will utilize the internet to tackle real issues, discuss specific platforms, and override the superficial "presidential reality show".</p><p>Celente labels himself a "political atheist" and has been highly critical of both the Bush and Obama administrations.&nbsp; He has also been extremely critical of the Federal Reserve, Wall St, and the military-industrial complex.&nbsp; While not perfect, Celente has a respectable track record in his thirty year trends forecasting career, and the last time he predicted the rise of a viable third party candidate, Ross Perot emerged right on cue in 1992.</p><p>And he is certainly not alone in this bold prediction, either.&nbsp; Senator Evan Bayh (D- Ind), who shocked the nation by announcing his intent to retire at the end of his term, issued a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/17/evan-bayh-predicts-third_n_466620.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar prediction</a> earlier this year, stating that 2012 could be a "Ross Perot Moment".</p><p>For a look at Mr. Celente's 2012 prediction, click <a href="http://www.bullsource.com/gerald-celente-predicts-tax-increases-2012-internet-candidate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to view the interview.</p><p>For more information on Celente, click <a href="http://www.trendsresearch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
