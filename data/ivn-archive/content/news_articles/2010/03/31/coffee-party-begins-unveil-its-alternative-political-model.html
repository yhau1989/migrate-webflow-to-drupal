<p>As the Coffee Party continues to garner national attention, it is beginning to present a more detailed framework for effecting cultural, political, and social change in America.&nbsp; Viewed as a left-leaning counter to the Tea Party, the Coffee Party is coming off a successful weekend "Summit", in which hundreds of local groups gathered at coffee shops around the nation to discuss the next steps toward pursuing meaningful reform.</p><p>In a C-SPAN <a href="http://www.coffeepartyusa.com/content/annabels-response-tea-party-vs-coffee-party-question" rel="noopener noreferrer">broadcast</a> of one of the Coffee Party's leading organizers, Annabel Park outlined the movement's general tenets and identified some key differences between it and the Tea Party.&nbsp;</p><p>Park stated that the Coffee Party views the Federal Government in a much more positive light compared to the Tea Party.&nbsp; In addition, she said that the grassroots movement is not interested in creating any type of third party; instead, it aims to work within the current system.&nbsp; Park also iterated that the Coffee Party is more of a "democracy movement" intent on pursuing functional government through a civil, rational, and collectivist majority.</p><p>With the introduction of a more codified political model, readers can now begin to critically analyze the movement's platform and put it to the test.</p><p>For example, while the Coffee Party movement seeks to "work from within", some Americans are becoming increasingly disenchanted with <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/03/10/jesse-ventura-calls-out-democrats-republicans-and-tea-party" rel="noopener noreferrer">both political parties</a>.&nbsp; Just like in 1992, when Ross Perot ran a viable third party campaign directed mainly at curbing rising government debt, a similar, albeit more passionate, thirst for change seems to be manifesting itself in these present times.&nbsp; Even one leading trends forecaster and a highly regarded Democratic Senator have <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/03/25/top-trends-forecaster-predicts-third-party-presidential-candidate-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted</a> the&nbsp; possibility of a third party contender by 2012.</p><p>Therefore, is the Coffee Party behind the curve on public sentiment?&nbsp; Are Americans actually ready to start looking outside the two-party system for real change?&nbsp;</p><p>The Coffee Party also advocates a much greater role for the Federal Government, while criticizing the Tea Party for "declaring war" on it.&nbsp; However, in our nation's earliest days, men like Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton battled over the proper roles of the federal and state governments.&nbsp; Hamilton, Washington, and the other "nationalists" advocated a powerful federal government, while Jefferson and his "Republican" followers advocated much greater authority for state and local governments.&nbsp; Men such as Hamilton viewed the federal government as the primary tool for effective governance, while men such as Jefferson constantly warned against the onslaught of excessive, open-ended federal power.</p><p>In 2010, is America shifting toward a more Jeffersonian view?&nbsp; If so, how would the Coffee Party adapt to this emerging trend?&nbsp; Would it challenge or integrate such a perspective?</p><p>The Coffee Party movement also appears to favor a more "democratic" vision for American politics, as opposed to a more "constitutional" vision which some Tea Party supporters espouse.&nbsp; Coffee Party leaders often speak of "democracy" and "majority", while Tea Party adherents, at least in their rhetoric, speak more of a constitutional republic.</p><p>What is the Coffee Party movement's view on the Constitution?&nbsp; Should it be changed in any way to reflect the 21st century? Or, should simple majority rule be utilized as the more practical means of enacting public policy?</p><p>Finally, though no poll has confirmed such speculation, one could reasonably surmise that a majority of Coffee Party supporters voted for Barack Obama.&nbsp; Yet, only 14 months into his presidency, which was touted as a catalyst for 'change', America is <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/27/year-later-nation-polarized-partisanship" rel="noopener noreferrer">more polarized than ever</a>, and the Coffee Party feels government is completely broken.</p><p>Is this then a tacit admission that President Obama has proven largely unsuccessful in living up to his campaign promises of change?&nbsp; Is this Obama's fault, Congress's fault, the media's fault, or the American people's fault? And how will the Coffee Party succeed when most everyone else seems to have failed?</p><p>These are just some of the issues Americans can begin investigating to better assess the Coffee Party model.&nbsp; Like the Tea Party, the Coffee Party is a nascent, but popular national movement that possesses tremendous potential to change the entire political landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*&nbsp; Editor's note:&nbsp; To read the previous two Coffee Party articles, click <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/03/14/coffee-party-looks-challenge-tea-party" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/03/24/coffee-party-vs-tea-party-battle-heats" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
