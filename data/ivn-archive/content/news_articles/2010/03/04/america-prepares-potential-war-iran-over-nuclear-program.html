<p>According to a recent Fox News poll, 60% of voters believe military force will be necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.&nbsp; 51% of independents, 51% of Democrats, and 75% of Republicans <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/02/fox-news-poll-iran-bomb-equals-disaster/?test=latestnews" rel="noopener noreferrer">think</a> a military strike will be required to thwart Iranian development of a nuclear weapons program.&nbsp;</p><p>If Iran were to develop such a program, 56% of voters believe it would be a disaster for security, while 37% believe it would be a "problem that can be managed".&nbsp; 50% of independents, 51% of Democrats, and 66% of Republicans believe it would prove a threat to US security.</p><p>As talks, under both the Bush and Obama administrations, have failed to yield any clear progress on halting Iranian nuclear development (whether for peaceful and/or military purposes), it appears as if the prospect of a military conflict is growing by the day.&nbsp; Recently, the US Senate joined the House in drafting its own version of a bill that would allow President Obama to enforce <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/28/senate.iran.sanctions/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">more severe sanctions</a> on the Islamic republic.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like the buildup to the Iraq war, are we witnessing the initial steps toward a full-fledged military strike against Iran?</p><p>Supporters of military action claim that Iran is in the final phases of developing nuclear weapons and that its oppressive regime repesents a direct threat to US national security, as well as Israel's.&nbsp; According to supporters, if Iran goes nuclear, it will be able to threaten the US and Israel, and sell its technology to terrorist groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Skeptics, however, point to a $1.4 trillion budget deficit, $14 trillion national debt, and the potential for skyrocketing oil prices as economic barriers to yet another war theater in the Middle East.&nbsp; They also point to the fact that both the United States and Israel possess a far greater military capability than Iran, even if it were to acquire nuclear technology.&nbsp; Some skeptics also challenge the accuracy of US intelligence, since the intelligence community's declarations regarding weapons of mass destruction and a Saddam Hussein-Al Qaeda link proved to be erroneous in Iraq.</p><p>Readers, what do you think?&nbsp; Let's hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>
