<p>Like him or hate him, Dr. Ron Paul doesn't just talk a big game about fiscal conservatism, he lives it.&nbsp; In 2008, his congressional office returned $58,000 to the Treasury.&nbsp; In 2009, his office returned <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/tx14_paul/SurplusBudget.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">$90,000</a>.&nbsp; Now, according to an official <a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>, Dr. Ron Paul's congressional office has just paid back $100,000.&nbsp;</p><p>At a time when Wall St is running wild, the national debt is $14 trillion, and the federal government is running $1.4 trillion deficits, Dr. Ron Paul's congressional office is running a surplus and paying back the American people.&nbsp; At a time when the federal government is paying record salaries and hiring record numbers as the rest of America suffers punishing unemployment, Dr. Ron Paul is operating his congressional office with a frugality that recognizes the current economic climate and respects the suffering of the American people.</p><p>Whether you like him or not, you have to respect the anti-war, fiscally conservative Republican Congressman.&nbsp; Unlike the vast majority of politicians, he doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk.&nbsp; If President Obama claims that he is serious about reigning in the runaway debt, perhaps he should install Dr. Ron Paul as the CEO of the bipartisan deficit commission.&nbsp; It appears he's the only one in the federal government with the track record to speak with the highest degree of credibility.</p>
