<p><span><span>In light of  China increasing its defense spending 7.5% this year, the Wall Street Journal conducted a </span></span><a href="http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/asias-question-day-783/topics/china-military-threat-us" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span>poll</span></span></span></a><span><span> entitled “</span></span><span><span>Is China a  military threat to the U.S.?</span></span><span><span>”&nbsp; As of this writing, 151 onli</span></span><span><span>ne visitors  have answered the poll, with 61% answering “no,” China is not a military  threat.&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span>The percentage  increase </span></span><span><span>was</span></span><span><span> actually lower tha</span></span><span><span>n expected—</span></span><span><span> under double  digits fo</span></span><span><span>r the first time in two decades—s</span></span><span><span>till, the  Pentagon believes this is an understated figure.&nbsp; Last year</span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> they estimated  China spent $105 to $150 billion, although they only reported $60</span></span><span><span>.19</span></span><span><span> billion.&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>If th</span></span><span><span>eir</span></span><span><span> figure is  correct, they are behind the UK ($60.79 billion) and France ($67  billion).&nbsp; In relation to their GDP, they are </span></span><span><span>also </span></span><span><span>behind Russia  ($40 billion).&nbsp; In first place, of course, is the United States ($696  billion).&nbsp; It will be unlikely our 2010 expenses will be any different,  with a stated budget </span></span><span><span>already </span></span><span><span>set at </span></span><a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12652" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span>$663.8 billion</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;

Instead, Pakistan and Asia are at the top  of the list.</span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span>What makes people  suspect China wants to attack us in the first place?&nbsp;
