<p>In examining immigration policy, those interested in the topic are apt to first look to traditional, English speaking media covering the matter.&nbsp; For Californians, this means reading the LA Times, The Daily News, The Sac Bee, The San Francisco Chronicle, etc.</p><p><br><br>In becoming preoccupied with English speaking outlets, the immigration issue from the “other perspective” gets shoved into a blind spot.&nbsp; A disclaimer: This isn’t a call to put on the suit of multiculturalism or to adopt the “other perspective” as one’s own.</p><p><br><br>Instead, it’s essentially a call similar to the wise maxim for watching cable political pundits: Consider more than one perspective to see an argument from the big picture.&nbsp; Looking to only one perspective risks turning one into a mindless, partisan cheerleader.</p><p><br><br>To be aware of what the other side has to say about current immigration issues aids in more effectively assessing the immigration situation.&nbsp; In this awareness, there’s still a need to read with a critical eye, considering whether certain concerns are fair ones.</p><p><br><br>In a fascinating angle of examining immigration, the Hispanic community voice raises a legitimate concern. Namely, it notes that both parties are solidly out of touch with proposing a solution to the immigration problem.</p><p><br><br>The Hispanic publication La Opinion recently <a href="http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=3e3f4cf7466906da6e930d76d8648a68" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> about the split within the Republican Party over immigration reform. Steve Poizner, running for the gubernatorial nomination against Meg Whitman, takes a hard stance on the immigration issue.&nbsp; Poizner, according to La Opinion, said that "illegal immigrants are overwhelming our education, health care and public benefits systems.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, his counterpart, Whitman, advocates a more moderate approach to immigration reform, according to the same publication.</p><p><br><br>The implication is that the Republican Party lacks consensus on immigration reform, a more than accurate assessment <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2010/02/23/cpac-exposes-gop-split-over-illegal-immigration" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted</a> at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).&nbsp; This lack of consensus in the Republican Party is certainly a factor continuing to plague it, despite an effort by conservatives to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703791504575079732815974568.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">push</a> more Hispanic conservative candidates.</p><p><br><br>As much as the the Hispanic community gives grief to Republicans for lack of vision, Democrats aren’t exempted from Hispanic ire.&nbsp; The liberal organization, the National Council of La Raza (NCLA), called out President Obama for his unkept promise to implement immigration reform in a timely manner.</p><p><br><br>NCLA recently released a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKkrdIqjSaw&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of President Obama addressing a Hispanic crowd earlier last year, showering them with immigration reform promises.&nbsp; Agree or disagree with NCLA in terms of their ultimate vision for an immigration reform bill, they too make an overall valid criticism of current political party structure.</p><p><br><br>Their point? Democratic leadership has labeled itself as the party of minorities and of diversity.&nbsp; But when it comes to actually delivering the goods, there are more politically expedient measures to focus on (i.e. Healthcare reform).&nbsp; It’s actually worse to promise something and not deliver it.&nbsp; It ultimately begs the question, do the Democratic elites really care for minorities?</p><p><br><br>The biggest implication is that both parties seem to be out of touch with minorities, being more concerned with pandering to their base and courting special interest money.&nbsp; In a sense, independents and Hispanics share a commonality.&nbsp; Both parties are ignoring their concerns and needs.</p><p><br><br>This isn’t necessarily a call for instituting a third party, but a call for a better class of candidates to come forward in future elections. Citizens need candidates who are actually interested in the well-being of their constituents and&nbsp;in making the American dream available to those willing to work within the system in a fair manner.</p>
