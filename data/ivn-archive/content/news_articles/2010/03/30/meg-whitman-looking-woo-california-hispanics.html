<p>As previously noted, California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman is differentiating herself from her more fiery counterpart Steve Poizner in addressing issue of <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/03/16/california-republican-party-divided-over-illegal-immigration" rel="noopener noreferrer">illegal immigration</a>.&nbsp; With her recent <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-whitman27-2010mar27,0,7923131.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">op-ed</a> in the Los Angeles Times, any cloudiness surrounding her stance on the issue should be less murky.</p><p><br><br>Emerging is a clearer picture of where she’ll lean if she wins in November.&nbsp; Her case and point is that immigration must be a “top priority” for state’s next governor in November.&nbsp; While saying that California benefits from legal immigration, Whitman seeks to portray herself as having a firm grasp of the current illegal immigration problem, neither endorsing the “status quo” nor a “full amnesty.”</p><p><br><br>In painting herself as a candidate serious about tackling illegal immigration, she acknowledged that the Feds have a responsibility to reimburse the state for funds expended in fighting the problem.&nbsp; What stands out in Whitman’s op-ed piece is the way in which she applies the term “immigrant,” using it to refer only to Hispanics.</p><p><br><br>Through her use of the term, other legal minorities who come to the state to contribute might be alienated, however.&nbsp; After all, their contributions are seemingly marginalized by Whitman in her overshadowing them with her desperately needed Hispanic voter demographic.&nbsp; How Whitman’s narrow use of the term will play out with other minorities at the polls in November remains to be seen.</p><p><br><br>It is quite clear that she is trying to extend a hand to the Hispanic demographic, especially with her acknowledgement of the work ethic that legal Hispanics bring to the state’s economy.&nbsp; Whitman brings to light the struggle that Republicans have long had to deal with; that is, in challenging her party not to appear anti-Hispanic and to effectively appeal to the traditional values many Hispanics hold.</p><p><br><br>In an effort to offset potential political fallout for her past opposition to Proposition 187, Whitman explained in the op-ed her rationale for opposing the legislation, addressing her critics on the issue.&nbsp; Being straightforward on the issue, she boldly acknowledged that she stands against cutting medical and education benefits for children of illegal immigrants.&nbsp; “I do not believe that kids should be punished for the sins of their parents,” she said in her op-ed.</p><p><br><br>While there is a yet a poll to show Whitman’s favorability with Hispanics, a possible indication surfaced at a recent meeting with Hispanic business leaders.&nbsp; According to the San Jose Mercury News, Whitman <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_14704364?nclick_check=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out</a> to a group of Hispanic business leaders, stressing their vital role in the path to economic recovery in California.</p><p><br><br>According to that same article, Whitman has some Hispanic leaders considering lending their support to her in November.</p>
