<p>As the Tea Party "vows revenge over the health overhaul", the Coffee Party is mobilizing a massive, nationwide Coffee Party Summit this weekend.&nbsp; Emboldened by its rapidly growing fan base on Facebook, a hip new website, and 350-400 grassroots coordinated events nearly two weeks ago, the Coffee Party is looking to take the next big step toward becoming a legitimate political force.</p><p><br><br>On Saturday and Sunday, members of the <a href="http://www.coffeepartyusa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Party movement</a> will be gathering all across the nation to prepare for civil discourse with their local, Congressional representatives over the Easter recess.* Coffee Party activists claim that they are frustrated by paralyzing government gridlock, incessant partisan vitriole, and a media that does not truly represent their views.&nbsp; Many Coffee partiers also claim that the Tea Party's inflammatory rhetoric and belligerent style are counterproductive and ostracizing, even though they agree that the political system is broken.</p><p><br><br>While the Coffee Party welcomes Americans from all across the political spectrum, a perusal of signs, videos, and leader bios does appear to reveal a left-leaning political bent.&nbsp; So, much like the Tea Party's claims of strict "non-partisanship" are contradicted by its anti-Obama, anti-Democrat rhetoric, Coffee Party claims of nonpartisan purity should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.</p><p><br><br>Nevertheless, the Coffee Party movement is shaping up to be an extremely competitive counter to the Tea Party.&nbsp; Its calls for civil and rational discourse, as well as a solution-oriented agenda, are appealing to many Americans who feel politics has turned into a "den of vipers".</p><p><br><br>Ideally, the healthy competition between the two camps will spark productive dialogue and genuine political change, instead of further dividing a nation that is <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/27/year-later-nation-polarized-partisanship" rel="noopener noreferrer">more polarized</a> under President Obama than it was under President Bush.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>* Editor's note:&nbsp; CAIVN would like to invite those who attend this weekend's Coffee Party Summit to come back and share their experiences on this comment thread.</p>
