<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/smog.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="259" src="cloudinary://smog.jpg" title="smog" width="400"></a>Answer quickly:&nbsp; what does climate change have to do with Prop 13?&nbsp; Apparently, more than we thought, because the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association (HJTA) has joined leagues with Texas-based Valero Energy Corporation <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/2010/03/mystery-over-va.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">to fight</a> California AB32, one of the principle legislative tools for the state to address global warming and air cleanliness.</p>
<p>There’s no question that the Jarvis group, which spends most of its time defending the impact of the 30 year old proposition that was initiated by its late namesake, brings a lot of value to the coalition – it’s from California, as opposed to its partner, which is from the most pollution-laden state in the nation (remember – that used to be us).</p>

<p>One of the key provisions of AB-32 is the 2020 target for renewable energy sources supplied to the statewide power grid.&nbsp; That number has grown from 20 percent to 33 percent under a recent gubernatorial mandate, and the result has been a boon to the renewable power industries such as solar and wind.</p>

<p>In recent days, California’s aggressive support of renewable resources has brought jobs to Sacramento, as Roseville’s Solar Power Inc. <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2010/03/10/2595673/roseville-solar-start-up-gets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that it would transition in-source manufacturing of its solar photo-voltaic panels from China to California.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tangentially, another important solar project was <a href="http://www.rgj.com/article/20100307/NEIGHBORHOODS/3070324" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduled</a> to be announced in nearby Sparks, NV next week, supported by NV Energy's SolarGenerations program that encourages the integration of renewable resources into the state’s overall power equation.</p>

<p>Solar Power Inc.’s decision to move its manufacturing from China to the U.S. resurrects the Sacramento region’s solar opportunities, which were <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2009/02/14/solar-future-dims-despite-promise-stimulus" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashed</a> some months ago when the now-defunct OptiSolar’s 1,000-person plant site was scrapped because of the economic downturn.</p>
<p>So, why does a growing solar industry threaten the tax-cutting advocates who are part of the HJTA?&nbsp; Perhaps they object to governmental subsidies of these nascent “green” industries.&nbsp; But, we subsidized telegraphy, telephony, and agriculture with considerable success.&nbsp; We even subsidize Valero and its companion corporations in the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp; And we subsidize every homeowner in California through Howard Jarvis’ original idea to cut property taxes, and through federal and state tax breaks on mortgage interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, HJTA's opposition to green subsidies would appear to be internally inconsistent.</p>
