<p><span><span>Recently  America has witnessed two notable acts of— what some are calling—  domestic terrorism.&nbsp; Most recent was the </span></span><a href="http://www.wusa9.com/news/breaking/story.aspx?storyid=98041&amp;catid=158" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>Pentagon  shooter</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp; John Patrick Bedell drove from California to Washington DC  in order to open fire on the Pentagon with two 9mm handguns and a trunk  full of ammunition.&nbsp; He injured two officers before being shot down  himself, on March 4</span></span><span><sup><span>th</span></sup></span><span><span>.&nbsp; Exactly two weeks earlier (Feb 18</span></span><span><sup><span>th</span></sup></span><span><span>), Andrew Joseph Stack III flew  his plane into an Austin (TX) IRS building.&nbsp; Both had left  behind manifestos.&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><span>Immediately  after the Austin crash, it was evident that the bulk of the media </span></span><span><span>made certain</span></span><span><span> not</span></span><span><span> to</span></span><span><span> classify this as an act of  terrorism</span></span><span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>The Department of  Homeland Security released a statement saying: “At this time, we have no reason  to believe there is a nexus to terrorist activity,” as reported by </span></span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/18/texas.plane.crash/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>CNN</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp; Neither case appears to be a  “lone wolf” operation either, which the FBI defines as an individual on  the fringes of a formal extremist group.&nbsp; Ho</span></span><span><span>pefully this assessment holds,  because i</span></span><span><span>f  an “extremist group” was identified </span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>according to their manifestos</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span><span>, it would most likely include someone you know.&nbsp; That is,  their rants and raves are not too dissimilar to that of many modern day  protesters.</span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><span>With  that said, in a literal sense, it is hard to argue that they are not  terrorists.&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>According  to </span></span><span><span>1984 US  Army manuals</span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> the definition of terrorism is  “the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals  that are political, religious, or ideological in nature...through  intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear.”&nbsp; In April 2008 the </span></span><a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9236/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>CFR published</span></span></span></span></a> <span><em><span>Militant Extremists in  the United States,</span></em></span><span><span> which stated that the USA Patriot Act “defines domestic  terrorism as criminal acts that are ‘dangerous to human life’ and seem  to be meant to scare civilians or affect policy,”</span></span> <span><span>noting that “civil rights groups  have expressed concern that this definition is overly broad.”&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span>If  the definition</span></span><span><span>s above are used,</span></span><span><span> then the question ought to be whether or not the two  perpetrators were acting senselessly with serious mental illness, or  consciously with a “goal” in mind</span></span><span><span> to “affect policy” and enforce an “ideology”</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp; For anyone familiar with the  case, the answer is undoubtedly the latter.&nbsp; Although mental illness is  said to play a role in both c</span></span><span><span>ases (naturally), they also had definite</span></span><span><span> goals.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In 2007, Wikipedia displayed</span></span><span><span> a post allegedly</span></span> <span><span>written by </span></span><span><span>the Pentagon shooter</span></span><span><span>, under the name </span></span><span><span>“</span></span><span><span>JPatrickBedell” </span></span><span><span>(post </span></span><span><span>now removed</span></span><span><span> – it can still </span></span><span><span>be found </span></span><a href="http://mediaelites.com/2010/03/05/j-patrick-bedell-on-wikipedia/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>here</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>)</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp; Within the post, the author  seeks justice for the “</span></span><a href="http://www.colonelsabow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>death of Colonel James Sabow</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>” in 1991, which was ruled a  suicide despite evidence to the contrary (he was found in his backyard  beaten badly, for one).&nbsp; He somehow </span></span><span><span>associates</span></span><span><span> this </span></span><span><span>case </span></span><span><span>with the “coup” regime of 1963 (indicating LBJ’s assumption of  the presidency after the assassination of JFK).&nbsp; He maintains that this  regime is responsible for the “global drug trade, financial corruption,  and murder, among other crimes.”&nbsp; He then mentions September 11</span></span><span><sup><span>th</span></sup></span><span><span> very briefly,</span></span><span><span> referring it to a  “demolition,”</span></span><span><span> then makes an interesting comment comparing himself</span></span><span><span> to</span></span><span><span> “the odd German still  complaining about the murders of the Night of the Long Knives” </span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>when Hitler transferred power  from the SA to the SS </span></span><span><span>via</span></span><span><span> a series of assassinations</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; Obviously this man was  educated well and followed government conspiracy closer than most (JFK  and 9/11 theories are well known, but who is Colonel Sabow, and what is  his connection?).</span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><span>Joe Stack wrote a </span></span><a href="http://goingconcern.com/2010/02/the-full-text-of-josephs-stack-insane-manifesto-details-his-struggles-with-irs/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>manifesto</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> as well, with a defined  ideology and goal.&nbsp; When Joe Stack was young with little money for food,  he lived across an elderly woman who tried to convince him that eating  cat food was “healthier” than bread and peanut butter.&nbsp; Her  husband worked 30 years in a mill and lost his pension and medical care  upon retirement due to incompetent management and a corrupt union.&nbsp;  After his </span></span><span><span>demise</span></span><span><span>, she found herself in poor  financial shape, to say the least.&nbsp; This early life lesson left him  determined not to </span></span><span><span>rely on</span></span><span><span> “big business”</span></span><span><span> and</span></span> <span><span>to </span></span><span><span>take  care of his </span></span><span><span>own </span></span><span><span>retirement.&nbsp;  After years of self-employment, he details his battle with the IRS and  new tax laws that </span></span><span><span>strongly favored large corporations and thereby </span></span><span><span>strangled his financial  fortitude beyond repair.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Joe was convinced that there “</span></span><span><span>are two ‘interpretations’ for  every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us,” and that  “the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws,”  sentiments many would agree with today.&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>He concludes in the end that  without a body count nothing will ever change.&nbsp; He sacrificed his life  in order to prove this conclusion.&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><span>He was right, but  not in the positive way he anticipated.&nbsp; Thanks to him and the “Pentagon  shooter,” more stringent legislation will befall innocent American  citizens. Coincidentally, on t</span></span><span><span>he</span></span><span><span> same</span></span><span><span> day </span></span><span><span>as</span></span><span><span> the Pentagon attack, Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the </span></span><a href="http://assets.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/ARM10090.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>‘‘Enemy  Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010’’</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp; If protesters and other 1</span></span><span><sup><span>st</span></sup></span><span><span> Amendment practitioners  thought their rights to a fair trial were in jeopardy before, this bill  will add a new dimension of legality to previously questionable  detainment.&nbsp; As the </span></span><a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/usnews/congress/3090-mccain-lieberman-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span><span><span>New  American points out</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>:</span></span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  bill's definition of</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>“enemy belligerent” could be interpreted to mean a number of  things. The bill tells us (Sec. 6, paragraph 9): “The term 'unprivileged  enemy belligerent' means an individual … who (a) has engaged in  hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; (b) has  purposely and materially supported hostilities against the United  States or its coalition partners; </span></span><span><em><span>or </span></em></span><span><span>(c) was a part of al Qaeda at the time of  capture.” Note the </span></span><span><em><span>or</span></em></span><span><span> in that sentence (italics added). It is very important…&nbsp;  Anyone who fits those other provisions, whatever they mean, could be  detained under this Act.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Definitions  (a) and (b) use the term “hostilities” as </span></span><span><span>a </span></span><span><span>way to identify an individual  susceptible to this Act.&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>T</span></span><span><span>he  definitions of the word “hostile”</span></span><span><span> are:</span></span></p><p><span><span>1. </span></span><span><span>of, pertaining to, or  characteristic of an enemy: a hostile nation. </span></span></p><p><span><span>2. </span></span><span><span>opposed in feeling, action, or  character; antagonistic: </span></span><span><span>hostile criticism. </span></span></p><p><span><span>3. </span></span><span><span>characterized by antagonism. </span></span></p><p><span><span>4. </span></span><span><span>not friendly, warm, or  generous; not hospitable. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Does  this include the</span></span><span><span> many journalists, protesters and amateur bloggers “not  friendly” or “opposed in feeling” towards the actions of our government  or its “</span></span><span><span>coalition  partners”?&nbsp; The implications of this Act are dreadful.&nbsp; Unfortunately,  domestic terrorism</span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> or, however you define the recent acts of </span></span><span><span>these </span></span><span><span>desperate individuals</span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> only gives more motive (read:  excuses) to offer up legislation such as this.</span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span>I</span></span><span><span>f you sympathize in part with their manifestos</span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> rest assured</span></span><span><span> that</span></span><span><span> you are not crazy.&nbsp; However,  please do the rest of us a favor and write your representatives instead  of resorting to violent acts.&nbsp; The results are horrendous, not only from  a human life perspective, but a legislative one as well.</span></span><span><br></span></p>
