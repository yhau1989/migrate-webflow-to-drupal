<p>It looks like the Tea Party has some competition.&nbsp; In a bid to offer an alternative to the burgeoning Tea Party movement, the Coffee Party kicked off its first, coordinated meetups on Saturday.&nbsp; Billed as a counter to the more conservative Tea Party, the Coffee Party originally launched a Facebook group about six weeks ago, and in less than two months, the group has already attracted more than 141,000 fans.&nbsp; Yesterday, Coffee Party leaders held between 350-400 events at coffee shops across the nation.&nbsp; Attendees from across the political spectrum discussed healthcare reform, divisive partisanship, and a media that is seemingly out of touch with ordinary Americans.</p><p>Brendan Steinhauser, a Tea Party director for FreedomWorks, criticized the new Coffee Party movement, stating "This Coffee Party looks like a weak attempt at satire or a manufactured response to a legitimate widespread grassroots movement."&nbsp; Coffee Party founder and Democratic activist, Annabel Park, responded, "It's a response to how they are trying to change our government..It's their methodology that we are against.&nbsp; We may want some of the same things, but their journey is so alienating to us."</p><p>The Coffee Party <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/13/coffee.party/index.html?hpt=T2" rel="noopener noreferrer">plans</a> major national action on March 27, when members across the country will discuss how to engage members of Congress over Easter recess.&nbsp; On CNN's 'American Morning', Annabel Park said, "Just like in the American Revolution, we are looking for real representation right now.&nbsp; We don't feel represented by our government right now, and we don't really feel represented well by the media either."</p><p>Readers, what's your take on this new Coffee Party?</p><p>Will it unite independent-minded voters or deepen the partisan divide?</p><p>Will it lead to genuine political reform or be assimilated by the two-party system?</p>
