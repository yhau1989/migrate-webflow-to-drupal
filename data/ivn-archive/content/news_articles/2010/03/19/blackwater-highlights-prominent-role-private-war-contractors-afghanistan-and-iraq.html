<p><span>There are over 242,000 Defense Department contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. &nbsp;This at times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/world/asia/02contractors.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">exceeds</a> the amount of troops we have officially deployed. &nbsp;The cost is well over $100 billion to American taxpayers.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The <a href="http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/usa/US-Senators-Criticize-Blackwater-Contractors-in-Afghanistan-85250697.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee met a few weeks ago</a> to address the acts of Blackwater in Afghanistan, "accusing them of ignoring regulations and threatening the American mission there." &nbsp;(Due to many questionable acts leading to unnecessary civilian casualties, Blackwater recently changed their name to "Xe," presumably in hopes to whitewash their reputation.)</span></p><p><span>Afghans do not distinguish between contractors and uniformed soldiers. &nbsp;In light of this fact, Senator McCaskill (D-MO) says "we have two sets of rules and one image." &nbsp;The "image" she refers to is one shared by all Americans. &nbsp;It has been damaged enough by our own official military expeditions, and now it is further jeopardized by the irresponsibility of private war contractors.</span></p><p><span>Xe Services not only continues to employ in Afghanistan, but they were nearly awarded another $1.1 billion contract from the U.S. Army. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/world/blackwater-loses-11bn-afghan-police-contract-20100316-qcii.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortunately</a>, Congress put a stop to the contract, with Senator Levin (D-MI) reminding members that it operated "with almost no consideration of the rules it was legally obligated to follow." &nbsp;This includes stealing rifles and pistols from U.S. run armories intended for Afghan forces.</span></p><p><span>There was a time when wars were fought using mercenary armies under the direction of kings and aristocracies. &nbsp;Since the American and French Revolution, a "new kind of war" has been fought. &nbsp;Bertrand Russell describes this war as "one in which the whole nation participates enthusiastically because it believes that it has something of value to defend." &nbsp;In fact, he even states, "This is one of the strongest reasons for expecting democracy to survive." (Understanding History, 1957)</span></p><p><span>After the revolutions of the late 18th century, people were further empowered to participate in ruling affairs. &nbsp;However temporary and illusionary this freedom actually was, no doubt it was (and still is) a belief held by many. &nbsp;Therefore, in the aftermath of the world revolutions, governments have benefited greatly from the new ideology that accompanied modern liberation. &nbsp;This new application of democracy lent larger armies to the State. &nbsp;Soldiers displayed passion and zeal to fight voluntarily, with minimal pay. &nbsp;Honor and respect were bestowed upon their return.</span></p><p><span>Today, uniformed soldiers are under international pressure to avoid genocide, killing non-combative civilians, raping, pillaging, etc. &nbsp;Any of these acts performed must be minimized or concealed. &nbsp;Mercenary soldiers have only recently come to public attention. &nbsp;In fact, one could argue, <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92979524.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">had they followed the rules</a> the public at large would have had no idea they were being employed.</span></p><p><span>It may be true— especially in these uncertain economic times— that many within our armed forces have committed to fight for financial security alone. &nbsp;In this sense, they are not much unlike private war contractors. &nbsp;Of course, they are only paid about one-fourth of what a private contractor can make (which, incidentally, makes them ideal recruits). &nbsp;Private war contractors are paid by the same people who pay soldiers: US taxpayers. &nbsp;We are privatizing our military with rewards hard to ignore: a lot more money with less rules and responsibility.</span></p><p><span>Their pay isn't exactly capped, either. &nbsp;Earlier this year, Juan Gonzalez (<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2010/1/8/blackwatergate_private_military_firm_in_firestorm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democracy Now!</a>) said that "Blackwater is reportedly paying $100,000 for each of the Iraqis killed by its forces and between $20,000 to $30,000 to each Iraqi wounded." &nbsp;House representative Schakowsky (D - IL) was interviewed during the show. &nbsp;She asked the pertinent question: "why would anyone hire this company, which is a repeat offender, threatening the mission of the United States… and also known to threaten and kill innocent civilians? It is just amazing to me…" &nbsp;She frequently <a href="http://www.janschakowsky.org/news" rel="noopener noreferrer">informs</a> us that 40 cents of every dollar goes to a private contractor— although this is only an estimation, another telling fact (if a Congresswoman has to estimate, what hope does the public have for obtaining the truth?).</span></p><p><span>So why hire them—or any war contractors at all? &nbsp;Is this a sign that democracy is failing—i.e. that we have to pay contractors to fight our wars like kings and aristocrats of old? &nbsp;Or are military powers intentionally trying to avert long standing internationally conceded upon laws of war?</span></p><p><span>Military authorities the world over will sidestep legitimate operatives in order to achieve objectives otherwise unattainable. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/world/asia/15contractors.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times reported</a> a recent example of this. &nbsp;It appears that we are not only sending unmanned drones to attack in Pakistan, but also running off-the-book operations with contracted covert spies, which is generally considered illegal. &nbsp;Most likely these operations are improperly financed, and "may be seen as an attempt to get around the Pakistani government's prohibition of American military personnel's operating in the country."</span></p><p><span>Is civilization moving forward towards diplomacy and peace, or backwards into a renewed state of barbarianism? &nbsp;Modern war is so atrocious that it begs the question whether there is such a thing as Western Civilization. &nbsp;Perhaps this is why when Gandhi was asked what he thought of Western Civilization, he replied: "I think it would be a very good idea."</span></p>
