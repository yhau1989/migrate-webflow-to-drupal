<p>California is the largest purchaser of textbooks in the United States.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with the state’s economy in shambles, California has decided to hold off on buying new textbooks until 2014.&nbsp; The question is, which textbooks will the state be buying?&nbsp; For years, California drove what information was included in textbooks across the nation.&nbsp; However, with the purchase of text books so far off, California’s influence may soon be replaced -- by the state of Texas.&nbsp; After California, Texas has the second largest textbook market and wields <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/education/13texas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tremendous influence</a> over what information is included in textbooks and effectively, the nation.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>Last week, the Texas State Board of Education debated what to include, remove, and revise in the state’s current textbooks.&nbsp; Specifically, the Board approved numerous revisions to the Texas social studies books that appear to rewrite history to align with the conservative majority’s viewpoint.&nbsp; For example, the Board inserted language that questions whether or not the Founding Fathers sought a more secular government.&nbsp; Specifically, the books will now highlight the Judeo-Christian influences of the Founding Fathers while seemingly dismissing their commitment to separation of church and state.&nbsp; In fact, the Board went so far as to remove Thomas Jefferson from the textbook completely.&nbsp; Jefferson Davis is placed on equal footing with Abraham Lincoln, and Republicans are supposedly portrayed in a much more positive light, including Joe McCarthy.&nbsp; On the other hand, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-15870-Populist-Examiner%7Ey2010m3d14-Texas-school-board-revising-curriculum-creating-controversy" rel="noopener noreferrer">efforts</a> to remove Thurgood Marshall as the first African-American Supreme Court Justice and the role he played in Brown v. Board of Education were unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>When questioned, California state officials <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/03/12/MN7N1CF2DF.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the state has its own standard and has no use for the Texas textbooks.&nbsp; According to Department of Education spokeswoman Hilary McLean, "California is such a large consumer, it's more of a driver in this scenario rather than being influenced by other states' textbook adoption.&nbsp; Any textbooks adopted in California are going to follow our standards."</p><p><br><br><br>The Texas State Board of Education will take a final vote in May 2010 to approve the final language in the revised textbooks.&nbsp; Additional changes are not expected.</p>
