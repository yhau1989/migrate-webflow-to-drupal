<p>It appears that recent government-proposed solutions to staggering financial circumstances are not working.&nbsp; At the federal level, the Obama administration must deal with a pessimistic report that TARP funds <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=35478" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren’t lifting</a> the struggling institutions it promised to help (TARP funds intended to assist in relieving the inflated housing bubble and in stimulating small businesses among other designated purposes).</p><p><br><br>At the state level, California faces a similar situation in assessing government-proposed solutions to their budgetary problems. Put simply, the state government’s “solutions” are not working either.&nbsp; Similar to the report that measured the success of TARP funds in stabilizing the financial sector, there is a <a href="http://www3.senate.ca.gov/deployedfiles/vcm2007/senoversight/docs/furloughsfranchisetaxboard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">state report</a> from the California Senate Office of Oversight evaluating the success of furloughs for the Franchise Tax Board (FTB).</p><p><br><br>Their conclusion: furloughs are not working as intended.</p><p><br><br>The furloughs of 5,300 workers at the FTB will take a toll on California’s general fund, costing it seven times more tax money than it saves, the report said.&nbsp; Gov. Schwarzenegger’s vision of accumulating revenue from these cuts crashes and burns, costing $465 million in lost taxes according to the report.</p><p><br><br>The reason for lost revenue is due to a lack of common sense exercised in making the cuts. Here’s why: The job of the FTB is to generate revenue through “audits and collection efforts,” the report said.&nbsp; How is revenue supposed to be generated if the work days are siphoned from the FTB? This essentially means less productivity.</p><p><br><br>With furlough days, the FTB is less available to generate much needed funds, offsetting by 28% the $1.66 billion in general fund money expected to be saved by furloughing workers two to three days a month.&nbsp; The report compared budget-cutting measures applied by the Board of Equalization (BOE) compared with the FTB’s furloughs.&nbsp; The conclusion is that the BOE lost $6.36 for every dollar saved while the FTB’s furloughs lost $7.15 for every dollar saved.</p><p><br>BOE is an independent agency outside the governor’s jurisdiction, which makes it able to avoid mandated furloughs. They still faced deep cuts from the governor, totaling 14%.&nbsp; While not perfect in avoiding the budget ax, the BOE’s system of budget cuts (as opposed to furloughs) demonstrates their ability to minimize their losses more so than the FTB.</p><p><br><br>The governor also proposed “boosted funding” and “hiring for tax collectors” in the coming fiscal year.&nbsp; Ironically, however, <br>this is coming from the same governor who campaigned against the tax crazy culture of Sacramento.&nbsp; Unlike what is taking place at the federal level, the California state government is not bailing out tanking financial institutions.</p><p><br><br>Rather, the big fad vocabulary in California right now is “cuts” and “furloughs,” terms Sacramento heads of state are throwing around like candy wrappers.&nbsp; Granted, cuts are necessary in some areas, but do the facts say?</p><p><br><br>There are more cost-effective ways to save money. One way of NOT generating revenue is by crippling the agencies whose responsibility entails constructing monetary generating solutions.</p>
