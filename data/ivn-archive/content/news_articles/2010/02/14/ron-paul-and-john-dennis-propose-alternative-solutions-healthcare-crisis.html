<p>Our current healthcare system costs about twice per capita compared to other industrialized countries, with drug prices two to three times as high.&nbsp; Prices have risen exponentially, much faster than the rate of inflation.&nbsp; Not to mention that 40 – 50 million Americans have no healthcare insurance coverage whatsoever, many of whom are children.&nbsp; For decades, this issue has been a major concern for many American citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>At a time when our country is engaged in a war on two fronts and legislation is being written at a dizzying pace, Congress&nbsp; decided to take action.&nbsp; The action was immediately praised, but that praise diminished significantly when the proposed legislation was revealed to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>For instance, the “single payer” option was quickly dropped from the House bill and subsequently from congressional dialogue.&nbsp; A “public option” was introduced to compete with high prices, yet in the Senate bill this was also dropped.&nbsp; In a timely fashion, Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced an amendment that would allow states to implement such accommodations independently of the federal government.&nbsp; It was stripped from the House bill, yet did influence legislatures nationwide, evident in the recent passing of <a href="http://www.truthout.org/california-senate-approves-single-payer-health-care-bill56521" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB-810</a>, which calls for a single-payer system in California.&nbsp; It is expected that Governor Schwarzenegger will veto the bill, as he has done twice previously to kill similar proposals.</p>
<p><br><br>One aspect of the proposed bill is particularly troubling to many Americans.&nbsp; What is sometimes called the “healthcare-or-jail” part of the bill imposes penalties on those who do not secure health insurance.&nbsp; Therefore, it certainly can be said that this bill is maintaining— and even benefiting— the privatized healthcare system that frustrated so many citizens to begin with.&nbsp; Fines (which may escalate to imprisonment) will not be prevalent, however, since most people receive a paycheck from a legitimate, legally adhering corporation in exchange for their labor.&nbsp; If they are “legally adhering,” they will simply deduct a percentage from the paychecks of those who do not have health insurance.&nbsp; Like the income tax—and we know how popular that is— this deduction will be nonnegotiable, regardless of its constitutional legitimacy.</p>
<p><br>States are fighting back, though, beginning with Virginia.&nbsp; They recently passed a <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/79713-the-year-of-state-sovereignty" rel="noopener noreferrer">bill</a> that prohibits Virginians from being required to purchase healthcare.&nbsp; Other states are expected to follow suit, and many Americans are seeking an alternative solution.</p>
<p><br><br>Dr. Ron Paul and CA congressional candidate, John Dennis, have suggested alternative solutions to our problematic healthcare system: make healthcare expenses tax deductible.&nbsp; “We should be very generous with tax credits. Give tax credits for the entire amount of money you spend on medical care, so you can be independent,” said <a href="http://www.ronpaul.com/2009-06-19/ron-paul-how-to-solve-the-healthcare-c..." rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul</a>.&nbsp; John Dennis <a href="http://www.johndennis2010.com/issues/health-care" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggests</a> “making all out-of-pocket medical expenses tax deductible” and “making insurance premiums paid by individuals tax deductible.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, simplicity typically isn’t appreciated in the House, as evident considering healthcare legislation that is 2,000 pages thick.</p>
