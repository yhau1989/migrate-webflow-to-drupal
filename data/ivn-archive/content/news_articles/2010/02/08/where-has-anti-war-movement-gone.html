<p>During the Bush administration, millions of anti-war protestors voiced their passionate dissent over the massive cost, in blood and treasure, of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.&nbsp; Largely composed of disaffected Democrats, the anti-war movement vigorously challenged the Bush-Cheney war policies through hundreds of well-orchestrated rallies across the nation.&nbsp; But suddenly, the movement has gone strangely silent despite President Obama's intensification of the war effort.</p><p>While President Obama campaigned as the more diplomatic, pro-peace candidate, a significant number of his policies have undermined his credibility in this arena.&nbsp; Here's an abridged list:</p><p>He just signed a record <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20100113/D9D6RFGG1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$708 billion</a> military budget, bigger than President Bush's largest defense budget.&nbsp;</p><p>He allocated over $100 billion in supplemental funding for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>The CIA has carried out a record number of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/26/091026fa_fact_mayer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predator Drone attacks</a> on targets in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other nations, attacks which led to the deaths of <a href="http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=Pakistan+%26+Sub-Continent&amp;month=January2010&amp;file=World_News2010010283910.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 700</a> Pakistani civilians last year.</p><p>He instituted two new troop surges in Afghanistan, which added an additional 50,000 troops.</p><p>His two troop surges led to 2009 being the <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/278226" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloodiest year</a> for American &amp; NATO soldiers in Afghanistan.</p><p>A record number of <a href="http://theindependentforum.blogspot.com/2009/12/private-war-contractors-reaping-huge.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">private war contractors</a>, approximately over 200,000, now operate in Afghanistan and Iraq under Obama's command.</p><p>U.S. soldiers, mainly special forces, are now operating in <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100203/ap_on_re_as/as_pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pakistan</a> and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/01/27/2010-01-27_obama_okd_special_ops_against_al_qaeda_leaders_in_yemen_report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yemen</a>.</p><p>Over 100,000 soldiers are still on the ground in Iraq, despite campaign pledges to commence a fairly rapid drawdown.&nbsp; In addition, a <a href="http://theindependentforum.blogspot.com/2010/02/5050-chance-for-iraq-civil-war.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">significant spike</a> in sectarian violence has occured in Iraq over the last six months, arousing new worries of yet another delay.</p><p>Guantanamo Bay is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/18/AR2009111800571.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">still open</a>, despite Obama's pledge to close it in a year's time.</p><p>In his proposal for a three-year federal spending freeze, the military budget was completely <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/us/politics/26budget.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">exempted</a>.</p><p>Under Obama, annual war spending now <a href="http://pubrecord.org/nation/6376/federal-spending-exceeds-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer">surpasses</a> healthcare, education, welfare, and safety spending by all fifty state governments combined.</p><p>So, despite the flowery rhetoric and promises of "change", in many ways, President Obama has instituted a more hawkish and more expensive war policy than President Bush.&nbsp; Yet, notwithstanding a strong rebuke by Michael Moore and a few rallies by Cindy Sheehan &amp; Co., the anti-war movement has offered very little resistance to the Obama administration and the Democratic-led Congress. Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow, and other liberal network personalities do not seem to be putting up much of a fight, either, compared to their complaints during the Bush-Cheney years.</p><p>Is this just a clear-cut case of partisan hypocrisy, then?</p><p>As it stands now, the most consistent anti-war opposition continues to originate from the likes of Cindy Sheehan, Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich, Independent Progressive <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2009/12/14/straight-talk-ralph-nader?quicktabs_1=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ralph Nader</a>, Republican Congressman Ron Paul,&nbsp; Democratic congressional candidate Marcy Winogard, and <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antiwar.com</a>.</p><p>Much like Republicans lost a tremendous amount of credibility on fiscal issues by exploding the national debt, Democrats are rapidly in danger of losing their credibility on war policy.&nbsp; Record war spending, multiple troop surges, an explosive rise in Drone attacks, higher casualties, and the status quo on Guantanamo Bay are some of the stains on a Democratic party that was supposed to overturn many of the previous administration's "warmongering" policies.</p><p>If the anti-war movement wants to regain its credibility, it will need to start holding President Obama accountable, just as it did President Bush.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
