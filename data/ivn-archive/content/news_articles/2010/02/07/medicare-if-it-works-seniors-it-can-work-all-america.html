<p>A couple of years ago, before my wife and I had turned 65 and become eligible for Medicare, we looked upon mail from our health insurance provider with dread wondering if our premiums had gone up again.&nbsp; We were on a group policy under my small company (2-3 employees max), and our rates were practically the same as individual coverage.&nbsp; Health insurance was a major budget item for us.&nbsp; A notice of increased premiums put us back to step one in our budgeting process because heath insurance cost us more than our monthly mortgage payment.</p><p>As a result, I felt a huge twinge of empathy (and anger) when I read a recent LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-insure-anthem5-2010feb05,0,3002094.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> which reported that Anthem Blue Cross was raising its health insurance rates as much as 39% for individual policy holders.&nbsp; Based on personal experience, I felt sure that those individuals at the high end of the increases were likely to be 60 years old and above.&nbsp; Once we reached 60, despite good health and no major (i.e., expensive) medical problems, we found it very difficult to even purchase insurance, much less pay for it.</p><p>Medicare has been the saving grace for us.&nbsp; Not only did our insurance premiums drop significantly, but our co-pays also fell by a considerable margin.&nbsp; A typical doctor visit under our standard insurance required a $40 co-pay.&nbsp; It’s free under Medicare.&nbsp; Most of our prescriptions are either free or under $10 under Medicare Part D,&nbsp; and there are no forms whatsoever. Our rates do increase a bit from year to year, but at a pace we can easily handle.&nbsp; Overall medical costs are down more than 50% and have finally stabilized for us.</p><p>To put it succinctly, Medicare has been wonderful.&nbsp; It gives us the best of single-payer simplicity despite the fact that we work directly with a private insurance carrier. It provides substantively lower prices without requiring us to change doctors.<br>What I don’t understand is why this public-private partnership can’t work for everyone, and why some people believe that extending this type of program beyond seniors signals the downfall of free-market capitalism.</p><p>Here’s how I see it:&nbsp; Medical costs were making life difficult for my family.&nbsp; Medicare solved the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical costs are making life difficult for the nation as a whole.&nbsp; Medicare for all seems like a logical, ready-made solution. The fact that Medicare is having financial difficulties is resolvable.&nbsp; In fact, I have two specific suggestions:</p><p>First, eliminate the Medicare Advantage plans, which are heavily subsidized by the government, so insurance companies can offer them at bargain prices.&nbsp; Insurance companies are making a bundle off of Medicare Advantage and market it more aggressively than the simpler and more sensible Medigap plans.</p><p>Second, get tough on drug costs.&nbsp; Negotiate on a national level with the pharmaceutical companies and force them to reduce prices.&nbsp; Wal-Mart does that with its suppliers every day, and no one is accusing Wal-Mart of undermining capitalism.</p><p>If we want to get serious about solving our health care cost issues, we should all take a page out of our seniors’ book of advice and strongly consider Medicare as a viable solution.&nbsp; A 39% increase in health insurance rates by Anthem Blue Cross cannot be ignored.</p>
