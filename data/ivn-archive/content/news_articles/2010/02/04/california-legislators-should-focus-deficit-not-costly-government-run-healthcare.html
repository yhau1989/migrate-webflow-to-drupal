<p>“If you get breast cancer, I’m sorry honey; you have less chance of survival than before this bill passed.” Those words were declared by Michigan Congressman Mike Rogers six months ago during his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44NCvNDLfc" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening statements</a> regarding health care reform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since Mr. Roger’s statement, Republican Scott Brown won a Massachusetts special election to fill Ted Kennedy’s vacant seat.&nbsp; Americans across the nation focused on the campaign in hopes that Brown would win in order to break the democrat majority needed to pass Obamacare.&nbsp; Voters sent a clear message echoed by mainstream <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/september_2009/health_care_reform" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a> that the majority of Americans oppose government controlled healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Confirming the majority sentiment, Virginia Democrat, state Senator Phillip Puckett stated, “I don't believe someone should be forced to buy something they don't want to…It’s un-American.&nbsp; And it might be unconstitutional."&nbsp; Senator Puckett joined other state senators earlier this week to pass <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-11804-Health-Care-Examiner%7Ey2010m2d2-Virginia-moves-to-make-mandatory-health-insurance-illegal" rel="noopener noreferrer">three bills</a> making it illegal to enforce mandatory healthcare onto Virginia residents.</p><p>Apparently, the California Senate Appropriations Committee does not believe universal healthcare is un-American since they passed SB 810 earlier this week.&nbsp; If signed into law, the state government-controlled bill would cost California over <a href="http://www.inlandempire.us/rss/article.php?client=redfusion&amp;id=20100203153334%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 billion</a>.</p><p>Currently, California faces a $20 billion deficit and a record 12% plus unemployment rate.&nbsp; As businesses <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/28/mass-exodus" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave the Golden State</a> in record numbers and residents struggle to pay their mortgages, the state legislature seems more concerned with abolishing <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/comments_blog/2010/02/free-parking-not-if-one-state-lawmaker-gets-his-way.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">free parking</a> than with the exorbitant cost of their proposed healthcare plan.&nbsp; Equally disturbing is the fact that the state legislature is definitely out of touch with their constituents according to the latest <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2326.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field Poll</a>.&nbsp; 7 out of 10 Californians disapproved of how the federal government handled the healthcare issue.&nbsp; Although healthcare is crucial to every citizen, no one wants to gamble with their own lives while being forced to pay for an experiment.</p><p>Individual choice is the American way!&nbsp; Freedom is the main principle our nation was founded upon.&nbsp; Indeed our healthcare system needs reforming but through the private sector and personal choices.&nbsp; Health prevention and natural medicine resources are readily available and cost efficient.&nbsp; In fact, educational <a href="http://healthfreedomexpo.com/expo/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">health expos</a> are <a href="http://2010conference.livefreenow.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">common</a> in California.</p><p>Instead of playing medical professionals, our elected officials should spend more time listening to voters and reducing our state deficit. Perhaps what is truly in order is a part time legislature to cure an out-of-touch state government.</p>
