<p>Long before the Tea Party movement sprang up in the early days of President Obama, the liberty movement was catching fire.&nbsp; Dedicated to a pro-constitution, fiscally conservative, and anti-war GOP presidential candidate, the liberty movement barnstormed the nation with an explosion of grassroots enthusiasm.&nbsp; When Texas Congressman, Dr. Ron Paul, challenged the GOP establishment in 2007-2008, tens of thousands of supporters organized record breaking, one-day "money bombs", catchy YouTube videos, massive sign waving events, and even a blimp, without any assistance from special interests, party elites, or network celebrities.</p><p> </p><p>Then, in early 2009, a few weeks after Obama's inauguration, the Tea Party movement began to show its head,&nbsp;enflamed by the&nbsp;bailouts and&nbsp;record government spending.&nbsp; Little did many people realize, however, that the "Tea Party" concept originated in December 2007, when over 58,000 grassroots supporters donated a <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20071216005059&amp;newsLang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-day record of $6 million</a> to Dr. Paul's presidential campaign on the anniversary of the original 1773 Boston Tea Party.</p><p> </p><p>As the Tea Party began to slowly emerge, the "Liberty movement" was already in full swing.&nbsp; Dr. Paul had inspired a whole slate of grassroots candidates to launch campaigns for the 2010 elections.&nbsp; Candidates such Dr. Rand Paul (his son), Peter Schiff, Adam Kokesh, RJ Harris, John Dennis, Jake Towne, and Debra Medina began gearing up to run for various offices.&nbsp; And as the Tea Party rallies began to spread throughout the nation in 2009, many of these candidates were invited to give speeches and make appearances at Tea Party events.</p><p> </p><p>But, as the Tea Party movement began to unfold, a troubling phenomenon started to emerge.&nbsp; Fox News, GOP elites, network personalities, and powerful special interests began to slowly, but insidiously take the reins.&nbsp; Seeing their opportunity, <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/11/30/tea-party-co-founder-blasts-mainstream-gop-imitators" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOP strategists</a> began to exploit the budding grassroots movement for their own political gain.&nbsp; Suddenly, the movement became obsessed with excorciating the Democrats and President Obama,&nbsp;when, in fact,&nbsp;the "shredding of&nbsp;the Consitution" by President Bush and a largely Republican Congress is what inspired the earliest tea party supporters in 2007 &amp; 2008.&nbsp; As a result, disaffected Democrats and open-minded Independents strongly rejected the Tea Party's partisan invective.</p><p> </p><p>Now, the Tea Party movement is <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/29/tea-party-movement-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer">battling for its soul</a>.&nbsp; With $100,000 payments to Sarah Palin, $500 tickets to attend a "grassroots" convention, and Republican strategists such as <a href="http://newsblaze.com/story/20100101012534nnnn.nb/topstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sal Russo</a> pulling the strings behind the scenes, the Tea Party movement is fighting the onslaught of a full-fledged, GOP establishment hijacking.</p><p> </p><p>But, strangely enough, so is the Liberty movement.</p><p> </p><p>Recently, Dr. Rand Paul, who is <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/71712/rand-paul-frontrunner-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">dominating</a> the polls in the US Senate race in Kentucky, received an official <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/32337.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsement</a> from Sarah Palin.&nbsp; Months earlier, he had stated that his campaign was "<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/11/12/qa-with-rand-paul-shaking-up-the-kentucky-senate-race/tab/article/" rel="noopener noreferrer">making overtures</a>" to gain her support.&nbsp; Since the endorsement, Rand has showered Palin with <a href="http://www.randpaul2010.com/2010/02/sarah-palin-endorses/" rel="noopener noreferrer">glowing praise</a>, even though some feel their economic and foreign policy views significantly differ in certain areas.</p><p> </p><p>Without a doubt, Palin is a prominent figure in the political world, and her endorsement may have just sealed the deal for a Paul victory in the GOP primary.&nbsp; However, in the general election, when one has to face independent and democratic voters, it may be more difficult to pitch his message considering her <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/16/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5674379.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">low poll numbers</a> with these segments of the electorate.&nbsp; Also, Palin is <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=56538&amp;tsp=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">stumping</a> for the Tea Party Express, which is headed by Sal Russo. Russo is a long-time Republican consultant who played a role in efforts such as the Gray Davis <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/2003-02-20/news/taking-down-gray" rel="noopener noreferrer">recall campaign</a> in California, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth against Kerry, and the <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2005/12/28/pro-war-group-takes-to-the-airwaves/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-war lobbying group</a> that built political support for the Iraq war.&nbsp; One <span>wonders if Rand has truly weighed the potential consequences of an expedient political union with Palin.<br></span></p><p> </p><p>Some supporters, however, claim that Palin's endorsement is really an endorsement of the liberty movement's promising potential and rock solid platform.&nbsp; They claim that such a high-profile endorsement is clear-cut evidence of the GOP finally kowtowing to the "Ron Paul Revolution".&nbsp; Some claim that Rand's unqualified acceptance of Palin's endorsement is a political necessity and a pragmatic reality.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>While these claims are quite reasonable, even politically astute, they appear to fly in the face of the liberty movement's support of Dr. Ron Paul in its nascent stages.&nbsp;Unlike Rand Paul's seemingly "anti-liberty" stance on Guantanamo Bay, Dr. Ron Paul never compromised with the GOP establishment on foreign policy, civil liberties, fiscal &amp; monetary policy.&nbsp; Dr. Ron Paul refused to endorse John McCain, instead choosing to promote <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/ron-paul-makes-an-appeal-for-third-party-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">third party candidates</a> as a more change-oriented alternative.&nbsp; And yet, despite Ron's open defiance and overt criticism of the GOP, he has somehow managed to get re-elected and spark a powerful, well-funded political movement in 2010.</p><p> </p><p>Lately, though, even Ron Paul has not been the GOP renegade.&nbsp; Dr. Paul has <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/node/121785" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to support</a> Texas GOP incumbents in the 2010 elections, even though some of them hold positions and have cast votes that Dr. Paul has staunchly opposed.&nbsp; Though it is unclear as to why Dr. Paul is supporting this effort, a whole variety of speculative justifications have been offered.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Are these warning signs of compromise with the GOP establishment? What first emerged as a scathing refutation of the party machine, now appears to be an operation of ever increasing compromise.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>To be fair, though, was this merely an inevitability?&nbsp; Are the two-party machines, at this time, still too strong, too dominant to reject completely?&nbsp; Has the Liberty Movement, like the Tea Party movement, sacrificed legitimate, long-term reform for short-term gain?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, like the Tea Party movement, is the Liberty movement just experiencing the typical&nbsp;internal debate?</p><p> </p><p>Time will tell, but in the meantime, readers are encouraged to keep a close eye on this budding movement, and whether or not it can withstand the pressure and enticements of the GOP establishment.</p>
