<p>Fox News lightning rod, Bill O'Reilly, criticized Republicans and Democrats in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulus.&nbsp; Claiming that each side possesses a valid concern in the healthcare debate, O'Reilly urged both parties to reject partisanship and craft a plan that addresses the real needs of average Americans, though he doubts that will actually happen.&nbsp; He also called out the "loons" on both sides of the political aisle and directed a few critical remarks toward Democrats Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid, as well as Republicans Sarah Palin and John Boehner.</p><p>Finally, Stephanopoulus remarked that O'Reilly sounded an awful lot like Ross Perot and asked O'Reilly if he'd consider an independent bid in 2012.&nbsp; O'Reilly largely dismissed the notion, claiming that he has more power and freedom doing what he's doing now.</p><p>So, what do you think?&nbsp;</p><p>Would Bill O'Reilly be a viable, Independent candidate in 2012 if by chance he chose to run?&nbsp; Or, is he just a "partisan wolf in independent's clothing?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Editor's note:&nbsp; To view the interview, click <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2010/02/oreilly-for-president-i-mave-more-power-doing-what-im-doing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
