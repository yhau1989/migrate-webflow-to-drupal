<p>Many in this nation are growing increasingly concerned about the national debt and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp; As a result, CAIVN would like to share a portion of Marcy Winograd's recent press release in order to stimulate debate and discussion.&nbsp; Here is the abridged version:</p><p><span>"Now, more than ever before, we need  progressives in Congress who will challenge bloated military budgets<span> </span>which bleed our treasury of  money better spent on jobs in mass transit, renewable energy,  infrastructure repair, education, and health care.&nbsp; A 2007 University of  Massachusetts study stated that a billion dollars spent on  transportation would result in twice the number of jobs than if it were  spent on military contracting.</span></p><p><span><br><br>The proposed new military budget<span>&nbsp;</span> is nearly  $1 trillion, with Pentagon spending of $800 billion, including a  30-billion supplemental to escalate the war in Afghanistan<span>&nbsp;</span>. On top of that, add  secret black hole prisons; military aid<span>&nbsp;</span> to foreign nations, and money for mercenaries.</span></p><p><span><br><br><strong>Worse,  to pay for all of this, we must borrow from China<span></span> and Japan.</strong></span></p><p><span><strong></strong><br><br>America  is addicted to war and to debt.&nbsp; It's time to break the addiction --  and to vote the enablers out."</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>So, what do you think?&nbsp; Is Winograd spot on in her analysis, or way off base?<br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p>
