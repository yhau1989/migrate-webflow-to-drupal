<p>Earlier this week I was reading AB 347, a bill that is currently circulating in Washington DC. The summary reads as follows:&nbsp; "Allows an individual or a corporate taxpayer to deduct a charitable contribution made for the relief of victims of the earthquake in Haiti on the taxpayer's 2009 tax return, instead of the 2010 tax return."</p><p>I am a supporter of charitable giving.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I am the president of a non-profit corporation.&nbsp; However, playing with taxes in this manner is, in my opinion, playing with fire.&nbsp; Our nation already operates under a budget that is out of step with reality.&nbsp; We have existing tax laws for charitable donations.&nbsp; Does <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0301-0350/ab_347_cfa_20100127_152919_asm_floor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">this bill</a> serve any purpose other than to make the person(s) sponsoring it "look good" in an election year?&nbsp; I donâ€™t think so.</p><p><br><br>The current tax code is hundreds of pages long and wastes $200 billion a year on <a href="http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-it68.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax code compliance</a>.&nbsp; Now we're going to spend additional tax dollars on getting a jump-start on 2010 donations?</p><p><br><br>Where in the Constitution is the authority to offer aid to foreign nations though manipulations of US tax code derived?&nbsp; Is it altruism if your motivation is the manipulation of a tax return?&nbsp; How does it benefit all citizens as "fair and honest taxation"?&nbsp; How would this bill improve the "general welfare" of the United States?&nbsp; How does this bill address the already out-of-control deficit?&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>How about we set up a tax bill that will offer deductions to people who donate to "reduce the deficit" this year?&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>Does Haiti need our help? Yes.&nbsp; That fact is unquestionable.&nbsp; However, we should not be manipulating our tax code to provide that aid.&nbsp; Millions of dollars are flowing into Haiti regardless of this bill.&nbsp; It boils down to more pointless legislation.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>When Congress uses its power to change existing tax codes in order to boost re-election campaigns and popularity (in the name of altruism), suddenly changes to the financial structure of our nation are based on whim - not law.&nbsp; With precedents such as this, what is to stop Congress from passing a change to the tax code, which will exempt them from paying taxes altogether?</p><p><br><br>I urge you to contact your Congressional representatives and suggest they spend their time and energy fixing what we have first.</p>
