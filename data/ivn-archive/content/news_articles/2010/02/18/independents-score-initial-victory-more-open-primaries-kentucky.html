<p>Fed up with the two-party system, independents scored a huge victory for more open primaries in the Kentucky state senate.&nbsp; Despite strong opposition from Democrats, the Kentucky Senate voted to allow registered independents the opportunity to participate in the primary elections.&nbsp; The vote moves to the Kentucky House where Democrats comprise a majority, putting passage in jeopardy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independentkentucky.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Kentucky</a>, a grassroots nonpartisan organization, is leading the growing effort to allow the tens of thousands of registered independents a voice in the primary elections.&nbsp; If the bill somehow passes the Kentucky House, independent voters could participate for the first time, though they would have to request a partisan ballot in a <a href="http://www.independentkentucky.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15:cnn-story-on-independent-kentucky&amp;catid=8:media-event-idky-cat" rel="noopener noreferrer">semi-open primary</a> model.&nbsp; Partisan opposition is adamant that the current two-party system is the purest form of American democracy and should not be altered to placate those individuals who refuse to participate in the dominant, electoral model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In California, an independent-led grassroots movement is attempting to secure a Top Two Open Primary in which 'Decline to State' voters would be allowed to participate in the primary process, without having to cast a partisan ballot.&nbsp; The <a href="http://caivn.org/issue/open-primary-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer">open primary initiative</a> will appear on the June ballot and is already stirring up heated debate (see <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/15/evan-bayh-good-bye-congress-and-your-partisan-politics-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/07/california-blanket-primary-election-results-challenge-top-two-open-primary-claim" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With independents comprising slightly over 20% of the California electorate and over 30% of the national electorate, the push toward open primaries looks poised to intensify as more and more disaffected voters express their frustration at the ineffectiveness of the two-party system.&nbsp; Tired of divisive partisanship and poor performance, independents are looking to play a more pivotal role in state and national politics, and their initial victory in the state of Kentucky proves they're a force to be reckoned with.</p>
