<p>President Obama signed a one-year extension of several key provisions of the Patriot Act.&nbsp; Obama's signature follows passage in both the House and Senate, as CAIVN contributor, Thomas Sbrega, <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/26/patriot-act-extension-passes-house-and-senate" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> on Friday.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Bush administration and a Republican-led Congress, there was heated debate over the constitutionality of the Patriot Act, but now, there seems to be minimal media coverage or political debate in the public arena.&nbsp; Many had hoped that Obama would abandon much of the previous administration's security practices, but it appears that Obama, much like his record military budget, is following the Bush doctrine on the 'War on Terror'.</p><p>So, what do you think about Obama's decision to <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20100228/D9E4T02G0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">extend</a> the Patriot Act?&nbsp;</p><p>Do you think Obama is doing what is necessary to keep America safe?&nbsp; Or, do you think he's abandoning his promise of change?</p>
