<p>Everyone is worried about the skyrocketing national debt, yet no one wants to cut spending. Both Republicans and Democrats warn of a national debt crisis just over the horizon, yet both parties continue to spend <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/18/partisan-gridlock-leading-national-debt-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer">record amounts</a> on the military and domestic entitlements.&nbsp; China, formerly our biggest creditor, is slowly beginning to dump US bonds as it grows increasingly concerned with America's profligate policies.</p><p>Now, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the latest DC figure head to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2511749320100225" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk a big game</a>.&nbsp; Substantively, she is spot on.&nbsp; Our $14 trillion debt is undoubtedly a grave national security threat, but in classic government double speak, she has requested $5 billion more for her foreign policy department.&nbsp; She offers the usual creative explanations, but in the end, no matter how one spins it, it's an increase, and it's part and parcel of Obama's <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/08/where-has-anti-war-movement-gone" rel="noopener noreferrer">record</a> "defense" budget.</p><p>As long as Republicans and Democrats continue this charade, a debt explosion of monumental proportions is a virtual certainty.&nbsp; Whether it comes in 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years is immaterial.&nbsp; Our course must be reversed before it's too late.&nbsp; At some point, spending must be cut, and it must be cut across the board.&nbsp; Policing the world, fighting open-ended wars, bailing out banks and car companies, passing repeated "stimulus" bills, and spending endless amounts on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are unsustainable, not 5 years from now, but right now.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no need to create a new government commission to analyze the deficit and national debt.&nbsp; It's pretty simple.&nbsp; Cut spending, and cut it everywhere.&nbsp; It's common sense.&nbsp; And yes, it will hurt bad in the near term, really, really bad, but we are a tough nation.&nbsp; We can handle it for the sake of our families, friends, children, and grand-children.&nbsp; We got through the Great Depression.&nbsp; We got through World War II.&nbsp; We got through 9/11.&nbsp;</p><p>We can get through this too, if we want it bad enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
