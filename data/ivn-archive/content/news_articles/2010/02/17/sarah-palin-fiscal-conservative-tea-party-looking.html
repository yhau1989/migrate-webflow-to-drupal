<p>Sarah Palin has emerged as the unofficial leader of a national movement that is championing limited government, lower taxes, and less debt.&nbsp; While Palin espouses a fiscally conservative platform, it would behoove supporters to test her platform against her record as a mayor, governor, vice presidential candidate, and grassroots celebrity.</p><p>As a mayor, Palin cut property taxes by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin#Mayor_of_Wasilla" rel="noopener noreferrer">75%</a>, eliminated the business inventory tax, and cut her own salary by 10%.&nbsp; However, during her term, the sales tax rose by 0.5% and public works spending projects increased the city's debt by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin#Mayor_of_Wasilla" rel="noopener noreferrer">$24 million</a>.&nbsp; She also lobbied for nearly $8 million in federal earmarks.&nbsp;</p><p>As a governor, Palin <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/08/29/palin-uninspiring-tax-policy-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer">repealed</a> tire taxes, issued tax credits for commercial salmon fishing and film production, implemented a one-year suspension of the state fuel tax, and reduced the state's business license fee.&nbsp; She also sold the state jet, refused to use the gubernatorial chef &amp; personal driver, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin#Budget.2C_spending.2C_and_federal_funds" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected</a> a pay raise, and vetoed hundreds of millions of dollars in extra spending projects.&nbsp; She also socked away <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/1217049,palin101208.article" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 billion</a> for a rainy day.&nbsp; However, she also signed a record budget which increased spending by 28%, raised taxes on oil companies, requested about $200 million in federal earmarks (though far less than her predecessor), and kept about $440 million in federal transportation funds originally allocated for the "Bridge to Nowhere".</p><p>As a vice-presidential candidate, Palin supported John McCain, whom the National Taxpayers Union <a href="http://www.ntu.org/main/page.php?PageID=141" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> would've increased federal spending, perpetuating the Bush administration's chronic budget deficits.&nbsp; Palin also <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201002070013" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> the $700 billion Wall St bailout.</p><p>As a "grassroots" leader and Tea Party icon, she has trumpeted former President Ronald Reagan as a champion of fiscal conservatism in her book <em>Going Rogue</em>.&nbsp; But, as I outlined in a previous <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/02/01/challenging-glenn-becks-conservative-icons" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>, Reagan increased both domestic and overseas spending, was unable to balance the budget, and doubled the national debt, despite a largely Republican Senate.&nbsp; In addition, she is campaigning for John McCain, even though she called him a "progressive" who supported the bank bailout (which she supported in 2008) in a recent Glenn Beck <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201002070013" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>.&nbsp; She has also expressed her support for <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTI5NzBmYThkM2M5MDI4NThiMDQwNGU1NmRkMzMxMDE=" rel="noopener noreferrer">attacking Iran</a>, which by all accounts, would certainly add to the $1.4 trillion budget deficit, much like the $1 trillion wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>So, when it comes to fiscal conservatism, Palin's track record is best described as a mixed bag.&nbsp; At times, she has enacted strong, fiscally conservative policies, while at other times, she has implemented and/or supported fiscally liberal policies.&nbsp; In other words, Sarah Palin's experience, campaigning, and commentating strongly suggest that she can at most be considered a fiscal moderate.</p><p>Therefore, tea party supporters should ask themselves, based on the actual data, if they are supporting Palin because she is a staunch fiscal conservative, or if she is merely a charismatic, symbolic counter to President Obama and Democratic leadership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
