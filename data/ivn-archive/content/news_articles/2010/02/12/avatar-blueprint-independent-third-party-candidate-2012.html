<p>Avatar's pro-environment, anti-war ideology has been thoroughly scrutinized by political pundits on both sides of the aisle.&nbsp; One aspect of their critical analysis that has been missing, however, is the prospect of an Avatar-type, 3rd party candidate in 2012.&nbsp; At first glance, such a proposition may seem implausible, even repugnant to the Right, but it may not be as far fetched as some believe.</p><p><br><br>As I covered in my December piece <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/31/2nd-american-revolution-its-way" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is the Second American Revolution on its way?</a>, one leading trends forecaster has predicted the rise of a viable third party by 2012.&nbsp; At this early stage, he is identifying the prospective party as "Progressive Libertarian".&nbsp; A seemingly odd couple, the progressive component, he posits, will advocate a platform of clean food, top notch healthcare, high quality education, green technology and anti-war principles.&nbsp; The libertarian component, on the other hand, will advocate a platform of strict fiscal conservatism, civil liberties, states' rights, and a more non-interventionist foreign policy.</p><p><br><br>Most would deem such a scenario highly improbable, even out of touch with mainstream America, but consider the "mainstream" track record in the last decade:</p><p><br><br>Monolithic budget deficits</p><p><br>Exploding national debt</p><p><br>A much weaker US Dollar</p><p><br>$1 trillion+ open-ended, overseas wars</p><p><br>5,000+ US troop deaths</p><p><br>Approximately 40,000 maimed US soldiers</p><p><br>Record suicide rates and an intensifying PTSD epidemic in the US military</p><p><br>Record number of private war contractors</p><p><br>Strong financial dependence on China (about a $1 trillion debt)</p><p><br>No healthcare reform</p><p><br>Underperforming education, despite more spending</p><p><br>Rising healthcare costs that could leave Medicare Part D insolvent by 2017</p><p><br>Two recessions, the latter of which has been devastating</p><p><br>Rapidly rising obesity rates</p><p><br>No climate change reform</p><p><br>No immigration reform</p><p><br><br>Clearly, both major parties have proven unsuccessful in steering this nation toward greener pastures over the last ten years.&nbsp; Whether it's a Democratic President, Republican President, Republican Congress, or Democratic Congress, America is not prospering.&nbsp; In fact, it is trending in the opposite direction.</p><p><br><br>In addition, American politics has become increasingly polarized.&nbsp; George W. Bush left a nation deeply divided, and Obama has been the <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/27/year-later-nation-polarized-partisanship" rel="noopener noreferrer">most polarizing</a> first-year President on record.&nbsp; And while the Tea Party movement may be a force to be reckoned with in the near term, all signs point to it being assimilated by the GOP.</p><p><br><br>So, imagine for a moment, an Avatar-type, independent, 3rd party candidate in 2012.</p><p><br><br>He/She proposes something long forgotten by Washington DC and the American public:&nbsp; a balanced budget.&nbsp; In this budget, he/she focuses on domestic spending that addresses infrastructure, healthcare, education, the environment, manufacturing, and better quality food.&nbsp; On the foreign policy front, he/she focuses on a more efficient national defense, while ending the current policy of pre-emptive 'wars', nation building, and a global military empire.&nbsp; Not everyone is pleased with the specifics, but most everyone is thrilled with less debt and a balanced budget.&nbsp; Both the economy and the nation begin to heal.&nbsp; The foundation for a genuine, long-term recovery is finally laid.</p><p><br><br>If America is still bogged down overseas, running trillion dollar deficits, and mired in high unemployment by 2012, look for an Avatar-type candidate to emerge and make a serious run.</p>
