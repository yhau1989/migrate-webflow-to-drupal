<p>First, it was GOP victories in the gubernatorial elections of Virginia and New Jersey.&nbsp; Just last month, it was the senatorial election of Scott Brown who claimed a historic Republican victory in the bluest of blue states, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Finally, it was Sarah Palin speaking before the Tea Party convention in Tennessee, claiming the time had come for a revolution and that the GOP would be ready to deliver this revolution to the people.&nbsp; With these electoral victories and Palin’s efforts to consolidate the Tea Party movement behind the GOP, it appears that conservatives have political momentum on their side.&nbsp; It’s been speculated that this newfound popularity is merely a temporary symptom of "political public influenza".&nbsp; Or, even more extreme, that Americans are undergoing a national ideological shift towards the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; While these theories have yet to been proven, one trend is far less ambiguous.&nbsp; Independents' numbers are rapidly growing, and the GOP has morphed its political agenda to appeal to these moderate voters.</p><p><br>2009 was supposed to be the year of the Democrats.&nbsp; The substantial electoral victories in 2008, in which the Democrats took control of both the legislative and executive branches of government, pointed toward a legislative year where they would be able to move their agenda forward without much opposition from the GOP.&nbsp; However, much has changed since the '08 elections.&nbsp; The Democrats' fairy tale has been met with a "Big Bad Witch", and it’s come in the form of an immobile and immutable GOP.&nbsp; Obama and his fellow Democrats have been met with harsh criticism focused on over-spending and the national debt, partisan health care reform, and his “lax” policies on terrorism.&nbsp; All of these issues have been compounded by a jobless economic recovery.</p><p><br>The GOP claims to have taken advantage of the missteps in Democratic policy decisions.&nbsp; Their recent victories in Democratic strongholds seem to suggest their momentum is a product of a larger movement toward traditional Republican ideals of small government and free enterprise.&nbsp; Though these events and public rhetoric certainly seem to demonstrate this shift, the numbers actually suggest the opposite.</p><p><br>According to a recent <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/125450/party-affiliation-despite-gop-gains-states-remain-blue.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup Poll</a> summarizing data from 2009, the majority of Americans remain democratic.&nbsp; The number of Americans who claim to be Democrats or lean democratic is 49%, while the figure claiming to lean Republican is 40.7%.&nbsp; Though there have been minor gains in the number of people claiming to side with Republicans, the democratic majority remains dominant.&nbsp; This minor fluctuation in party popularity shouldn’t be looked at as something new.&nbsp; Rather, history has told us that during times of economic and political strife, the public often abandons the party in power for the other party.&nbsp; Reagan, both Bush’s, and Clinton all suffered from stints of public disapproval, marked by minor growth in the popularity of the minority party.&nbsp; Thus, the recent GOP gains should be viewed with moderate speculation, as it is likely that they are not a product of a larger conservative movement, but actually a temporary readjustment common in the democratic cycle.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Contrary to what conservatives might say, the recent victories of the GOP might have more to do with the growth of unhappy Independents rather than a national shift toward more conservative ideologies.&nbsp; As political posturing and partisan finger pointing have come front and center, disenfranchised Americans have begun to separate themselves from these parties with increasing numbers.&nbsp; According to a recent CNN <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPdxhbfprQw" rel="noopener noreferrer">national poll</a>, 42% of the people surveyed identified themselves as Independents.&nbsp; Of the 42% who claimed to be Independent, 32% most often sided with Democrats, while 26% shared more common ground with Republicans.&nbsp;</p><p><br>So, while Democrats appear to have a stronger majority and more solid Independent base, the GOP is still winning elections. What gives?</p><p><br>It is not a coincidence that Scott Brown is relatively liberal when it comes to social issues, nor is it a coincidence that he referred to himself as Independent more often than not throughout his campaign.&nbsp; Republicans have realized the power of the Independent voter and have changed their campaign platforms to get their candidates elected.&nbsp; With Scott Brown’s success, the GOP has followed suit in Illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their strategy of appealing to Independents is actively being employed in the race for President Obama’s vacated Senate seat.&nbsp; In what is a relatively strong Democratic urban region, the GOP has thrown its support behind Republican <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-04/republican-leads-race-for-obama-u-s-senate-seat-poll-finds.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Kirk</a>.&nbsp; Like Brown, Mark Kirk has been coined a liberal Republican because of his Pro-Choice&nbsp; stance&nbsp; on abortion and a backing from interest groups like Planned Parenthood.&nbsp; These examples represent something significant; the nation has not undergone a spontaneous shift towards the right, but rather the GOP has moved towards the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>As the growth of the Independent movement continues, Democrats will be confronted with an ultimatum; either alter their political agenda to focus on the Independent voter or suffer more embarrassing defeats at the hands of a transforming Republican party.</p>
