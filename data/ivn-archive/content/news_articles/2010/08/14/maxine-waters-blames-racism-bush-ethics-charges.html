I think about now, or recently, about eight members of the congressional black caucus are being investigated and I think more to come. So people are raising questions about that."</p></blockquote><p>In a news comedy routine earlier this month, Jon Stewart quipped that the "race card's" account has been overdrawn- that this issue is clearly about corruption and ethics violations, not race.</p><p>In addition to attributing the investigations to racism, Waters has more recently blamed former President George W. Bush for her ethics charges, saying that she had to help out the minority-owned bank because Bush had not brokered a meeting between the bank and his top administration officials during his tenure as president:</p><blockquote><p>"The question at this point should not be why I called Secretary  Paulson, but why I had to. The question at this point should be why a trade association representing over 100 minority banks could not get a meeting at the height of the crisis."</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, investigative journalist James O'Keefe- notorious for exposing malfeasance in ACORN leading to its defunding by Congress- has published <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS1-pIFigiE" rel="noopener noreferrer">a preview video</a> to <em>YouTube</em> of his next upcoming piece.</p><p>After showing multiple clips of past stories, the caption "...WHO WILL BE NEXT?" appears, followed by footage of Congresswoman Waters talking about her bank and real estate.</p>
