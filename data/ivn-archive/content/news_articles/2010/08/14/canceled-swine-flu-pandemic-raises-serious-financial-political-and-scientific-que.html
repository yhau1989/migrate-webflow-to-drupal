This money has funded vaccination programs even after many European legislators repeatedly claimed the WHO was overstating the severity of Swine Flu to boost pharmaceutical profit.&nbsp; Taxpayers shouldered the brunt of the financial burden as billions of dollars have been spent by governments to purchase vaccines, most of which have <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=623794" rel="noopener noreferrer">gone to waste</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But, skeptics of the Swine Flu scare are asking why WHO officials declared a level six pandemic last June when <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027776_swine_flu_propaganda.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">questions arose</a> about the high likelihood of unverified diagnoses, with many doctors misreporting common flu symptoms as being caused by the H1N1 strain.&nbsp;</p><p>A leading health expert in Europe went on record in January stating that H1N1 was part of a “false pandemic.” Wolfgang Wodarg, head of health at the <em>Council of Europe</em>, claimed major drug companies fomented a "campaign of panic" to pressure the WHO into declaring a pandemic.&nbsp; It turns out that the very same experts who pushed to raise the pandemic alarm have <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028936_WHO_vaccines.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">close financial ties</a> to the pharmaceutical and vaccine companies who made <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60E1SU20100115?type=marketsNews" rel="noopener noreferrer">windfall profits</a> from the disease.<br>“It all has the makings of a&nbsp;grand global con,” writes Mike Adams of <em>NaturalNews.com</em>. He continues:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The WHO enlists advisors with financial ties to the vaccine&nbsp;industry&nbsp;to decide whether a pandemic is under way and then conveniently follows their advice in making a decision that many&nbsp;health&nbsp;experts around the world have been questioning from the start.”&nbsp;</p><p>Chan claims that declaring Swine Flu a pandemic was “the right call” because the international health rules governing outbreaks only take into account the geographic distribution of a disease. However, officials at WHO are willing to revise the definition of a pandemic to take the severity of diseases into account as well, says Chan.&nbsp;</p><p>That may be, but Adams contends that the WHO’s credibility is irreparably damaged. “It all has the appearance of&nbsp;medical corruption, and it looks like WHO decisions are based more on&nbsp;politics&nbsp;than medical science,” he writes.</p>
