So we are going to fight for every vote," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Latinos have called Whitman out for her shifting stances on immigration, bringing her past ads and rhetoric to account.&nbsp; Among these is a past campaign ad that Whitman released of her alongside Pete Wilson, the very face of the controversial Proposition 187.&nbsp; It was in that ad that Whitman proclaimed she would not be soft on illegal immigration and sanctuary cities.&nbsp; "Meg will be tough as nails on illegal immigration. She'll fight to secure our border and go after sanctuary cities," it said that particular ad.&nbsp;</p><p>Union members are among the most active in opposing Whitman in her current Latino outreach.&nbsp; Her Democratic opponent Jerry Brown is also jumping on his Republican rival.&nbsp; "Meg Whitman has been telling one story in English, and a different story in Spanish. It's no surprise that California's Latino voters are rejecting her cynical lies," he said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Prominent Democrats at the state legislative level have sought to use their influence to make sure that Whitman, according to their belief, doesn’t lead Hispanics astray.&nbsp; One of those is Gil Cedillo, chairman of the <em>Latino Legislative Caucus of California</em>.&nbsp; “Unfortunately, [Wilson] is not well received in the Latino community, especially by those who were politically active during that time period," he said concerning Whitman’s ties to the former Prop 187 governor.&nbsp;</p><p>In July of this year, Rep. U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra, (D-Los Angeles) said that Jerry Brown has more credibility with the Hispanics since it was Brown who worked alongside Hispanic farmers.&nbsp; <br><br>Whitman has talked tough on illegal immigration and sanctuary cities, but has also said that she would not adopt an Arizona law for California.&nbsp; As a result, a host of one of the most widely listened to talk radio stations in Los  Angeles pressed Whitman over her <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=69375" rel="noopener noreferrer">shifting positions on immigration</a>.</p><p>Whitman’s strategy can be interpreted in such a way that she understands the need to appeal to the broadest possible electorate, especially in California. And her aggressive Hispanic opposition might show that she presents a threat in splitting the Hispanic vote.&nbsp; Or, she might just be seen as another pandering politician.<br><br>A <em>Field Poll</em> in July showed that Whitman and Brown were tied in taking the Hispanic vote.</p>
