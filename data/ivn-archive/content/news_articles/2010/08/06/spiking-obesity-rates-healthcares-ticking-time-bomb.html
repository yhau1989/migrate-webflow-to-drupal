Even more startling is the fact that not a single state was below the 15% obesity threshold, which is the <a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy People 2010</a> goal.&nbsp;</p><p>A more detailed breakdown revealed that the obesity rate for Blacks was 36.8%, while Hispanics registered in at 30.7%.&nbsp; Those without a high school education yielded a 32.9% obesity rate.&nbsp; Regionally, the South came in at 28.4% with the Midwest a close second at 28.2%.&nbsp; "Obesity continues to be a major public health program," said CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, "We need intensive, comprehensive, and ongoing efforts to treat obesity..."&nbsp;</p><p>Predictably, rising obesity rates are significantly increasing healthcare costs.&nbsp; Susan Brady, at <a href="http://www.healthnews.com/family-health/obesity-in-america-new-cdc-report-is-grim-reminder-4388.html?page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">HealthNews</a>, wrote that healthcare costs related to obesity are estimated to be $147 billion, while obese individuals spent on average $1,429 more on medical costs compared to normal weight individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>While healthcare reform debate has almost exclusively centered on the role of the federal government, $1 trillion plans, competition across state lines, access, and cost control measures, the obesity epidemic has received relatively modest attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Sedentary lifestyles, nutrient-poor, fat-laden processed foods, a reliance upon prescription drugs, and a lack of sufficient dietary education are often identified as contributing factors to the rapidly developing health crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Unless this trend is quickly reversed, America may be looking at an economic and health disaster of epic proportions in the near future.</p>
