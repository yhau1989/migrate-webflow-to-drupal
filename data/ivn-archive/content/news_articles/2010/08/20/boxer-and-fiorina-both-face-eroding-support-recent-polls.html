<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gps-system-wrong-direction-2.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://gps-system-wrong-direction-2.jpg" title="Boxer and Fiorina both face eroding support in recent polls" width="300"></a></p><p>The most striking aspect of the Boxer-Fiorina Senatorial campaign is how much ground both candidates are losing.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/ca/california_senate_boxer_vs_fiorina-1094.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a>, which summarizes all active polls, both candidates have experienced an oddly similar drop in support over the past month.&nbsp; Boxer remains in the lead in this contest, but the difference between the candidates is so minimal that the race is considered a toss-up by most pundits.&nbsp; According to the analysis by <em>Real Clear Politics</em>, “As of August, there’s a real chance that Boxer will lose this one.”&nbsp;</p><p>Both candidates have lost around three percent of their support over the past month.&nbsp; At her high point, Fiorina was polling 43.5 percent of the voters.&nbsp; She’s now at 40.3 percent.&nbsp; Boxer has dropped from 47 to 43.8 percent over this same period.&nbsp;</p><p>The similarity between the two charts is surprising.&nbsp; Up until now, polls have reflected a zero sum game for the candidates in which increasing support for one meant decreasing support for the others.&nbsp; Thus, the charts have been mirror images since polling on this race began at the end of January. And while this month’s pattern may only be a temporary glitch in the numbers, it could also mean that Californians are fed up with the mindless partisanship so rampant in California and across the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>As David Broder pointed out in a recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/18/AR2010081804692.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post column</a>, the choice between Democrats and Republicans has become unappealing:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Democrats seem determined to teach us the price of vacillation, while the Republicans are bent on instructing us on the rewards of obstruction. What a helluva choice awaits in the November election.”&nbsp;</p><p>Broder cites the president’s wavering on his support of the Islamic Center and Mosque near Ground Zero as a prime example of the Democrats’ vacillation.&nbsp; Then he describes the Republicans’ mindless opposition to sensible and important White House initiatives such as the new START treaty with Russia.&nbsp; As the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/16/AR2010081605422.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post noted</a> this week, delaying tactics by Republicans on START have meant that:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “[f]or the first time in 15 years, U.S. officials have lost their ability to inspect Russian long-range nuclear bases, where they had become accustomed to peering into missile silos, counting warheads and whipping out tape measures to size up rockets.”&nbsp;</p><p>Is it possible that the downturn in support for both Boxer and Fiorina is the beginning of voter recognition that the U.S. Senate is in a quagmire which both of these candidates seem determined to prolong?&nbsp; Or is it simply a case of voters responding to both candidates’ negative campaigning by taking a “none of the above” attitude?&nbsp;</p><p>Fiorina is largely a cipher as a politician; and while she’s better known as a business leader, she does not come with the cache of a highly successful CEO such as Meg Whitman.&nbsp; Boxer has long been thought of as a lightweight, especially when compared to California’s highly respected senior Senator, Dianne Feinstein.&nbsp; Boxer seems mired in her liberal perspective on the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The question for voters is, would Fiorina simply go the other way and choose rigid obstructionism to all and any Democratic ideas?&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the simultaneous loss of support for both candidates may be nothing more than a case of voters coming to their senses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
