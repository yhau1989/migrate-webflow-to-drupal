The mayor was recently in Pennsylvania to support US Senate candidate Democrat Joe Sestak.&nbsp; A headline at the <em>New York Daily News </em>politics blog read: “<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/08/bloomberg-not-running-for-pres.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg (not running for president) tries to avoid cheesesteak test</a>.” &nbsp;Though the Independent mayor opted not to chow down in front of the cameras, his supporters remain determined to see his name on their presidential ballots, as demonstrated by <a href="http://www.runmikerun.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated websites</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2212664837" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook groups</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps more than anything else, it is this support, and the obvious desire among the wider electorate for viable alternatives to the candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties, that keeps Michal Bloomberg’s name on the short list of potential Independent presidential candidates. &nbsp;Of course, it also helps that he is a billionaire. &nbsp;</p><p>On a recent episode of the <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/chris-matthews-on-2012-3rd-party-all-depends-on-whether-sarah-palin-runs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Matthews Show</a>, the host concluded his broadcast by asking his four guests, “if President Obama’s approval numbers lag into 2012, will we see the first serious Independent candidate for president since Ross Perot in 1992?” &nbsp;The panel essentially reached a unanimous agreement that Bloomberg would likely run for president as an Independent.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, Bloomberg and Paul are arguably beyond their political prime. &nbsp;In 2012, Bloomberg will be 70 years old. &nbsp;Paul will be 77. &nbsp;Depending on the results of this year’s elections, the likes of Paul and Bloomberg may also be eclipsed by any number of third party and Independent candidates for Congress, Senate or Governor. &nbsp;For instance, if any of the many promising Independent candidates for Governor across the country this year are victorious in November, it is likely they will instantaneously be accorded the status of presidential contenders by media and polling organizations. &nbsp;For this reason alone, it should be considered too early to reasonably speculate about the 2012 presidential election.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I am looking forward to the presidential elections of 2040. &nbsp;If, over the next thirty years, the US electorate proves incapable of retiring the majority of sitting legislators and executives, and if, over the same period, the free market proves incapable of retiring the majority of television talking heads we are forced to tolerate, it is a good bet that by 2040 time itself will have retired them for us.</p>
