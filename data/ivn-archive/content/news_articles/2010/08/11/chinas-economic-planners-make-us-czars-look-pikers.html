California's secretary of state, Debra Bowen, this week certified a ballot measure for the November 2 general election that would suspend the ground-breaking law until unemployment drops below 5.5% for four consecutive quarters (currently over 12%).”&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese will have none of that voting rubbish stand in the way of what will “enhance the structure of production, heighten the standard of technical capability and international competitiveness and realize a transformation of industry from being big to being strong.”&nbsp;</p><p>However you view the concept of nationwide industrial planning, it’s hard to argue that the Chinese are choosing long-term benefits over short-term results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the United States has lost its manufacturing edge because we allowed our factories to stagnate rather than finding ways to invest in their future.&nbsp; It became easier to switch our focus from making things to manipulating money as the core of America’s success.&nbsp;</p><p>And look where that got us.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a better example of environmentalism leading to a positive impact on future economic success than the Chinese actions.&nbsp; Of course, it’s also true that China has not suffered an economic meltdown quite as long-lasting as ours (although the Shanghai market is now down <a href="http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CN%3bSHI" rel="noopener noreferrer">29%</a> since its November '09 post-crash high); nor is it suffering from the unemployment dislocation that we have experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>So, our fear of the negative impact of taking tough environmental actions is understandable.&nbsp; And no one wants to emulate the level of government control that is common in the Communist world.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the dissension that comes with any recommended, legislated or regulated change in our American processes begins to look weak-kneed in light of the heavy hand of China’s bureaucrats.&nbsp;</p><p>Do we have a five-year plan?&nbsp;</p><p>Do we need one?</p>
