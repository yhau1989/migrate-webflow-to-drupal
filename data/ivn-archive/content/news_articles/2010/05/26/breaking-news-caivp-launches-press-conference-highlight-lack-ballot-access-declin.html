<p>In light of onerous ballot signature requirements for Decline to State candidates, the California <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> is challenging the state legislature to remove these unfair barriers that shield the two-party system from legitimate competition.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://caivn.org/about" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAIVP</a> posits that <a href="http://www.caivn.org/ballot-measure/proposition-14" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 14</a>, the open primary initiative, will provide a long-term fix, immediate action must be taken by the legislature if Decline to State candidates are to participate in this year's November elections.</p>

<p>CAIVP proposes making June 7 the commencement for filing as a Decline to State candidate, and has secured legal counsel to explore potential court remedies if the legislature does not act.</p>

<p>CAIVN contributor, <a href="http://www.caivn.org/users/greg-lucas" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Lucas</a>, is on the scene and will be providing a detailed summary of the press conference as soon as it ends.&nbsp; Stay tuned for further coverage.</p>
