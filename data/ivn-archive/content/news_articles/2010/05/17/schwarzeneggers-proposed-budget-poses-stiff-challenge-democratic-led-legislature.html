The governor is proposing a complete elimination of CalWORKS, leaving California as the only state in the nation without any kind of welfare to work programs.&nbsp; CalWORKS is primarily funded by the federal government ($3.7 billion) and is approximately 2.4 percent of the entire California budget.&nbsp;</p><p>Other cuts proposed are to the in-home care for the 430,000 elderly and disabled Californians, Medi-Cal and to the Healthy Families programs which provides health insurance to 700,000 low-income children in California.&nbsp; The governor is also seeking to eliminate child care subsidies for poor families, affecting another 142,000 children.</p><p><br><br>Other cuts proposed are a five percent salary reduction for all state employees, a 60 percent reduction in mental health services, and prison cost reductions.</p><p><br><br>On the other hand, spending on education funding will hold at its current level for K-12, community colleges and for the four-year university systems which includes restoring previously proposed cuts to US and CSU systems.&nbsp; The $140 million in funding cuts to the state parks will also be restored.</p><p><br><br>The only place the governor is looking to raise revenue is by trying to catch more people speeding with upgraded cameras at city and county intersections.</p><p><br><br>Outraged of course are Democrats who have declared the budget DOA.&nbsp; Citing the severe toll the recession has already taken on California families, particularly those who are poor and low-income, Democrats are dismayed that the governor plans to continue the corporate tax subsidies that are costing the state an estimated <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/may/14/schwarzenegger-lays-out-bleak-california-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 billion</a> per year. <br><br>Governor Schwarzenegger <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/14/BA2S1DEV6K.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news#ixzz0o9nJGGac" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that his proposed budget “….. should be a reflection of what we in California value most, and what my administration stands for, in good times and in bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed.&nbsp; Let’s see if the Democratic-led legislature can do a better job of reflecting California’s values when they negotiate for a final budget.</p>
