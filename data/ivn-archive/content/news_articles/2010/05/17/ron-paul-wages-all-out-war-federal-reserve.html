It's very bizarre," Paul said. "They can bail out their friends and let the people they don't like fail, and create a trillion dollars or more out of thin air in order to prop up some companies at the expense of others ... It's absolutely bizarre and, yes, the American people right now I think are waking up to it.</p><p>Paul believes the Federal Reserve's inflationary policies are largely responsible for the current, severe recession brought about by massive deficit spending, and a stock, credit, and housing bubble financed by the Fed's artificially low interest rates over the last decade.&nbsp; He also believes that the Fed is likely bailing out European banks as the EU's debt crisis intensifies.</p><p>The Congressman predicts that the Fed's actions, coupled with the government's insatiable spending habits, will ultimately lead to a U.S. Dollar crisis within the next few years in a scenario similar to that being played out in Europe at this time.&nbsp; He said in his CNBC interview, "...the economic laws will bring this to an end and probably in the not-too-distant future."</p><p>Dr. Ron Paul's views on the Fed, once considered enigmatic, unpopular, and irrelevant, have become a mainstream issue since the crash of 2008/2009.&nbsp; His views have united Democrats and Republicans alike, fueled an entire grassroots political movement, and put the Titan of Wall St in the cross-hairs of Congress and the American people.</p><p>So, while the Federal Reserve may have won the battle in securing only a limited audit this time, it may be in danger of losing the war.</p>
