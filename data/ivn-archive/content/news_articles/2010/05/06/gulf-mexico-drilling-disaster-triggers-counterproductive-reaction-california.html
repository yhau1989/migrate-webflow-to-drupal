It has been 40 years since Platform A spewed 3 million gallons into the ocean and onto our beaches, and yet that platform is still operating today.”</p><p><br>Krop’s reaction to the Governor’s announcement is, to say the least, amazement.&nbsp; “The irony is, we thought the opposite would happen as a result of the Gulf Coast accident, and that people would turn to us with open arms and embrace this plan,” she told me.</p><p><br><br>The withdrawal means that Californians' desperately overdrawn bank accounts will not receive a transfusion of $100 million or more promised by PXP under the terms of the agreement.&nbsp; "It will not happen here in California," Schwarzenegger said at a news conference. "If I have a choice between the $100 million and what I see in the Gulf of Mexico, I'd rather just figure out how to make up for that $100 million."</p><p><br>Schwarzenegger’s decision is one sign of an unfavorable swing in the public’s desire to drill for oil without regard to the risks.&nbsp; And it puts EDC in the odd position of appearing to stand against a pro-environmental shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Krop says that is far from the reality of the breakthrough shut down proposal that EDC has negotiated.&nbsp; She plans to continue taking the story of T-Ridge beyond Santa Barbara in order to win more converts.</p><p><br>However, the Governor’s withdrawal of support is likely to sound the death knell for the plan, which remains unpopular in Sacramento and unapproved by the State Lands Commission (SLC).&nbsp; And it may seem like the right thing to do in response to the accident on the Gulf Coast.&nbsp;</p><p>But it leaves California in a more vulnerable position, and eliminates the possibility of setting end-dates for offshore drilling.</p>
