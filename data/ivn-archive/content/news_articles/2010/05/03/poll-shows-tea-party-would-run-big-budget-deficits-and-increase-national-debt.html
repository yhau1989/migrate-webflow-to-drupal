Bush, and are reluctant to cut spending in the federal budget's biggest components:&nbsp; Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Defense.</p><p>In a CBS/NY Times <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20002529-503544.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a>, 91% of Tea Partiers supported a smaller government with fewer services.&nbsp; However, 62% stated that they believed Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are worth the cost.&nbsp; But, a <a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/File:Fy2009spendingbycategory2.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">pie chart</a> for FY 2009 reveals that these three entitlement programs accounted for a whopping 42% of the federal budget.</p><p>Defense spending (DoD and the War on Terror) accounted for a substantial 22% of the federal budget, and anecdotal evidence seems to strongly suggest that the Tea Party (non-Ron Paul faction) has no interest in cutting military spending.</p><p>Taken together, entitlement and military expenditures comprise approximately 64% of the federal budget, yet Tea party supporters are hesitant to make any cuts in these critical areas of the budget, despite record deficits.&nbsp;</p><p>Surprisingly, their hesitancy is also consistent with three other key <a href="http://blogs.ajc.com/cynthia-tucker/2010/04/27/tea-party-hypocrisy-on-medicare-and-social-security/" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistics</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked what they were most angry about, Tea Party supporters ranked government spending behind health care reform and a government that was not properly representing the people.&nbsp; When asked what the primary goal of the Tea Party movement should be, only 45% selected reducing the federal government.&nbsp; And when asked to decide between tax cuts or deficit reduction, 49% favored tax cuts, while 42% favored deficit reduction.</p><p>Even more telling, 66% of Tea Party supporters viewed Sarah Palin in a positive light, 57% viewed George W. Bush positively, and a mere 28% viewed Ron Paul favorably.&nbsp; But, these preferences seem to strongly contradict a message of limited government and less debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Palin defended the $700 billion Wall St bailout during the 2008 presidential campaign, and supported John McCain's big spending policies.&nbsp; Palin also strongly supports the current $1 trillion military budget.</p><p>And as we all know, George W. Bush and a Republican Congress (for most of his administration) never balanced the budget, added trillions to the national debt, helped devalue the US Dollar by 20%, grew the size of the federal government, and bailed out Wall St.</p><p>Ron Paul, on the other hand, rails against unbalanced budgets, federal bailouts, a devalued Dollar, and a growing Federal Government.</p><p>And he walks the walk too.&nbsp; Just this year, he returned <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/03/01/congressman-ron-paul-returns-whopping-100000-his-office-budget-us-treasury" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100,000</a> of his Congressional office budget back to the US taxpayers, continuing a long tradition of running budget surpluses and personally returning them to the Treasury.&nbsp;</p><p>Taken in their totality, the poll numbers appear to strongly contradict the public message of the Post-Obama, Sarah Palin-led Tea Party movement.&nbsp; While the message is one of fiscal conservatism, the numbers show that much like the Reagan (who had a Republican Senate for most of his administration) and George W. Bush administrations, the Post-Obama Tea Party would cut taxes, run big budget deficits, skyrocket the national debt, weaken the Dollar, and increase the size of the Federal Government.</p><p>As a result, critics may have a case when they point out that the current Tea Party movement is more about politics than it is about actual policy.</p>
