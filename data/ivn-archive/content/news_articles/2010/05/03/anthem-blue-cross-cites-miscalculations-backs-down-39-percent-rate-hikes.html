California legislators are also <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0430-anthem-20100430,0,2916652.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">considering</a> a bill that would extend the rate review process now in place for car and property insurance to health insurance.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>Whether or not Anthem is telling truth, Anthem’s health insurance policy owners in California have at least two additional months prior to any proposed rate increases.</p><p>Let’s hope Anthem’s re-submission to request revised rate changes truly reflects the market rate.</p>
