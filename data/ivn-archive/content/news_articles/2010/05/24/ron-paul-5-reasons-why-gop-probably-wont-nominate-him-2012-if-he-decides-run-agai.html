His libertarian-leaning views, especially in light of recent events surrounding his son's Senatorial candidacy, would likely be viewed as a burdensome liability come election time.</p><p><br><br><strong>Argument #4</strong>:&nbsp; Despite his impressive showing against President Obama in the Rasmussen Poll, the GOP views Paul as completely unelectable.&nbsp; His hyper-fiscal conservatism, perceived weakness on war policy, and lack of "presidential" qualities are construed as deal breakers.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be noted that last year, Mitt Romney <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2012/2012_match_ups_obama_romney_tied_at_45_obama_48_palin_42%20%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">also tied</a> Barack Obama in a Rasmussen Poll, and like Paul, beat Obama in the Independent category, though by a much smaller margin.&nbsp; The difference is, Mitt Romney is a GOP superstar, while Paul is not.</p><p><br><br><strong>Argument #5</strong>:&nbsp; Rand Paul's recent controversy over <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/05/20/rand-paul-toasted-even-handed-rachel-maddow-over-basic-civil-rights" rel="noopener noreferrer">Civil Rights</a> and his comments regarding BP could prove detrimental to his father's potential 2012 presidential bid.&nbsp; Forced to defend his son, Ron could be portrayed as a Republican who is "out of touch" with mainstream America, particularly minorities.</p><p><br><br>While Dr. Paul may be the GOP's purest fiscal conservative, champion of limited government, and most prescient economist, it seems doubtful that he would fare much better in 2012 compared to 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>That is why, if he decides to run, he may want to consider an Independent bid.&nbsp; Independents are the largest and fastest growing segment of the national electorate, Americans are growing increasingly frustrated with both major parties, and Dr. Paul can appeal to a wide swath of voters on a number of issues.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, his Audit the Fed bill received strong bipartisan support.&nbsp; His anti-war, non-interventionist foreign policy is well-received by libertarian-leaning Republicans, liberal Democrats, and some Independents.&nbsp; His staunch fiscal conservatism, in an era of crippling debt, receives strong support from Blue Dog Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, his support for the legalization of marijuana and his unwavering defense of civil liberties, even in times of war, draws support across the political spectrum.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, his reputation for standing up to both major parties could be an advantage in a climate where <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/05/12/new-poll-shows-31-americans-want-3rd-party" rel="noopener noreferrer">31%</a> of Americans want a 3rd party.&nbsp;</p><p>The logistics of an independent, third party bid would certainly be difficult, especially in an environment that overtly favors the two-party system, but with an army of rabid supporters, the ability to raise record amounts of cash, and multi-partisan support on an array of issues, Dr. Ron Paul could prove more competitive than people think.&nbsp;</p><p>That's my opinion.&nbsp; What's yours?</p>
