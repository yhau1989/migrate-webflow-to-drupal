They say their plan will spare more than 400,000 jobs that the governor's proposal — with its deep cuts to social services and child care programs — would cost the state.</p><p>And while the Assembly Democrats recognize this is not a long term solution, they have proposed the following:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Borrow $8.7 billion against the California Beverage Recycling Fund. The borrowing would seed a "Jobs and Economic Stability Fund" to head off the elimination of the state's social program and pay off debts the state owes to school districts and local governments</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charge an “oil tax” on production to pay the debt.&nbsp; As the only oil-producing state in the nation that doesn’t tax oil production (including TX and AK), the proposed oil tax is expected to generate $900 million next year alone.</p><p><br><br>Like the Senate’s plan, the Assembly also delays the planned corporate tax breaks and discontinues the sales tax increase.&nbsp; In fact, Assembly Democrats have even claimed that their approach could be passed by a simple majority because there is no tax increase as the oil tax revenue will be offset by the drop in the sales tax.</p><p><br><br>The Democrats hope to tap into the rage over the BP oil spill and the enormous profits of the oil companies in recent past. According to reports this week, Assemblyman Alberto Torrico, D-Newark <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15162010?source=rss&amp;nclick_check=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "Even Sarah Palin in Alaska didn't give away the oil for free.&nbsp; We continue to see that corporations are seemingly above the law."</p><p><br><br>Both plans have been criticized by the Governor, as well as Assembly and Senate Republicans charging accounting gimmicks and lack of proposed spending cuts. On the other hand, the state’s largest union, the SEIU, has shown support for the approach by the Senate and Assembly Democrats.</p><p>The current “taxes vs. spending cuts” debate has worn out it’s welcome. With all budget plans now on the table, it is time to drop ideology and, instead, seek and implement real solutions to solve the state’s financial crisis.</p>
