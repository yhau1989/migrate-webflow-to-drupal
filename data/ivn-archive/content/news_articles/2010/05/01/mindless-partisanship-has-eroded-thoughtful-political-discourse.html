Buckley and politicians such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) to find much in the way of politics as an intellectual pursuit.</p><p><br>There have been many other times in our nation’s history when shouting overwhelmed thoughtfulness, so I’m not trying to argue that we’re in totally unique circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>But during my lifetime, I have never experienced such a surfeit of stupidity, a torrent of tantrums, and a diminishment of deep thinking.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There were always people around who spoke in simplistic and often hateful terms about groups with different backgrounds and opposing political persuasions.&nbsp;</p><p>But, for the most part, those people in responsible positions – whether in politics or the media – took moderate stances.&nbsp;</p><p><br>So what has made it okay to brook laughably unsupportable positions about your adversaries, and do so with impunity?</p><p>One reason could be the absence of critical thinking skills.&nbsp; In a world that is largely driven by marketing tactics such as branding and catch phrases, it is tough to avoid the line of least resistance in decision-making.&nbsp;</p><p>The easy way to bust through the information overload is to follow some ready-made, simplistic guideline prepared for you.&nbsp; There’s no need to worry about the complexity of an issue when you have a pre-packaged decision.</p><p><br>It’s not so much the macro positions that get determined this way – people don’t change their stripes on a whim.&nbsp; It’s the nuance that is lost.&nbsp;</p><p>Deeper thought invariably leads people away from extremes as they gain an understanding of alternate positions.&nbsp; But there’s little room for alternatives when every decision is a loyalty litmus test.</p><p><br>The words that are uttered daily by politicians and commentators are astounding.&nbsp; Political leaders of every stripe are accused of being Nazis or socialists without a shred of evidence to support that view.&nbsp; The apparent knowledge of these political ideas is so shoddy that politicians are sometimes accused of holding opposing views simultaneously.</p><p><br>When combined with current coarseness of language, oversimplified and overheated rhetoric takes on a tone of disrespect to political leaders.&nbsp; Politicians may deserve our disrespect, but not on the basis of their party preference alone.&nbsp;</p><p>It is ridiculous on its face that all the members of one party are villains while the others are heroes.&nbsp; This is a democracy that balances itself with a two-party system.&nbsp; But the concept of a “loyal opposition” has practically disappeared from our political landscape.</p><p><br>Spirited debate and strong feelings are respectable parts of a political process.&nbsp; But the absence of respect for others and the replacement of thoughtful discussion with sloganeering are not advancing our state and our nation.&nbsp;</p><p>If we don’t insist on a higher form of political discourse, then we are likely to suffer the consequences of narrow-minded decisions for years to come.</p>
