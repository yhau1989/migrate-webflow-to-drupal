Reducing the amount of Border Patrol agents.</p><p><br>2. Cutting funding for a “virtual fence” along the U.S.-Mexico border, which is the technologically-advanced fence armed by several surveillance devices.</p><p><br><br>Overwhelmingly, Republicans do not see the current immigration reform effort as effective, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/36578.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">labeling</a> it as a blanket amnesty bill and as soft on other border-related crimes.&nbsp; With this in mind, the right will likely paint the Democrats as weak on national security with the new cuts.</p><p><br><br>Meanwhile, in addition to portraying themselves as friendly to the Hispanic community, Democrats will likely play up the effectiveness of the administration’s decision.&nbsp; In other words, more money does not equal less illegal immigration and border-related crime. In a sense, this may be true.</p><p><br><br>Then again, it might just depend on how those particular resources are allocated.&nbsp; Illegal immigration activity still continues to this day despite increased funding for border patrol under the Bush administration.</p><p><br><br>So what is the Obama administration’s proposed solution?</p><p><br><br>With upcoming comprehensive legislation in play, the administration seems to be laying the foundation for passage by narrowing its efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Examiner, the administration will shift their money away from trying to catch illegal immigrants coming across the border of Mexico with California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.</p><p><br><br>Instead, funds will go toward Border Enforcement Security Task Forces in non-border cities.&nbsp; These cities include Honolulu Hawaii; San Francisco, California; and Massena, New York.&nbsp; These task forces will seek to prevent illegal drugs from being dispersed by criminal organizations across U.S. borders.</p><p><br><br>This will most certainly delight advocates of a comprehensive immigration reform bill, some of whom recently chanted ‘No human being is illegal’ at the recent May Day rally in Washington DC and at similar rallies across the nation.</p><p><br><br>However, with this new approach, some might see that the mark is being missed by having less eyes on the border and more shifted inland to drug distributors.&nbsp; Shifting enforcement to some major cities listed might work in a place like Florida, which does not border a foreign territory and does not provide easy access between countries.</p><p><br><br>But it most surely will not alleviate the crime occurring in states that border Mexico, where drug cartels cross over with fresh supplies on a frequent basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the true solution is not to abandon the federal role in immigration altogether.&nbsp; After all, it is their constitutional responsibility.<br><br>Or rather, perhaps it is the role of the federal government to allow the states to have more control over their immigration enforcement.&nbsp; For instance, the Arizona model of immigration enforcement already has some illegals <a href="http://www.redstate.com/tabithahale/2010/04/28/illegals-leaving-az-now-that-being-illegal-is-illegal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving the state</a>.</p><p><br><br>Perhaps California would also benefit from Arizona's model of immigration enforcement.</p>
