They could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own countries by their influence over the flow of current funds though bank loans, the discount rate, and the re-discounting of commercial debts; they could dominate governments by their own control over current government loans and the play of the international exchanges.” (<em>Tragedy &amp; Hope</em>)&nbsp;</p><p>This domination of bankers has played a major role in worldwide suffering.&nbsp; Addressing the issue deserves applaud in itself.&nbsp; The reform passed sounds promising.&nbsp; Still, as Americans, we have grown accustomed to earmarks and loopholes that deteriorate our legislation.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most go unnoticed for quite some time after the bill is passed.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/senate-vote-signals-histo_b_584853.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a>, the “bill that passed the Senate includes provisions detested by the biggest Wall Street banks that would prevent them from trading in derivatives - the economic time bombs that were at the center of the 2008 financial collapse.”&nbsp; It also imposes “new restrictions on credit rating agencies, limits fees that credit card companies can charge to merchants, and forces big banks to maintain higher capital requirements.”&nbsp; It’s hard to complain with this description; seems to be exactly what we need and want.&nbsp; However, time will tell, as some argue that there are massive <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/16/major-loophole-in-senate_n_577562.html?ref=twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer">loopholes</a> that will enable bankers to continue risky derivative trading.&nbsp;</p><p>In the US, an estimated $24 trillion will be required by taxpayers to aid Wall Street.&nbsp; To borrow an analogy <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Politics/story?id=8127005&amp;page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">made</a> by Rep. Darrell Issa: "If you spent a million dollars a day going back to the birth of Christ, that wouldn't even come close to just $1 trillion -- $23.7 trillion is a staggering figure." The Huffington Post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sen-maria-cantwell/wall-street-has-a-gamblin_b_340252.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:&nbsp; “According to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the nation's five largest commercial banks held 95 percent of the $291 trillion derivatives portfolio of the country's 25 largest bank holding companies at the end of the first quarter. More than 90 percent of those derivatives were in unregulated trading.”&nbsp; In order for this market to exist, gambling laws literally had to be re-written.&nbsp; This fact should serve to define the market as an experiment in “casino-capitalism,” to borrow the author’s term.&nbsp;</p><p>Last June, a <a href="http://www.actindependent.org/G20.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> was sent to the G20 from the “Act Independent” organization.&nbsp; Derivatives, which “are financial instruments based on other financial instruments – paper based on paper,” were estimated to represent a bubble of $1.5 quadrillion dollars, and the letter begged for responsible world leaders to freeze the market for the duration of the crisis.&nbsp; (It should be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10710950" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a>: with the passing of this reform, Obama fulfilled an obligation made to the G20, ahead of schedule.&nbsp; Europe has yet to do so.)&nbsp; Others have <a href="http://community.marketwatch.com/groups/us-politics/topics/12-1-quadrillion-derivatives-bubble-acknowledged" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated</a> the derivatives market at $500 trillion to $1 quadrillion, or 1,000 trillions of dollars.&nbsp; <em>World Net Daily</em> <a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=143057" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimates</a> at least a $600 trillion bubble, pointing out that “even a 10 percent default in derivatives would equal world GDP.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time risky bankers jeopardized the health of our economy.&nbsp; FDR’s response to the Great Depression included the Glass-Steagall Act, a banking law that was repealed during the Clinton administration.&nbsp; For those unfamiliar with the Act, it separated investment banks from commercial banks.&nbsp; The Act also provided for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which allowed the government to guarantee the safety of deposits in member banks.&nbsp; This insurance plan did not cover investment banks.&nbsp; When Clinton passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) (also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999), he did not repeal FDIC.&nbsp; Most would agree that we, the taxpayers, do not want an insurance plan provided by the government to speculating bank investors.&nbsp; By the turn of the millennium, FDIC insured deposits, for the first time since 1933, that could be invested in risky markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps derivatives were illegal between 1936 and 1983 for a reason.&nbsp; This law was repealed by the Futures Trading Act of 1982.&nbsp; The Savings and Loan (S&amp;L) crisis soon followed.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1994, Orange County suffered a financial meltdown thanks to derivatives.&nbsp; <em>Business Week</em> encouragingly <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1994/b340434.arc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a>:&nbsp; “The meltdown also could invite an era of far more intense regulation in both the municipal and derivatives markets--both of which, until now, have largely avoided Washington's gaze.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fifteen years later, at least we can say we’re moving in the right direction.&nbsp; Then again, time will tell… <br><br></p>
