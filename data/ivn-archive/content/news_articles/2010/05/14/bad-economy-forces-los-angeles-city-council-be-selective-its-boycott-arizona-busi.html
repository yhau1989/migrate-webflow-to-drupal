If I come across an officer who's having a bad day and feels that the picture on my ID is not me, I can be … deported, no questions asked. That is not American," said Ed Reyes, a Los Angeles councilman who has been very vocal about the new law.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Racism charges aside, however, boycotting the new law will do more than financially <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2010/05/11/california-boycott-arizona-immigration-law-picks-steam-hispanic-community-stands-" rel="noopener noreferrer">hurt</a> many in the Arizona Hispanic community.&nbsp; The already struggling job market within the city government sector of Los Angeles is also likely to take a hit.&nbsp; Industries that are a big part of the California economy are <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/custom/topofthetimes/callocal/la-me-0513-arizona-boycott-20100513,0,5535709.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">just as likely</a> to lose revenue as well, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p><p><br><br>Two industries that seem to receive special attention from city officials are the Port of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles International Airport.&nbsp; According to the LA Times, officials from these two industries are uncertain of the boycott’s effect and are awaiting a pending review from boards that oversee the port, airport, and city utilities.</p><p><br><br>Concerning how much money is estimated to be lost in these particular industries, the numbers vary.&nbsp; From contracts that Los Angeles has with two Arizona-based airlines, US Airways and Mesa Air, The Times reports that LAX receives $22 million dollars in revenue.</p><p><br><br>Pertaining to revenue generated at the Port of Los Angeles, CNN <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/12/los-angeles-passes-arizona-boycott-over-immigration-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that the Harbor Department has $26 million in contracts with Arizona and has come out in opposition to the resolution. <br><br>That Los Angeles’ boycott is a very targeted one is all the more highlighted by the resolution’s prohibitions.&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2010/10-0002-s36_rpt_cla_5-11-10.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">resolution</a>, travel by city officials is prohibited “unless special circumstances can be demonstrated to the Council that the failure to authorize such travel would seriously harm City interests.”&nbsp; The resolution also directs city departments to “refrain from entering into any new or amended contracts to purchase goods or services from any company that is headquartered in Arizona.”</p><p><br><br>At the same time, the language of the resolution is such that it will only refrain from those new contracts if there is “no significant additional cost to the City.”&nbsp; While city council members are asserting that they stand against the law based on principle, their conviction does not rest on principle alone.</p><p><br><br>In the resolute moves the council makes, they will take into account the economic interests of the city.&nbsp; Given the close business relationship that Arizona and Los Angeles have in common, council members might find it a little more cumbersome than they thought to carry out the boycott.</p>
