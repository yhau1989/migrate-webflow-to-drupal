According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $34 million given by the securities and investment industry in the 2010 election cycle, 62% has gone to Democrats and 37% to Republicans.</p><p>Leading Democratic Senators Chris Dodd and Charles Schumer have received nearly <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/2010/0106/Chris-Dodd-How-much-did-Wall-Street-give-him" rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a> in Wall St donations over the last couple of decades.&nbsp; Democratic Senators Harry Reid and Blanche Lincoln have held huge Wall St fundraisers this year.&nbsp;</p><p>President Obama received nearly <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703763904575196550713825286.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 million</a> from the securities and investment industry during his presidential campaign, and approximately $1 million from Goldman Sachs employees.</p><p>It is also worth noting that a strong Goldman Sachs connection currently exists in the Obama administration.&nbsp;</p><p>Greg Craig, Obama's first White House counsel, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Is-Goldman-Obamas-Enron-No-its-worse-91613449.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">joined</a> Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; Rahm Emmanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, was paid $35,000 as a consultant to Goldman Sachs while also working as Bill Clinton's top campaign fundraiser.&nbsp; Warren Buffett, one of Obama's top economic advisers, is a staunch supporter of Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; Mark Patterson, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's Chief of Staff, was a Goldman Sachs lobbyist before joining the Treasury.&nbsp; Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Robert Hormats, Undersecretary of State for economic, energy, and agricultural affairs, <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/21/92637/goldmans-connections-to-white.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">both</a> worked for Goldman Sachs before joining the Obama administration.</p><p>And let's not forget that current Obama economic adviser, Larry Summers, and former Clinton Treasury secretary, Goldman Sachs CEO, and Citigroup Chairman, Robert Rubin, were strong advocates for <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-bill-clinton-larry-summers-and-bob-rubin-gave-me-lousy-advice-about-derivatives-2010-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">rolling back</a> market regulations in the '90s.</p><p>So, instead of railing against Republicans, Mr. Carter should have been railing against both Republicans and Democrats. Emotionally-based partisanship only serves to entrench the two-headed, one-party monster.&nbsp; Top levels of both parties have been stained by powerful corporate interests and Wall St lobbyists.&nbsp; Both parties do the bidding of Goldman Sachs and the big banks.</p><p>Until Mr. Carter and other highly influential and intelligent individuals like him wake up to this fact and cast off the counter-productive fetters of blind partisanship, Main St will continue to suffer at the hands of party elites and Wall St banksters.</p>
