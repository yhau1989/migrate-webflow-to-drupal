Just over half said they believed the country would be better off because of the package.&nbsp; And these are numbers before any of the benefits of health care reform have even kicked in.</p><p><br><br>Two approaches with two significantly different outcomes.&nbsp; I guess we will know where Californians stand in November.</p>
