Yet, only a quarter of those polled believe the bill will benefit them directly.</p><p>In fact, most people believe health care reform will help lower-income and uninsured Californians. Support and opposition predictably broke down along party lines with 73 percent of Democrats supporting the law vs. 14 percent who oppose it, while 74 percent of Republicans oppose the law with only 19 percent in support.&nbsp; 53 percent of non-partisans also support the bill vs. 34 percent opposed. One in three would like to see the law repealed.&nbsp;</p><p>Not surprisingly, there are some provisions in the bill that garner tremendous support.&nbsp; People support the provision that would prohibit insurance companies from dropping coverage for people who become sick (81 percent).&nbsp; They support prohibiting insurance companies from denying children coverage because they have a pre-existing condition (78 percent), and they support requiring health insurance companies to cover people despite any health conditions that may have arisen in the past (69 percent).&nbsp;</p><p>The legislature is right to move forward as reforming the current health insurance system will be complex and time consuming. Moreover, despite the ideological divide in support and/or opposition to health care reform (with the exception of the strong support for provisions that people view will help them as individuals), possessing nine million uninsured Californians demands that the state make the development of a sustainable and efficient health insurance system a top priority for all Californians.</p>
