Barbara Boxer.&nbsp; Boxer has the chance to strengthen her ties with the Hispanic community given that she <a href="http://www.cbs47.tv/news/local/story/Hundreds-Gather-in-Fresno-for-Immigration-Reform/vIZz8J8OFkGlF7nH-BD8-Q.cspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">supports</a> comprehensive immigration reform.&nbsp; With Boxer’s endorsements from many influential Spanish groups, Republicans have a force to reckon with when they touch the issue of illegal immigration.</p><p><br><br>In a matter that further complicates the debate for Republicans, those who tout their conservatism with their base on illegal immigration forget that conservative icon Ronald Reagan actually supported an amnesty bill.</p><p><br><br>There is an anti-incumbent mood in the air. However, California Republicans still have a steep uphill battle to a November victory.</p>
