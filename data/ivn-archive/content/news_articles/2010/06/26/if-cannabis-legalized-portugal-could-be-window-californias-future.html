A look at Portugal's drug policy might help provide a window into California's future.</p><p>Ten years ago, the European nation decriminalized the recreational use of <em>all</em> drugs (a reform that makes the <em>Tax Cannabis Act</em> quite modest by comparison).&nbsp; The <em>BBC</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7FshBjkS6U" rel="noopener noreferrer">reminds</a> us that "there were warnings the policy would be disastrous and that the country would become a European haven for drugs tourism."</p><p>A decade later, Portugal has not only managed to avoid becoming a festering, unsavory trainwreck of rampant drug addiction and ruined lives- its drug situation has actually improved.&nbsp; By all indications, the country has more positive statistics on drug use than any other in the Eurozone as well as compared to the United States.</p><p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a> <em>TIME Magazine</em>, when Portugal made its sweeping drug reform in 2001, it "had some of the highest levels of hard-drug use in Europe."&nbsp; Only five years later, "illegal drug use among teens in Portugal declined and rates of new HIV infections caused by sharing of dirty needles dropped, while the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction more than doubled." And:</p><p>"Following decriminalization, Portugal had the lowest rate of lifetime marijuana use in people over 15 in the E.U.: 10%. The most comparable figure in America is in people over 12: 39.8%. Proportionally, more Americans have used cocaine than Portuguese have used marijuana."</p><p>In 2001 many people in Portugal felt exactly the same way some Californians may feel about drug decriminalization now, and it's perfectly understandable that someone would feel that way.&nbsp; But ten years later, the Portugese have found that legalizing drugs- even hard drugs- didn't wreck their communities or even cause a spike in drug use.</p><p>If Portugal is any indication, California has nothing to fear from legalizing the possession of a small amount of pot.</p>
