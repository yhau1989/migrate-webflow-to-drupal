Richardson</a> considered whether the tea party movement represents "a third party in the making," writing:&nbsp; "Democrats fear that the angry populism embodied in the growing movement could sweep them from power . . . while the Republicans worry . . . [it could result] in the creation of a new and potentially viable third-party movement that could doom the GOP."&nbsp;</p><p>Their concerns are justified.&nbsp; Consider the case of Florida.&nbsp; The <a href="http://floridateaparty.us/home.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida TEA Party</a> is an officially recognized political party in the Sunshine State.&nbsp; The party has already recruited two candidates for Congress and one for county commissioner.&nbsp; Peggy Dunmire's campaign in CD-8 is sure to be closely watched by national observers, as this seat is currently held by outspoken liberal Democrat Alan Grayson.&nbsp;</p><p>Contacted for comment via email, Mr. Richardson wrote that Dunmire may have a significant impact in the race, "possibly enough to be Alan Grayson's saving grace in what undoubtedly will be a close, hard-fought contest."&nbsp; He continued:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The party's best showings, however, might take place in some of the state legislative races, where the Tea Party could end up with as many as twenty-five candidates," adding that they are "also trying to find a gubernatorial candidate, but time is running short."&nbsp;</p><p>Reading the tea leaves of the public's discontent with the Democratic and Republican parties, even seasoned politicians whose names are virtually synonymous with the political establishment have begun to reinvent themselves as independents.&nbsp; Florida governor Charlie Crist declared that he would run for Senate as an independent once it became clear that he could not defeat tea party favorite Marco Rubio in the Republican primary.&nbsp; The public has responded positively.&nbsp; Numerous opinion surveys show the newly declared independent leading his likely Republican and Democratic rivals.&nbsp;</p><p>This political trend is not confined to Florida, though it may be most pronounced on the east coast, and especially in the northeast where the Republican Party is weakest.&nbsp;</p><p>Real estate mogul Ray Boyd has announced that he will seek to become the first independent candidate for governor of Georgia since 1942, as reported by <a href="http://www.ballot-access.org/2010/05/11/georgia-wont-let-independent-gubernatorial-candidate-re-design-petition-form/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballot Access News</a>.&nbsp; Democrat-turned-independent Tim Cahill's candidacy is ensuring a competitive three-person <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/massachusetts/election_2010_massachusetts_governor" rel="noopener noreferrer">race</a> for governor in Massachusetts.&nbsp; Independent Lincoln Chafee has consistently <a href="http://www.dcpoliticalreport.com/RIPoll.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">led polls</a> in the race for governor of Rhode Island.&nbsp; In Maine, independent gubernatorial candidate Eliot Cutler is holding his own.&nbsp; As the <em>Augusta Insider</em> reported earlier this year: "Cutler is not only raising money, he’s seriously competing with the major-party candidates and their fundraising – no mean feat."</p><p>Strong showings or victories by any of these candidates – or by any of the many other independent and third party candidates for public office at all levels of government, of which there are literally hundreds all across the country – will undoubtedly fuel continued speculation as to the prospects for future third party and independent presidential hopefuls.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, such speculation could easily be put to rest.&nbsp; All we have to do is vote for independent and third party alternatives to the Democrats and the Republicans.</p>
