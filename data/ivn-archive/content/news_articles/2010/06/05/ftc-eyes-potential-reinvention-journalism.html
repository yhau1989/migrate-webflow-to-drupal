<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/theusfederal.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://theusfederal.jpg" title="FTC eyes the potential reinvention of journalism" width="300"></a></p><p>National Public Radio receives over $400 million per year from U.S. taxpayers.&nbsp; While this sounds like a lot, a FTC “staff discussion draft,”&nbsp; entitled “<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/jun15/docs/new-staff-discussion.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potential Policy Recommendations to Support the Reinvention of Journalism</a>” states that, through various subsidies, such as “postal subsidies; journalist tax credits; News AmeriCorps; student media; public media; and especially Citizenship News Vouchers,” the taxpayers' bill “could run as high as $35 billion annually” in the near future.</p><p><br>Glenn Beck talked about it on his radio show Tuesday (6/1), and Fox News has been patting itself on the back ever since.&nbsp; Admittedly, it is true what they say; i.e. few networks are addressing the subject, although the project is one year in the making (draft just released).</p><p>A few days later, Dan Gainorr wrote a very <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/06/03/journalism-doesnt-need-bailout/" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical piece</a> discussing the new FTC release.&nbsp; After reminding us of our rights (“Congress shall make no law… prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press”), he states that “[t]hose freedoms don’t matter to the left. And many journalists, too. They’re desperate for funding and for a career future.”&nbsp; His generalization of the left is a bit cold, and hardly accurate.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his critique of journalists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br>The FTC draft does offer a serious disclaimer, however, stating: “This draft does not represent final conclusions or recommendations by the Commission or FTC staff; it is solely for purposes of discussion.”&nbsp; Still, attention paid to the matter should not be discouraged.</p><p>To be fair, the draft isn’t all doom and gloom.&nbsp; For instance, one suggestion has an element of direct democracy.&nbsp; “Citizenship news vouchers would allow every American tax payer to allocate some amount of government funds to the non-profit media organization of their choice.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another suggestion would overturn a 60-year old law that prohibits content developed for international purposes to be broadcasted domestically, despite the fact that almost “$700 million of taxpayers’ money is spent on content generated for use by Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for international dissemination.”</p><p>Then again, the way they plan to pay for these services, correctly pointed out by Gainorr, is tax, tax, and more tax.&nbsp; Here's a sample:&nbsp; 5% tax on consumer electronics, spectrum auction tax (on auction sales for commercial communication spectrum), a 2% advertising tax, and a 3% ISP-cell phone tax.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>On the international front, investigative journalist Greg Palast has been professionally “exiled” from the U.S. for writing honestly on controversial topics.&nbsp; He’s noted for covering (as a fraud investigator) the <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/slick-operator-the-bp-ive-known-too-well/" rel="noopener noreferrer">first BP oil spill</a> (erroneously referred to as the Exxon Valdez crisis, in 1989).&nbsp; He also investigated in depth the 2000 and 2004 “stolen” elections, hurricane Katrina, and several other significant events.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><br>Why is this pertinent?</p><p>Because today, he has a number of fascinating documentaries that have been shown in the US only after the BBC provided him an outlet.&nbsp; The BBC is the largest broadcasting organization in the world, and is publically funded by UK households.&nbsp; Not even Thatcher could put a stop to that (although she did cut funding).&nbsp;</p><p>As with national healthcare, the waters are muddy on this subject.&nbsp; The pros may sound good, but the cons could be devastating.&nbsp; If governments use their powers to censor the news— in any way— we may find ourselves on the proverbial “slippery slope” to a totalitarian state seen only in dystopian novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
