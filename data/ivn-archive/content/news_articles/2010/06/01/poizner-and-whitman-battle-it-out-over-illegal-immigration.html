She now says she was referring to a guest worker program, but the explanation has holes.”</p><p><br><br>However, Whitman’s inconsistencies seem not to affect her political viability, with her own party at least.&nbsp; This week, Reuters reports that Whitman is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64T1XW20100530?type=politicsNews" rel="noopener noreferrer">recovering</a> her wide lead over Poizner.&nbsp; She has even managed to penetrate politics on the national front, gaining the endorsement of Newt Gingrich, a possible presidential contender.</p><p>While the Republican primary is about as far as Whitman is predicted to go, immigration nevertheless continues to linger in the political spotlight both at the state and national level.&nbsp; According to a Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/immigration/la-me-0531-poll-20100531,0,2177522.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> on the matter, Californians are relatively split on the issue, with 50 percent in favor of the Arizona law while 43 percent are opposed.</p>
