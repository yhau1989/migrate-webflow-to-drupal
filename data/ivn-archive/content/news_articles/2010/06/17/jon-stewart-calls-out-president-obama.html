Bush, only he's spending even more money.&nbsp; And the Democrats in Congress, passionate critics of the Bush administration while in the minority, have offered barely a whimper of protest as the ruling majority.</p><p>Just as many Americans who believed George W. Bush would pursue a policy of fiscal conservatism were duped, it would appear that those Americans who supported Obama's platform to transform US foreign policy have been misled as well.</p><p>Perhaps the <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/05/12/new-poll-shows-31-americans-want-3rd-party" rel="noopener noreferrer">31%</a> of Americans seeking a third party will have the opportunity to rectify the Bush-Obama war policy come 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
