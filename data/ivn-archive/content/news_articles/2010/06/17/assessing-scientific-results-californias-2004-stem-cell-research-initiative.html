Most of the money spent so far has gone into new labs, training, tools and technologies and basic research, building blocks that are necessary precursors to discovery."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day, treatments based on embryonic stem cells may be able to correct any number of life-threatening and disabling conditions. But this prospect is not a tidy matter of changing a few switches in cells and then popping them back into a malfunctioning part."&nbsp;</p><p>She continues:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's no surprise that the initiative's proponents made big promises: They had something to sell. But instant miracles are uncommon in science, and journalists should do a better job making that clear. We need to highlight the uncertainties in science and, in medical quests such as stem cell therapies, emphasize the baby steps involved that in fact are big leaps..."&nbsp;</p><p>While supporters may continue to advocate the vast potential of future embryonic stem cell research, current trends appear to largely falsify the predictions made by this model in 2004.&nbsp; Instead, adult stem cell research has proven a far more cost-effective and efficacious scientific enterprise.&nbsp;</p><p>If science is supposed to be an objective, testable, and results-oriented endeavor, then at this time, non-embryonic stem cell research retains the clear advantage nearly six years into the project. &nbsp;</p>
