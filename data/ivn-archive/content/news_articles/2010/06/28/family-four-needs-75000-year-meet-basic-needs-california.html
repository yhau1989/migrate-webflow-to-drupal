CBP also calculated needs for different family sizes such as one working parent with two children, a single working parent with two children and single adults.&nbsp; A family of four with one working parent needs $54,039 in annual income; a single parent with two children needs $64,239 and a single adult $30,445 each year.&nbsp; The report did not include expenses for cable television, for mobile or smart phones, or for only a single land line.&nbsp;</p><p>The CBP report (<a href="http://cbp.org/pdfs/2010/100624_Making_Ends_Meet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a>) calculated that for a hypothetical family of four with two working adults, one infant and one school-age child, housing, child care, taxes and health insurance were the top four household expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing - 20% of monthly budget at $1,502 per month (two bedroom apartment)&nbsp;</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child care - 17.5 %&nbsp; of monthly budget at $1,139 per month&nbsp;</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health insurance- 17% of monthly budget at $1,021 per month ($500 deductible family policy from Kaiser)&nbsp;</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes - 14.3% percent of annual budget&nbsp;</p><p>The report assumed that a two working parent family with two children would pay $1,021 per month for health insurance from the private market. While half of California workers younger than 65 have employer-based health insurance with an average monthly cost of $283 (all people over 65 are covered by Medicare - single-payer health insurance administered by the federal government), many lower-income workers do not have employee-sponsored health insurance.&nbsp; According to the report, if one parent had employee-based health insurance, they could save an estimated $10,000 annually. Moreover, the employer-based health insurance is tax-free, increasing the benefit to families even more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the <em>Ventura County Star</em>, executive director of the <em>California Budget Project</em> Jean Ross <a href="http://www.vcstar.com/news/2010/jun/24/typical-family-needs-82000-income-to-make-ends" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the report underscores the importance of employer-sponsored health insurance in making ends meet. The report also&nbsp;aims to draw attention to possible effects of&nbsp;the proposed cuts to health care, welfare and other safety net services included in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest budget plan which also slashes funding for child-care.</p><p>Specifically, Ross stated, “We view the report as a tool that can be used to assess the impact of public policies. We believe that public policies do make a difference in the lives of Californians every day.” For example, Governor Schwarzenegger’s proposed budget eliminates all nonschool-based subsidized child care, a proposal designed to save $1.2 billion that would affect services for up to 240,000 children. According to Ross, the loss of child care will “put people at extreme risk of losing a job. We look at the issue of child care as being particularly critical because of its role in helping families to be productive.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>Moreover, the state’s tax increases last year - the reduction in the dependent tax credit and the increase in personal income tax rates - substantially boosted the amount of California income taxes owed by low-income and poor families. For example, the total amount of personal income taxes owed by taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes between $10,001 and $20,000 increased by 17.7 percent between 2008 and 2009, while the taxes owed by taxpayers with incomes between $20,001 and $50,000 rose by 2.8 percent.</p><p>On the other hand, tax liability for high-income taxpayers actually declined. The increase in the state's sales tax rate and the vehicles licensing fee (VLF) also disproportionately affected low-income families since lower-income taxpayers pay a greater share of their incomes in sales taxes and the VLF.&nbsp;</p><p>The report also calculated income needed for different size families in all 58 of the state’s counties which varied widely from county to county. For example, in San Francisco, a single person needs to earn $32,000 annually while a family of four with two working parents must earn $84,000. In Fresno, a single person must earn $26,533 and a family of four with two children must earn $66,963.&nbsp;</p>
