That’s certainly what many voters are feeling at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a recent <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> telephone <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2010/72_of_gop_voters_say_republicans_in_congress_out_of_touch_with_their_base" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> taken of 1,000 likely voters, 72 percent of GOP voters “continue to believe that GOP members of Congress have lost touch with the party base throughout the nation over the past several years.”&nbsp; A mere 21 percent of Republican voters believe that current Republicans in Congress are actually doing a “good job.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, with a 61 percent approval from Democratic supporters, confidence in Democratic members of Congress is higher among their supporters than Republican support of Republican members.&nbsp; Branching out to survey all voters, a shocking 18 percent of them say that the Republican members of Congress have done a “good job” of representing the party’s values.&nbsp;</p><p>Rating the consistency of a party’s actions with its values, voters had higher marks for Democrats.&nbsp; 38 percent of all voters say that Democratic members of Congress have done a “good job” at representing the party’s values.&nbsp;</p><p>What essentially seems to be the case here is that there’s a blurring of the lines between the two parties.&nbsp; Given that voters perceive Republicans as being more inconsistent with party principles, what distinguishes them from Democrats?&nbsp;</p><p>The most telling statement of the report from Rasmussen’s poll is that voters are “unconvinced” that a Republican takeover in November would make a “noticeable” difference.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, 35 percent believe a new party is needed because the difference between Democrats and Republicans is not noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, given the low approval ratings of the Democratic-controlled Congress, voters might perceive Republicans to be the lesser of two evils in the upcoming elections.&nbsp; At the same time, the “lesser” option still has the word “evil” tagged to the label.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Rasmussen</em> poll demonstrates that Republicans must bring fresh solutions to the table if they are to change voters’ perceptions of making a difference after the midterms.&nbsp;</p><p>Is the time coming for Republicans to party like it’s 1994?&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, but their work is certainly cut out for them.</p>
