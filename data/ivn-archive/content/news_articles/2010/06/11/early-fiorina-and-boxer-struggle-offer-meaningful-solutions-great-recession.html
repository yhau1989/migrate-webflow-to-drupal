<p>Coming off a fresh win over her Republican opponents in Tuesday’s primary, Carly Fiorina may have uttered the very words she will regret in November.&nbsp; Speaking without knowledge of a live microphone, viewers caught Fiorina discussing the most non-political issue concerning her opponent; namely, Barbara Boxer’s hairstyle.</p>

<p>The short <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/09/open-mic-catches-fiorina-dig-at-boxer/?fbid=2FmUQG0Wnfe" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a> is now an internet hit, showing how the internet’s viral nature has transformed politics.&nbsp; Damage done with hasty words may not be repairable in the long run, and this may just be the case with Fiorina’s comment.</p>

<p>If voters wish to give her the benefit of the doubt regarding the hair comment, Fiorina <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIaD6SOMBTg&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on the <em>Greta Van Susteren</em> show that she was quoting a friend.&nbsp; Regardless, her comments may further complicate matters in a state where she cannot merely settle for the votes of her conservative base to survive in November.</p>

<p>In California, Fiorina’s victory must come by her ability win over moderates.&nbsp; The conservatives Fiorina won over to her side a minority in the Golden State.&nbsp; Moderates in the state disagree with her on many issues like abortion, West Coast oil drilling, and her opinion of President Barack Obama, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jOrr0sFqSzp3bpbhD-vYiNA-WqVQD9G833IO0" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the AP</a>.</p>

<p>Former governor Sarah Palin, not necessarily viewed as the most unifying figure in California, may also add to the perception that Fiorina will be a divisive figure in the coming months.&nbsp; The former governor’s endorsement also corroborates the idea that Fiorina is not a fresh new voice to California, but is rather just another example of the Republican Establishment conducting business as usual.</p>

<p>The showdown between Fiorina and Boxer will be an election determined by issues voters view as most important.&nbsp; Right now, these very <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/06/07/political-wisdom-watch-the-women/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a> are jobs and the overall economy.&nbsp; If Fiorina desires to have any serious political clout against Boxer, then issues such as jobs and the economy are what she must address.</p>

<p>Real, tangible fallout has yet to be seen with Fiorina’s hair comments; however, she is not alone with the possible stings inflicted by the sound byte.&nbsp; Her opponent, Senator Boxer, is also prone to fall victim, if not cautious.&nbsp; Most recently, Boxer gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJJB7zFsFFE&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech</a> on the Senate Floor in which she invoked the safety of U.S. troops to espouse the idea that “climate change&nbsp;will be, over the next 20 years, the leading cause of conflict, putting our troops in harm’s way.”</p>

<p>In essence, while many Californians are concerned about jobs and the economy, Senator Boxer is portraying herself promoting a partisan agenda, being out of touch with the primary concerns of her California constituency.</p>

<p>At this early stage, it appears as if both candidates facing off this November are currently on bad footing when it comes to reaching voters with relevant solutions.&nbsp; Who will be the first to rebound?</p>
