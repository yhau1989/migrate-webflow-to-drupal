The loan would be repaid with an as yet enacted tax on oil companies.&nbsp; Proposition 58, approved by voters in March 2004, generally prohibits the state from using deficit financing to escape a budget shortfall.&nbsp;</p><p>Brown’s opinion said that even though the Assembly Democrats identify a revenue stream to pay back the loan, it still would be “suspect” under the initiative, which was backed by the GOP governor as a way to “tear up the state’s credit card.”&nbsp; The legal opinion stalls budget negotiations because Assembly Democrats have no apparent fallback even though Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield, a Van Nuys Democrat and chair to the lower house’s budget committee, acknowledged “the Attorney general’s comments will be helpful to us in crafting something that works.”&nbsp;</p><p>For their part, Republicans on the conference committee consider further discussion of the Assembly plan to be a waste of time since the proposal by the lower house’s majority refuses to admit that cuts will be necessary to close the budget gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Senate Democrats propose closing more than one-third of the budget gap by postponing the effective date of several tax breaks enacted in the 2009 budget and continuing several tax increases from the same budget for two years to reduce the state’s shortfall by $4.9 billion.&nbsp; Republican lawmakers – and Schwarzenegger – refuse to back any budget that contains tax increases, which is how they define the postponement of the tax breaks of the 2009 budget.&nbsp; Those reductions were included to win enough GOP votes to reach California’s two-thirds vote threshold for approval of budgets.&nbsp;</p><p>Senate Democrats let the temporary 1-cent increase in the sales tax enacted in the same budget expire at the end of the next fiscal year because it’s “regressive” – a family of four earning $40,000 annually pays the same rate as a billionaire.&nbsp; In contrast, the income tax is progressive – liability increases along with the amount of taxable income – so Senate Democrats maintain a .25 percent surcharge on state income taxes for two years and maintain the dependent tax credit at $102 – down from $319 for two years. Both were parts of the 2009 budget.&nbsp;</p><p>The largest chunk of the revenue increases offered by Senate Democrats is to postpone the effective date of two tax changes benefiting larger corporations for two years and continue for another two years the ban on businesses writing off prior year losses against tax year profits.&nbsp; Doing so saves the state $2 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1 and an additional $1.5 billion the following year.&nbsp;</p><p>In his January budget, Schwarzenegger proposed doing the same thing for one year if federal funds he sought didn’t materialize. Although those funds did not come in at the level the GOP governor wanted, he abandoned the idea in his revised budget in May.&nbsp;</p><p>“After the largest tax increase in our state’s history we cannot ask California taxpayers to continue to pay for Sacramento’s mistakes,” said Aaron McLear, Schwarzenegger’s press secretary, at the time.</p>
