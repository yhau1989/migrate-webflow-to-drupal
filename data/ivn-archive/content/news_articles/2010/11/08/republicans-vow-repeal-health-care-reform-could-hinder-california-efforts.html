In fact, with its 8.5 million uninsured, California has made significant gains over the past few months to expand health insurance coverage.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>Specifically, California was one of the first states to set-up its health insurance exchange that will make available a variety health insurance plans to individuals who do not have health insurance at an affordable rate.&nbsp; California’s Pre-Existing Condition Plan is up-and-running, providing coverage to individuals at affordable premiums who have been denied health insurance due to what insurance companies consider a pre-existing condition.&nbsp; 80% of California’s small businesses that employ 25 people or less are eligible this year for tax credits if they provide health insurance for their employees. California just received a $10 billion Medicaid waiver from the federal government which will allow it to expand Medi-Cal to nearly 2 million Californians, including some the state’s poorest residents. For example, individuals who earn up to 133% of the poverty rate will now be eligible for Medi-Cal.</p><p>Is the plan to vote or take back the funding that has already been authorized when they lack a majority in the Senate and President Obama is in the White House? And what parts of health care reform are they going to repeal?</p><p>Popular, key provisions of the bill have already been implemented, impacting all states.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young people up to the age of 26 can stay on their parents’ health insurance plan if their employer does not offer coverage.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health insurance companies can no longer deny children health care coverage due to a pre-existing condition.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Routine preventative care will no longer be subject to a co-pay or deductible. Preventative services include blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol tests, many cancer screenings, including mammograms and colonoscopies, routine vaccinations and regular well-baby and well-child visits, from birth to age 21, among others.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seniors who have reached the “donut hole” in their Medicare Part D coverage received a $250 rebate this year. Going forward, when seniors reach the “donut hole,” they will get 50% off their prescriptions while in the “donut hole.”</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, by 2014, health insurance companies will not be able to deny individuals health insurance coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and life-time caps on health care services will no longer apply – provisions very popular among the American people.</p><p>Campaigning to repeal health care reform was the easy part, particularly when most Americans are unaware of the legislation’s individual provisions.<span>&nbsp; </span>While Republicans point out that 49% of Americans who voted want health care reform repealed, 47% support it or do not think it goes far enough.&nbsp; Moreover, when people are polled on the individual provisions of the legislation, support for the bill skyrockets.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span> While California’s implementation of health reform and the ability to cover the state’s 8.5 million people without coverage may be at risk, it is also true that there may be a backlash against the repealing the law.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only time will tell.
