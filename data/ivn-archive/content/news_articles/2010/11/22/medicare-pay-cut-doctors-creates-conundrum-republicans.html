He also&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;extend all of the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/11/the_bush_tax_cuts_effect_on_th.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bush&nbsp;tax cuts</a>, a move that will add hundreds of billion of dollars to the&nbsp;federal budget deficit (unless counterbalanced by massive spending cuts across the board), creating&nbsp;little or no stimulus for the ailing economy.</p><p> </p><p>When rhetoric meets the entitlement-spending road, the road usually wins.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note:&nbsp; 13% percent of Californians are on Medicare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
