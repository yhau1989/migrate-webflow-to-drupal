Simultaneously, Yudof is proposing an adjustment in the income level families can earn to qualify for financial aid.&nbsp; Currently, families who earn $70,000 qualify for financial aid.&nbsp; Yudof is seeking to raise the limit to $80,000 which is expected to cover an additional 4,700 students. All told, tuition will continue to be free for more than half of undergraduate students because Cal Grants covers the tuition for students who qualify for financial aid.</p><p> </p><p>The question is, how much longer can Cal State and UC students and their families handle the ever increasing tuition (and subsequent debt) burden, particularly with the dire&nbsp;economic conditions and&nbsp;no guarantee that there will be jobs for these students when they graduate? In the longer term,&nbsp;with&nbsp;so many more jobs requiring a college degree, at what point are we, as a state, unable to fill those&nbsp;positions with our own residents because college becomes so far out of reach for so many?</p>
