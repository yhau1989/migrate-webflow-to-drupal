The essence of the idea, radical at the time, was that employees' brainpower was the company's most important resource."&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>The BusinessWeek story went on to describe how founders Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard created:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "one of the first all-company profit-sharing plans... gave shares to all employees... were among the first to offer tuition assistance, flex time, and job sharing... Today, the behavior of the two founders remains a benchmark for business..."&nbsp; </span><span></span></p><p>Carly Fiorina swooped into H-P as CEO just a few years after the death of Packard, and just three years preceding the death of Hewlett.<span>&nbsp; </span>She took ruthless actions that she believes righted the company and positioned it for success.<span>&nbsp; </span>But she failed to win the hearts and minds of H-P employees as well as the Hewlett and Packard families, who soured on her leadership quickly and even spoke out against her during her Senatorial bid.&nbsp;</p><p>Fiorina's take-no-prisoners campaign grated on many Californians' sensibilities – even as the rest of the country embraced candidates with similarly rigid opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact that she came close to un-seating Boxer highlights the weak state of the incumbent's support.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carly was never able to break into the lead or tighten the race beyond a four or five point margin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Boxer, on the other hand, made no major mistakes and never provided Fiorina the extra boost that might have changed the game.&nbsp; <span></span></p><p>There are a couple of lessons from this year's Senatorial result.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, you can never count out Barbara Boxer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Second, Californians are unimpressed with a business resume when it comes to electing politicians.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hollywood stars such as Reagan and Schwartzenegger are more likely to succeed than a business superstar such as Fiorina or Whitman.<span>&nbsp; </span>Fiorina is cool-headed and direct, but her inability to move people emotionally weakened her chances.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>Business candidates rely on facts and statistics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Political pros (and entertainers) understand the value of anecdotes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Back in 1992, Ross Perot made a major dent in the polls with his charts and graphs on the budget deficit.<span>&nbsp; </span>At one point, Perot led the race with 39 percent of the vote, but he wound up polling 19 percent (after pulling out of the race at one time) – an excellent showing for a third party candidate. Unlike other candidates from the business world, Perot was engaging, fervent and focused on a single issue -- deficit spending. His business background lent credibility to his argument.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>On the other hand, Carly paid more attention to social issues and tried to make herself the "values" candidate.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her business background lent no gravitas to her arguments.<span>&nbsp; A little softening of her image might have helped, as would a softening of her positions. <span>&nbsp;</span>All told, this was not a good year for business candidates in California.<span>&nbsp; </span>And the Republicans missed a genuine opportunity to grab one of California's prized Senate seats.</span></p>
