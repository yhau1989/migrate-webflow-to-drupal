<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/republicrat.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://republicrat.jpg" title="A third party analysis of California's general election ballot" width="300"></a></p><p>The  2010 elections have proven to be an historic year for third party and  Independent politics in the United States, with record high numbers of  third party and Independent candidates across the country seeking to  capitalize on the electorate’s deep discontent with the two-party status quo. &nbsp;</p><p>An analysis of California’s  2010 general election ballot shows that the national trend holds in the  Golden State as well.&nbsp; With  Democratic and Republican candidates dominating media coverage in the  political press, and given the paucity of exposure for third party  candidates, many Californians may well have been surprised to find that  they had no less than six choices in all of the top races for statewide  office.&nbsp; In addition to the Democratic and Republican party nominees,  candidates from the American Independent Party, the Green Party, the  Libertarian Party and the Peace and Freedom Party could all be found in  the races for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,  Controller, Treasurer, Attorney General and US Senate.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the array of choices in races for the US House and the State Legislature was not nearly as uniform.&nbsp; California’s  delegation to the US House of Representatives has 53 seats, all of  which were up for election this year.&nbsp; Two of these races  were uncontested, featuring just one candidate on the ballot. &nbsp;22 of the  53 had only two candidates on the ballot. &nbsp;But there were more than two  candidates on the ballot in the remaining 29 races, constituting just  under 55% of all contests for US House. &nbsp;All in all, there were 42 third  party or Independent candidates on the ballot for US House in  California this year.&nbsp; This is an increase from the elections of 2008,  in which there were 34 third party or Independent candidates for US  House in the state.&nbsp; And in the 2006 midterm  elections, there were under 40 third party and Independent  candidates for the lower house of the US Congress.&nbsp;</p><p>There  are 40 seats in California’s State Senate. &nbsp;Half of these seats were up  for election this year. &nbsp;In these 20 races, 2 went uncontested, 7  featured just two candidates, and the remaining 11, or 55%, featured  more than two candidates. &nbsp;There  are 80 seats in California’s State Assembly, all of which were up for  election this year. &nbsp;53 of these contests featured just two candidates,  23 had more than two candidates, just under 29%, and 2 were uncontested.  &nbsp;All  together, there were 37 third party candidates for the State  Legislature on California’s ballot in 2010. &nbsp;This represents an increase  over the number of candidates for these offices in 2008, when there  were 27 third party and Independent candidates for State Senate and  State Assembly. &nbsp;However, it remains less than the number from the  elections of 2006, in which there were 44 third party and Independent  candidates for the State Legislature. &nbsp;Of  the 153 races for US House, State Senate and State Assembly, 63 had  more than two candidates, which is just over 41% of the total. &nbsp;For the  sake of comparison, consider that in the same set of races on <a href="http://politeaparty.blogspot.com/2010/11/analysis-new-yorks-general-election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York’s general election ballot</a>, only 39 out of 362 contests featured more than two candidates, or 24%.&nbsp;</p><p>The  Libertarian Party fielded the most candidates of any minor party in the  races for US House, State Senate and State Assembly. &nbsp;Of the  Libertarian Party’s 45 candidates, 21 ran for seats in the US House, 6  could be found in races for the State Senate, and the remaining 18 ran  for State Assembly. &nbsp;On  this score, the Peace and Freedom Party came in a distant second,  having run 13 candidates in the same set of races: 7 for US House, 2 for  State Senate and 4 for State Assembly. The  Green Party backed 10 candidates, five for US House and five for State  Assembly. &nbsp;Two of the latter were in races featuring only two  candidates, in which the Green faced off against a Democrat. &nbsp;&nbsp;The  American Independent Party fielded 8 candidates for these offices: 6  for US House, 1 for State Senate and 1 for State Assembly.&nbsp;</p><p>In  addition to candidates running under a party banner, there were three  Independent candidates for US House in California this year.&nbsp; To check out California’s full 2010 general election ballot, as well as election results, follow the appropriate links at the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/2010-elections/2010-election-information/november-2010-general-election.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secretary of State’s</a> website.&nbsp;</p>
