In fact, unions had the most physical presence at this weekend’s rally. &nbsp;<span></span>In terms of numbers, a pictorial <a href="http://blog.eyeblast.tv/2010/10/aerial-shot-comparison-glenn-becks-restoring-honor-rally-vs-progressives-one-nation-rally/" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparison</a> revealed that Beck’s rally brought more people to DC than did One Nation, despite the fact that one speaker at One Nation <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/one-nation-working-together-rally-claims-bigger-numbers-than-restoring-honor/" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is also worth noting that, just as Tea Party members attended Beck’s event, Coffee Party members latched onto the One Nation event as way of showing the political ideals with which they identify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
