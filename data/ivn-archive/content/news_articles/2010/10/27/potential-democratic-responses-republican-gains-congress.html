As a result, they have been able to resuscitate their conservative base and regain many of the Independents who had abandoned them in 2008.</p><p>So how should Obama and the Democrats cope with their reduced numbers in Congress?<span>&nbsp; </span>Peter Baker of the New York Times suggests the Democrats take a page out of Bill Clinton's workbook.&nbsp; "The reality of presidential politics is that it helps to have an enemy," Baker <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/weekinreview/24baker.html?_r=1&amp;ref=peter_baker" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in the Sunday Times, pointing to Bill Clinton and Harry Truman who took this strategy to an art form.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>Clinton had the Newt Gingrich Congress to contend with after the '94 elections.<span>&nbsp; </span>The typical off-year downturn in the majority party was enhanced by the Contract with America and resulted in big losses for Democrats.&nbsp; <span></span>Clinton, acknowledged by most politicians as a brilliant political strategist, turned Gingrich into the bogeyman for the American middle class.<span>&nbsp; </span>By the end of the struggle, Clinton remained very popular (despite Monica Lewinsky et. al.), while Newt had to turn tail and head back to Georgia.</p><p>Truman made the "do-nothing" Congress the enemy of progress, and made himself into an American hero.<span>&nbsp; </span>Obama may well be testing those waters with his recent attacks on John Boehner, the Republican who is likely to be elected Speaker of the House if his party gains a majority.<span>&nbsp; </span>If this negative approach gains traction, then the President may end up better positioned for re-election in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>If all of the dire predictions of Republican gains don't quite pan out in November, the Democrats could claim a pyrrhic victory similar to the one claimed by Pat Buchanan in the 1994 New Hampshire primary.<span>&nbsp; </span>Buchanan's "win" was actually a third place finish, but it was much better than the predictions.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, Buchanan extended the life of his campaign and established himself as an icon of right-wing thinking.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>Democrats could similarly make such a claim if the Republicans fail to capture one or both houses of Congress in November.<span>&nbsp; </span>An assertion of victory would force the Republicans into a defensive mode and give the President and the Democrats greater leverage with the media and the general public.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the D's could take the high road and seek to cooperate with the newly empowered Republicans for the good of the nation.<span>&nbsp; </span>This statesman-like approach would contrast sharply with the Republicans strategy of letting the Democrats govern while they sit back and complain about the process.&nbsp; <span></span></p><p>Then again, it's always possible that Democrats will choose to emulate the Republicans' "just say no" policy and keep the political process in gridlock for another two years.<span>&nbsp; </span>That approach seems to have worked well for the Republicans, even if the country has suffered for it.</p>
