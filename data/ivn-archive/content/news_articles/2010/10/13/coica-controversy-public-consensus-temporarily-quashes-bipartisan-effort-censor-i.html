MP3 blogs and mashup/remix music sites . . . and sites that discuss and make the controversial political and intellectual case for piracy, like pirate-party.us, p2pnet, InfoAnarchy, Slyck and ZeroPaid.”<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>The first site on the aforementioned list is the homepage of the US Pirate Party, which was founded in 2006 to spur reform of copyright, trademark and patent laws, among other things.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>Last week, I contacted Marcus Kessler of the Oklahoma Pirate Party to ask him for his response to the fact that the proposed bipartisan legislation would conceivably result in the censorship of the Pirate Party’s website.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kessler expressed concern that, once created, such blacklists would have a tendency to expand in scope.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I honestly would not be surprised if the websites of the Pirate Parties would be some of the first sites that get taken offline due to this bill. If we take a look at the various "Internet Black Lists" that are used by numerous countries around the world, we find that many of sites listed do not fit the stated purpose of the list,” he wrote via email.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>He furthermore pointed out that already-existing laws are being used and abused to censor political speech online.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Even if this bill only blocks sites based on Infringement,” Kessler stated, “this definition alone could be easily used as a justification to shut down the web presence of private competitors and political opponents. A perfect example would be the current gubernatorial race in Ohio where a <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/10/copyright-abuse-ohio-governor-election" rel="noopener noreferrer">political ad was taken off YouTube</a> under a DMCA notice arguing infringing use, despite the fact that the use of copyrighted material falls under fair use.” &nbsp;<span></span></p><p>The widespread outrage over the bipartisan bill appears to have quashed COICA for now, but it will likely be resurrected following the November elections.<span>&nbsp; </span>The COICA controversy reveals the stark disconnect between the bipartisan consensus of Republicans and Democrats, on the one hand, and public consensus on the proper role of government, on the other.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>For previous coverage of the COICA controversy at CAIVN, see also Chris Hinyub’s <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/10/02/president-obama-endangers-internet-freedom" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> on the connection between this legislation and the Obama administration’s efforts to redesign the Internet in the interests of expanding the surveillance capabilities of the federal government.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
