For Republicans, here’s also to hoping that such a bill wouldn’t be passed during a lame duck session of Congress.&nbsp;</p><p>Another compelling reason why immigration reform will likely not be seen at the top of the Republican to-do list at this time is because of the Tea Party.&nbsp; Assuming that the Republicans adhere to constitutional principles as promised, they will likely begin work in executing the “repeal and replace” of Obama’s healthcare bill, defunding it with the power they have over the purse.&nbsp; They would also use their increased clout in Congress to put even more pressure on the President to answer the question of a weak economy.&nbsp; With these issues first and foremost on the minds of most voters, it’s probably wise that the Republicans aren’t pushing an immigration plan of their own at this point.&nbsp; Immigration, by far, falls behind in importance in relation to the weak economy and high unemployment.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, however, immigration reform will creep back to the surface, and the Republicans will have to be ready with a winning message that pushes back rhetoric labeling them as having no plan and as anti-immigrant.&nbsp; They will have to eventually address it with the awareness that it is still an <a href="http://www.examiner.com/tea-party-in-new-york/arizona-immigration-bill-backed-by-tea-party" rel="noopener noreferrer">important issue</a> to their Tea Party constituents.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, to make gains with Hispanic voters, the conservative party must cast off the stigma of being anti-Hispanic. Instead, it must frame a message that shows the conservative agenda is in the best interests of the traditional values of Hispanics and other immigrant groups. Immigrants in general are not people who want to take over the United States just to plunder the welfare system. They come here for the opportunity that this land offers. By pitching this, Republicans could make inroads with immigrant people groups.</p>
