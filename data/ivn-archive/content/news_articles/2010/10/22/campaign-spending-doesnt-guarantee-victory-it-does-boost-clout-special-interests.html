All hours. All mediums. A football game-break brings three attacks in a row, calling a senator a liar, a vandal and a glutton for debt. A weather update is interrupted by a trio of hits from the other side, making the challenger out to be the worst thing for women since Neanderthal man took up a club as an accessory to romance."&nbsp;</p><p>Brooks counters that the media blitz "isn’t persuasive; it’s mind-numbing. No wonder voters tune it all out. Amid this onslaught, there is no way a slightly richer ad campaign is going to make much difference."&nbsp;</p><p>For a media-savvy reporter, Brooks seems unusually clueless about the effectiveness of mind-numbing advertising – the kind that makes brand names "top of mind" for consumers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such classics as "Squeeze the Charmin" and "Ring Around the Collar" may have been detested by television viewers, but they were effective enough to sell plenty of toilet paper and laundry detergent.<span>&nbsp; </span>What's most important in advertising – political and otherwise – is repetition.<span>&nbsp; </span>The exact nature of the message is secondary.<span>&nbsp; </span>It's a simple equation – the more available money, the larger the ad buy and the greater the name recognition for a given candidate.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>We have very little data that would predict the long-term impact of the Citizens United case, but statistics tells us that there's a mounting cost to electioneering, and that money buys more than votes – it buys influence.<span>&nbsp; </span>So politicians who have to beg for contributions just to maintain a competitive edge over their opponents will be less likely to vote counter to the interests of their direct or indirect benefactors.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, businesses and their shareholders expect a return on their investment.<span>&nbsp; </span>From a corporate point of view, the Supreme Court has opened the doors to "the best government money can buy."<span>&nbsp; </span>And the special interests are all in for the lion's share.</p>
