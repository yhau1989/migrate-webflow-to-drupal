Shasta is far more likely to see heavy snow than the Sierras in Weather Geek’s long-term outlook.<span>&nbsp; </span>AccuWeather.com <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/blogs/news/story/34891/winter-2011-heavier-snow-for-c.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">agrees</a> that there will be more precip up north, but is prognosticating the storm line near or below Lake Tahoe, giving the Sierras a chance for another good winter.<span>&nbsp; </span>Either way, Southern California is in for a dry spell and the resultant water restrictions.<span>&nbsp; </span><span></span>The predictions are all based on a weather phenomenon known as La Nina, which is the polar opposite of last year’s El Nino phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p>El Nino is marked by warmer than normal water in the Pacific that last year translated into active storms in the West and unusually high amounts of precipitation back east.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, last winter was referred to as "Snowzilla" along the eastern seaboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>La Nina occurs when cooler than normal waters are observed in the Pacific.<span>&nbsp; </span>This year, La Nina is expected to result in very strong storms ranging from the Pacific Northwest into the upper mid-section of the country, with average snowfall in the northeast, and very dry conditions across the entire southern tier of the U.S..&nbsp;</p><p>For skiers, the Pacific Northwest, western Canada and the Rockies look like the places to be this season.<span>&nbsp; </span>Canada had a horrific season last year, but is expected to get its ski mojo back this winter.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the east, it looks like an off and on year for winter precipitation.&nbsp;</p><p>It may not be another banner year for snowfall in California, but it doesn’t look like a bust.<span>&nbsp; </span>Storms are likely to be smaller, but colder.<span>&nbsp; </span>The snowpack will once again bear watching.</p>
