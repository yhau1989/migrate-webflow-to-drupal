"We will vigorously enforce the CSA against those individuals and organizations that possess, manufacture or distribute marijuana for recreational use, even if such activities are permitted under state law."&nbsp;</p><p>It was a genuine head-scratching moment for advocates of legalizing the general use of cannabis, but also surprised administration watchers.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all, only a few years ago, the feds decided not to prosecute licensed medical marijuana distribution and consumption.<span>&nbsp; </span>So why the change?</p><p>The ostensible reason is logical enough â€“ one state's rules do not a national policy make, and the DOJ does not want to establish a precedent on the basis of this single California rule change.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, there's something that just doesn't ring true about Holder's out-of-the-blue announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>In a dose of reality, Jacob Sullum of Reason Magazine's 'Hit &amp; Run' blog lists some <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2010/10/15/how-will-holder-vigorously-enf?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reason%2FHitandRun+%28Reason+Online+-+Hit+%26+Run+Blog%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting facts</a> about national pot enforcement.&nbsp; For example, in 2008, there were 848,000 marijuana arrests, with a mere 1% of those arrests made by the feds.&nbsp; In addition, there are only 5,500 DEA agents across the nation, but 70,000 cops in California.&nbsp;</p><p>Sullum notes that the DOJ "certainly can make trouble, but it simply does not have the resources to bust a significant percentage of the state's marijuana offenders now, let alone after every adult is allowed to grow his own pot."<span>&nbsp; </span>It can try to influence the vote on Prop 19.<span>&nbsp; </span>A similar tactic was tried by opponents of Prop 215 (legalizing medical marijuana) back in 1999, in which t<span></span>hey argued that supporting the proposition was no more then a symbolic gesture because federal enforcement would continue unabated.</p><p> </p><p>Not so, <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/pressroom/pressrelease/pr101510.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> Stephen Gutwillig, California director of the Drug Policy Alliance:<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today more than 80 million Americans live in 14 states and the District of Columbia that have functioning medical marijuana laws. All that happened without a single change in federal law."&nbsp;</p><p>Holder's posturing is more likely an effort to put up a tough front for his DEA enforcement team and to undermine potential political leverage for Republicans should the Obama administration show any support whatsoever for softening its position on drug laws.&nbsp;</p><p>The 800-pound gorilla of Prop 19 is whether marijuana should be treated as a safe recreational drug or not.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you believe that there is no greater harm to society from marijuana usage than there is from tobacco or alcohol, marijuana laws are simply a repeat of alcohol prohibition, which put all of the revenue from liquor into the hands of criminals, and denied tax revenues to the government.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you find any drug use whatsoever anathema, then legalization of even the mildest drugs puts us on the slippery slope to societal ruin.</p>
