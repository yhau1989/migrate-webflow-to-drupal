Because there were so many candidates, each one had only a short time to speak, so everyone had to stay sharp and on message. And for the most part, they couldn't veer off into personal attacks.”<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>At the Rochester City Newspaper, Jeremy Moule <a href="http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/news/blog/2010/10/Redlich-Hawkins-make-good-showing-at-debate/#comments" rel="noopener noreferrer">summed up</a> a number of substantive proposals forwarded by Green Howie Hawkins and Libertarian Warren Redlich, and faulted the mainstream media for its superficial coverage of the race, writing:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Third-party candidates often get the major party candidates to address and discuss issues they'd otherwise leave alone. But their voices have been absent this election season, most likely because the coverage is being driven by Paladino. Last night's debate gave New Yorkers a glimpse of what they've been missing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Advocates of closed debates, in which only the Democratic and Republican party candidates are allowed to participate, can often be found arguing that it makes no sense to include candidates who will not win the election.&nbsp; <span></span>Taking this position to its logical conclusion, we may as well do away with elections altogether, as if they were nothing more than a mere formality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nancy Allen, a Green Party activist and long-time advocate of open debates, emphasizes the importance of the free exchange of ideas in a healthy democratic republic.&nbsp; <span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This isn’t only about the right of Green and other alternative party candidates to participate in debates. It’s about the right of voters to hear from all the candidates whose names will be on the ballot. It’s about the right of voters to know which candidate best represents their interests,” Allen states in a <a href="http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2010/10/green-party-candidates-across-the-us-win-some-debates-battle-exclusion-from-others/" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> </span>from the Green Party.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>How can you know which candidate would best represent your interests if the majority of candidates are excluded from debates and candidate forums, and are simply ignored by the mainstream media?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Democrats and Republicans would have us believe that they best represent the people’s interests.<span>&nbsp; </span>What partisan wouldn’t?<span>&nbsp; </span>But, judging from the national mood, there is scant evidence for such a bold assertion.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a multi-polar society like ours, the bipolar Republican-Democrat duopoly simply flies in the face of common sense and democratic values.</p>
