<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/tea_party_protest.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://tea_party_protest.jpg" title="Left-leaning media debate potential political impact of the Tea Party " width="300"></a></p><p>While some pundits and politicians on the left have tried minimizing the Tea Party as an irrelevant sect in American politics, others on the left are saying otherwise.&nbsp; Media Matters, Daily Kos, and MSNBC have attacked the Tea Party as an unintelligent fringe group.</p><p>However, as those attacks continue, it’s definitely a surprise to see liberal publications like The New York Times acknowledge that the Tea Party could be the death knell of the current Washington establishment.&nbsp; The Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/us/politics/15teaparty.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that Tea Party candidates are running strong in Republican-leaning Congressional districts, as well as in other non-Republican districts.&nbsp; Their impact might be so strong that they’ll be enough of a force to push forward an agenda in both the House and the Senate in the new term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What's even more of a surprise is that the acknowledgement comes from Times reporter Kate Zernicke. Zernicke came <a href="http://bigjournalism.com/jmattera/2010/02/22/the-new-york-times-should-terminate-character-assassin-zernike/" rel="noopener noreferrer">under fire</a> earlier this year for her coverage of a speech by a former conservative activist at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.&nbsp; So, while the Times gets pounded by conservatives for biased coverage, it doesn’t completely take away their credibility in reporting the facts in certain cases.&nbsp;</p><p>The Washington Post, another left-leaning publication, recently published a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101303634.html?wprss=rss_nation&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+wp-dyn/rss/nation/index_xml+%28washingtonpost.com+-+Nation" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> discussing a fresh analysis of Tea Party signs at rallies.&nbsp; The analysis, conducted by UCLA student Emily Ekins, found that approximately a quarter of rally signs directed anger at the President and that racial content was not as widespread as depicted by other media outlets.&nbsp; Miss Ekins’s research found that the Tea Party’s message centered on limited government, liberty, lower taxes, fiscal responsibility, and free market capitalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The more accurate message of the movement itself is still getting out to voters, thanks to news outlets who adhere to the grand tradition of journalism.&nbsp; Negative Tea Party coverage, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2baxw_YScxc" rel="noopener noreferrer">exemplified</a> by CNN in the beginning of the movement, doesn’t seem to have distanced voters from embracing it as a genuine grassroots effort. In fact, the Tea Party has polled relatively well with mainstream voters.&nbsp;</p><p>While certain candidates within the Tea Party movement have been prone to gaffes, the Tea Party itself hasn’t really suffered any measurable damage from these setbacks.&nbsp; Perhaps the reason lies in the fact that&nbsp; voters are tired of politicians who think they’re entitled to political power.&nbsp; The true test comes in 18 days, when we find out whether a true people-driven revolution has arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span><br></span></p>
