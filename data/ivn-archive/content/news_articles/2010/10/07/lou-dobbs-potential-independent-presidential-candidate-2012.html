Nevertheless, pro-choice, anti-gun control, and a staunch critic of the $700 billion Wall St bailout, Dobbs could appeal to Democrats, Independents, and Republicans on a variety of different issues.</p><p>His views on corporate special interests, trade, manufacturing, foreign policy, and abortion could appeal to a large number of Democrats.&nbsp; His views on budget and trade deficits, bailouts, and border security could attract a fair number of Republicans.&nbsp; And his reputation for bashing both parties could prove enticing to the rapidly growing number of Independents.</p><p>At the present time, Dobbs has not ruled out a Presidential bid in 2012.&nbsp; With recent polls showing over 50% of Americans in favor of a viable third party, "Mr. Independent" himself could possibly mount a serious Ross Perot-style, reform-oriented campaign.</p>
