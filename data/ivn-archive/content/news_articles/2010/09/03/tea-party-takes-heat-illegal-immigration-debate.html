This so much so that the Tea Party’s stance on the issue is still stirring conversation within writing circles of prominent political magazines.&nbsp; As such, the left continues to deride the Tea Party’s stance on the issue, labeling their stance as racist.&nbsp;</p><p>John A. Farrell of <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> <a href="http://politics.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/john-farrell/2010/09/02/Will-Tea-Party-Acknowledge-That-Illegal-Immigration-Has-Dropped.html%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that illegal immigration is currently down and then used this opportunity to attack the Tea Party as a racist element, saying that we can:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “study what enforcement methods are most effective, and otherwise use our brains to come up with an immigration policy that builds on this progress, or we can ignore the evidence that things are improving and keep whining and moaning about taking our country back from dark skinned babies. After all, it feels so good to be stupid.”&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side of the political aisle, the issue isn't really about race at all, according to conservative commentator Jim Bender who calls the racism charge “irrational.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Who in their right mind would learn about such criminals entering the U.S. and yet do nothing to secure the border? What is the ulterior motive of the groups trying to end the immigration debate by crying racism?,” he <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Jim+Bender%3A+It%27s+not+racist+to+want+to+control+the+border&amp;articleId=52f18b2b-1ebd-44bc-aaf4-8013ecec46cc" rel="noopener noreferrer">asks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Agree or disagree, the Tea Party is certainly driving the conversation on some of the most pertinent issues of the day, giving a glimpse into how effective the movement has become.</p>
