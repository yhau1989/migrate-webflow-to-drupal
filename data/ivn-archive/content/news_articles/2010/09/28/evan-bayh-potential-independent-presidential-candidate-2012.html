Referred to as a 'Centrist Democrat', 'Blue Dog Democrat', or 'Moderate Democrat', Senator Bayh (D-Indiana) claimed that his retirement was largely due to intense frustration over the partisan-fueled gridlock in DC.&nbsp; Others, however, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/horseraceblog/2010/02/on_evan_bayhs_withdrawal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">believe</a> that he merely wanted to avoid facing a brutal re-election campaign.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bayh, considered a more independent-minded Democrat with a <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Evan_Bayh.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">mixed voting record</a>, warned that growing anger with the poor performance and hyper-partisanship of both major parties possessed the potential to generate a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/17/evan-bayh-predicts-third_n_466620.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">legitimate third party contender</a> in the 2012 presidential election.&nbsp; Predictably, speculation immediately surfaced that Bayh himself may have already been quietly considering such a bid, but thus far, he appears to be opposed to the prospect of such an effort.</p><p>Having served as the Governor of Indiana and as a more centrist-oriented Senator, some would argue that Bayh would possess the necessary clout and experience to mount an Independent bid.&nbsp; A Bayh campaign could conceivably draw significant interest from more liberal Republicans, Independents, and moderate Democrats, but would likely face stiff resistance from right-leaning Republicans and progressive Democrats.</p><p>At this stage, it appears unlikely that Bayh will launch an Independent third party bid, but in politics, anything is possible, especially when over 50% of Americans seem ready to ditch the two-party duopoly.&nbsp;</p>
