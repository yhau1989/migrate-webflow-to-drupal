<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/stephen_colbert.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://stephen_colbert.jpg" title="Stephen Colbert's immigration testimony before Congress has California connection" width="300"></a></p><p>Political theater literally arrived at Washington DC thanks to a free comedic act from faux news man Stephen Colbert last week.&nbsp; And if there’s anyone to thank for Colbert’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1T75jBYeCs" rel="noopener noreferrer">appearance</a> on Capitol Hill regarding immigration policy, it would be Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), from California’s 16th congressional district in the San Jose and Silicon Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Being the quintessential entertainer, Colbert used Lofgren’s invitation to slip into his Comedy Central character, modeled after Fox News pundit Bill O’Reilly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colbert’s monologue made a mockery of the conservative illegal immigration position, portraying conservatives as being ultimately anti-immigrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want a tomato picked by a Mexican. I want it picked by an American, then sliced by a Guatemalan and served by a Venezuelan in a spa where a Chilean gives me a Brazilian. Because my great-grandfather did not travel across 4,000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean to see this country overrun by immigrants," Colbert sarcastically told the subcommittee at one point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Colbert’s stunt may have been a delight to some Democrats who voted for the recent DREAM Act, because he painted Republicans as incompetent on the immigration front.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Colbert’s appearance shows that a new low has been achieved when it comes to having a civil and thoughtful dialogue on a serious issue like illegal immigration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to Rep. Lofgren, bringing in Colbert seems to be an act of political suicide for her party, opening a can of worms the Democratic Party cannot afford this close to the November elections.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the “experience” factor. The Congresswoman contacted Colbert because of his one-day stint as a farm field worker.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a comedian’s brief time as a farm field worker is a measuring stick of what it means to have good insight on illegal immigration, then this is a pretty frightening indication of what Establishment congresspersons constitute as “experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp; It certainly begs the question: What “experts” are they contacting on other issues pertinent to the United States at this point in time?&nbsp;</p><p>Colbert’s appearance is also demonstrates that Republicans are not the only Establishment party in Washington plagued by internal division over seeking solutions for illegal immigration.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a concrete example of the Democrats' disjointed voice on illegal immigration, consider that the House’s Democratic leadership was divided over allowing Colbert to speak at the subcommittee hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D- Calif.) thought testimony by Colbert would be “appropriate” because he’s an “American,” reported the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/sc-dc-colbert-hoyer-20100926,0,6597387.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; speaking on Fox News, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the second ranking Democrat in the House, said that the testimony would not be appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hearing itself, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) asked the entertainer to leave because the comedian lacked expertise on immigration policy.&nbsp;</p><p>As a liberal, Colbert may be more lenient on immigration policy; however, the subcommittee allowing him to satirize the subject places a bad light on elected officials, portraying them as treating immigration reform far too lightly.<span></span></p>
