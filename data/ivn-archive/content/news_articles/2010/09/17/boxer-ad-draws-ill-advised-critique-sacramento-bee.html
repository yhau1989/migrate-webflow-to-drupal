This year, those programs receive more than $1.1 billion, serving 1.7 million children. <span>&nbsp;</span>But <a href="http://topics.sacbee.com/Boxer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boxer</a> engages in hyperbole by suggesting that all of those children would be on the streets or joining gangs if not for her efforts.”&nbsp;</p><p>The ad never claims that all of the kids would have chosen the gang alternative without her program, but it does say that a million kids are off the street.<span>&nbsp; </span>That in itself is a difficult-to-prove claim, albeit not unreasonable given that it’s just a little more than half of the kids receiving the services.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is actually the Sac Bee that is engaging in hyperbole by trying to find something wrong with a clearly accurate ad by Boxer.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of press criticism of a positive, accurate ad about an incumbent’s record seems likely to drive the Boxer campaign back into negative advertising.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the media is going to attack you for the <em>right</em> kind of advertising, you may as well start taking pot shots at your opponent.<span>&nbsp; </span>You couldn’t be portrayed much worse than you are in this piece of lazy journalism.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no such thing as a political ad that doesn’t overreach.<span>&nbsp; </span>But this Boxer ad seems about as accurate as you can get.<span>&nbsp; </span>It should be praised for its honesty, not criticized for the sake of fairness or for some other, more nefarious motive.</p>
