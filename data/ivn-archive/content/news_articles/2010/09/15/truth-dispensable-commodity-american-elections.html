The doubts that have been raised by these attacks are truly astonishing.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, a recent <a href="http://pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Growing-Number-of-Americans-Say-Obama-is-a-Muslim.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> showed that 20 percent of Americans believe Obama (a committed Christian) is a Muslim. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Among Republicans, that number reaches 34 percent, while more than 40 percent of Republicans doubt the <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/04/cnnopinion-research-poll-obama-birth/" rel="noopener noreferrer">president’s citizenship</a> – despite all evidence to the contrary.&nbsp;</p><p>A frequent argument of the anti-Obama crowd is that Democrats treated George W. Bush no differently during his term.<span>&nbsp; </span>But there was, in fact, a difference.<span>&nbsp; </span>When unproven allegations appeared about President Bush’s Air National Guard service, they were rebuffed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not only did the allegations disappear from the airwaves, so did the news people who made them (in particular, Dan Rather, one of the Big 3 network news anchors, who was fired by CBS).<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>A recent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0927/politics-socialism-capitalism-private-enterprises-obama-business-problem.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> in the estimable <em>Forbes Magazine</em> takes the innuendo about Obama to a new level of credibility by implying that the President’s formative years have made him a virtual foreigner no matter what his birth certificate may say.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to <em>The Atlantic</em>, Newt Gingrich <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/Charge-of-Kenyan-Anti-Colonial-Obama-Draws-Wide-Criticism-5001" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> this article “the most profound insight about I have read in the last six years about Barack Obama.”&nbsp;</p><p>The type of thinking that marks the <em>Forbes</em> article is much like "Palintology" (the thought process of the ex Alaska governor):<span>&nbsp; </span>to be a real American, you must pass a series of purity hurdles that would sidetrack many patriotic children of American servicemen and women and diplomats.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is this thinking that makes the United States far less of a world power and far more of an insular island in an increasingly global society.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is all just a case of one side’s much better ability to spin innuendo into belief. <span>&nbsp;</span>But I believe there’s something far more serious going on here.<span>&nbsp; </span>The American electorate’s voice is being drowned out by marketing techniques designed to undermine our own system of government.<span>&nbsp; </span>You don’t like the results of the last election?<span>&nbsp; </span>Spin loudly and effectively enough and you can erode confidence in the winning side.&nbsp;</p><p>Our treasured freedom of speech and expression provides all of us with the privilege of saying almost anything with impunity – especially when we’re discussing public figures.<span>&nbsp; </span>No one wants to see that right abridged. <span>&nbsp;</span>But holding our public figures, politicians and media organizations accountable for telling the truth is something we should all demand.</p>
