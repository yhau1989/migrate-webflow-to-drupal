And it is not unreasonable to wonder whether, in many cases, even media and polling organizations, whose job it is to follow the political process and inform <span><span>public opinion</span></span>, are aware that there are third party and Independent candidates for office at all levels of government across the nation. &nbsp;The media appear most likely to report on a third party or Independent candidate only if that individual is a former Democrat or Republican – as the examples of <span><span>Charlie Crist</span></span> in Florida, <span><span>Tom Tancredo</span></span> in Colorado, and Tim Cahill in Massachusetts demonstrate. &nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, even when they are aware of the third party and Independent candidates in a given race, the mainstream media appear reluctant to cover them, as if it were of little or no importance to inform the public of the candidates who will appear on our November ballots. &nbsp;As I have demonstrated here before, media organizations often seem to even collude with Democratic and Republican candidates to exclude third party and Independent candidates from <span><span>public debates</span></span> and forums. The <span><span>Socialist Party candidate</span></span> for US Senate in <span><span>Ohio</span></span>, Dan La Botz, has gone so far as to file a formal <a href="http://thirdpartydaily.blogspot.com/2010/09/oh-la-botz-charges-ohio-newspaper.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaint against the Ohio Newspaper Organization</a> for excluding him from debates and forums, arguing that the arbitrary exclusion amounts to an illegal campaign contribution to the Democratic and Republican nominees.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider, furthermore, the wording of the polling questions mentioned above. &nbsp;The NYT/CBS News poll queried: “Some people say the country needs a third political party – a new party to compete with the Democratic and Republican parties. Do you agree or disagree?” &nbsp;The Fox News poll asked: “do you think it would be a good idea or a bad idea if a third national political party were formed that would run candidates for president, congress and state offices against the Republican and Democratic candidates?” &nbsp;The very grammar of the questions presupposes that there are currently no third parties in the United States, that there are no alternatives to the Republicans and Democrats. &nbsp;The <span><span>Gallup polling</span></span> report and analysis is even more telling when it concludes by stating that, “while <em>the formation of an official third party is not imminent</em>, that desire may be manifested in voters’ strong anti-incumbent sentiments this year” (emphasis added). &nbsp;One would think that a survey devoted to polling public sentiment regarding third parties would ask respondents about their stance toward actual, existing third parties, rather than presume that no such parties currently exist. &nbsp;</p><p>Is it any wonder that the wider public is unaware of alternatives to the Republicans and Democrats?&nbsp;</p>
