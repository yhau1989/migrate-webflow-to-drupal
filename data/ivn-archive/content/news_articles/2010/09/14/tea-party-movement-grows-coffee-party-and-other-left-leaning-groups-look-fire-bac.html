It will be intriguing to see how much the Tea Party can chip away from the Democratic vote in California come the <span><span>2010 midterm elections</span></span>.&nbsp; After all, the Tea Party’s message overall has been able to attract<br> some Independents and and even a small number of disillusioned Democrats. California’s <span><span>budget crisis</span></span> might also heavily factor into this "tea’d off" electorate.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the preliminary impact can already be seen. Carly Fiorina, the candidate whom Tea Party icon Sarah Palin endorsed, is <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/09/07/poll-fiorina-boxer-still-in-dead-heat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">polling in a dead heat</a> with <span><span>incumbent Senator Barbara Boxer</span></span>.&nbsp; With one of the Tea Party’s goals being to clean up Congress, capturing a senate seat away from a career politician like <span><span>Barbara </span><span>Boxer</span></span> would demonstrate that the Tea Party’s sentiments are spilling across <span><span>party lines</span></span> and can very much break the Democratic establishment's stronghold in California.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the groups at the wheel of generating momentum for the Tea Party in California is the <span><span>Northern California chapter</span></span> of the <em>Tea Party Patriots</em>. The Tea Party Patriots alone has several chapters throughout the country. An interesting aspect about this particular NorCal group is found in their <a href="http://www.nctpp.net/who-are-we.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">mission statement</a>, which claims that they are the only group in the <span><span>national Tea Party movement</span></span> that’s not a Political Action Committee (PAC).&nbsp; As a non-partisan group not taking monetary contributions from either official Republican nor Democratic outlets, this factor also may prove instrumental in drawing Independents to their side and ushering in a whole new class of candidates come November.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, while the <span><span>Tea Party movement</span></span> seems to continue gaining strength, alternatives to the Tea Party movement seem to be quite weak.&nbsp; For instance, while the Coffee Party may have skyrocketed to nearly 300,000 members on their<br> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/coffeeparty?ref=ts" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span>Facebook</span></span> group</a>, they have yet to hold a rally as big as the recent 9/12 events or even as large as the Glenn<br> Beck “Restoring Honor” rally held in D.C. just a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the Coffee Party will have their chance to prove their strength when they host their first major convention from September 24-26. Furthermore, the Left as a whole will have another chance to show the power of their<br> grassroots movement when they host a <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/09/01/labor-and-liberal-groups-to-hold-oct-2-rally-on-mall-to-counter-beck-tea-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DC rally</a> of their own on October 2 of this year.</p>
