<p>Beginning in the early 1990s, the U.S. experienced a dramatic reduction in teen pregnancy and birth rates.&nbsp; As the country was ravaged by HIV/AIDS, the federal government, states and communities doubled-down their efforts to ensure young people everywhere received comprehensive sex education to protect them from contracting this deadly disease.&nbsp; As&nbsp; condom use and other forms of birth control skyrocketed among sexually active teens, and as young people began delaying sexual activity, the country experienced something unexpected – rapid declines in teen pregnancy and birth rates, particularly among Black teens.</p><p>That was then.</p><p>In the 2000s the progress that had been made began to stall as the federal government pumped nearly $2 billion of tax-payer money, including millions in California, into programs that promoted abstinence, not contraception, as the primary method of preventing pregnancy and the spread of disease.&nbsp; The first positive trend to reverse course was condom and other contraceptive use among teens.&nbsp; Now we are seeing the rise in teen pregnancy and births for the <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">first time</a> since 1990.</p><p>Abstinence-only advocates argue that people who don’t engage in sexual intercourse don’t get pregnant or contract disease.&nbsp; While that is medically accurate, more than 90 percent of young people will engage in intercourse before they reach 20-years old.&nbsp; And despite the fact that the average American marries for the first time in their mid-twenties, abstinence-only advocates continue to maintain that sexual intercourse should only occur within marriage.&nbsp; Encouraging young people to wait “until they are ready” is important.&nbsp; However, to promote programs that deny young people information about the effectiveness of condoms and other forms of birth control can, in fact, be dangerous to young people’s health and well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Abstinence-only vs. contraception is not the choice.&nbsp; Funding programs that work vs. programs that do not work is the choice.&nbsp; And in that case, the scientific evidence is clear - programs that only promote abstinence simply do not work.&nbsp; Recent research out of the University of Washington showed that young people who attended abstinence-only programs had the same pregnancy rates as young people who never had any sex education.&nbsp; On the other hand, young people who received comprehensive sex education that discussed contraception as well as delaying sexual activity had <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2004293974_sexed20m.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">half</a> the teen pregnancies as compared to their abstinence-only counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, parents overwhelmingly support comprehensive sex education, particularly here in California.&nbsp; A 2007 <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3916707.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> showed that 89% of California parents support comprehensive sex education as compared to 11% who support abstinence-only programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It would be easy for the cable news pundits and their guests to get in a war of words about this alarming reversal in teen pregnancy and birth rates.&nbsp; However, these statistics represent real young women whose opportunities to lead successful lives have virtually vanished.&nbsp; Our challenge now is to follow the evidence and re-double our efforts to ensure that all young people receive the information they need to make informed decisions so they can lead healthy and productive lives.</p>
