<p>According to the latest economic <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/2440527.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecast</a>, California has exited the worst of the Great Recession, but faces another two years of a long, slow, and painful recovery. &nbsp;Jeff Michael, of the University of Pacific, has officially declared the recession to be over, based on certain economic metrics, but stated, "It's going to feel like a recession for awhile longer." &nbsp;LA economist, Chris Thornberg added, "In the long run, recovery in California is going to be solid..In the short run, it's going to be weak."</p>
<p>While job losses appear to have bottomed out, home prices appear to have ended their skid, and the manufacturing base appears to have rebounded a bit, high unemployment, an extremely weak residential housing market, a continuing crisis in commercial real estate, and $20 billion budget deficits will likely plague the golden state for another two years. &nbsp;Some economists are even warning of a "double dip" recession, similar to that of the second, major downturn during the Great Depression in 1937.</p>
<p>It's far too early to assess whether or not California, or the United States for that matter, is entering a genuine recovery. &nbsp;Brief turnarounds and powerful bear market rallies occurred during the Great Depression and the early 1980s recession, only to falter months or years later. 2010 is a make or break year for the state, national, and global economy. &nbsp;As massive government stimulus programs run their course by mid-year, a fragile economy will face its most daunting challenge yet. &nbsp;</p>
