<p><span>I know what you’re thinking.&nbsp; “Who doesn’t want world peace?” Even Sandra Bullock in the movie “Miss Congeniality” wanted world peace.&nbsp; Leaders the world over are always calling for world peace.</span></p><p><span>Not me.&nbsp; I’ll take common courtesy.&nbsp; World peace is too broad to achieve and too nebulous a thought.&nbsp; It has to start somewhere and with me, that is in the mirror. &nbsp;The act of courtesy costs nothing and makes a world of difference.&nbsp; Remember the last time you allowed a car into the lane front of you, or held a door open for someone?&nbsp; Often, you will receive a quick wave of thanks or a smile of gratitude for something that cost you nothing.</span></p><p><span>I’m no doctor, but I’m sure my blood pressure goes down after helping someone.&nbsp; That smile of appreciation after helping someone load groceries into their car or changing a flat tire makes my day.&nbsp; I can’t speak for the other person, but I’m sure it lifts their spirits and makes their day, too.&nbsp; They may even be inspired to “pay it forward” and offer a little assistance or courtesy to someone else. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In Haiti, our military is currently helping people who desperately need it.&nbsp; Hundreds of people are mobilizing to provide assistance to those in need.&nbsp; I’m sure the hours are long and hard but the satisfaction of being able to offer real help during such a crisis is unmatched.&nbsp; I can’t speak for the Haitian people, as I’m sure no words can capture the feeling of restored hope knowing that people around the world truly care. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We can’t all go to Haiti.&nbsp; We are not all doctors, or nurses, or members of search and rescue teams.&nbsp; But we all work and live near people in need.&nbsp; Your elderly neighbor needs her grass cut, so cut it.&nbsp; The young mother with a stroller and armful of packages needs a door held open, so hold it.&nbsp; The man by the freeway ramp needs a warm meal, so feed him.&nbsp; The list is endless.&nbsp; There are limitless ways for you to have a direct and lasting impact on someone in need, especially during these tough economic times.</span></p><p><span>It begins at home, with you, your wife and children.&nbsp; Lead by example.&nbsp; Earn the phrase “S/he is Trustworthy”.&nbsp; How many times do we send “leaders” to Sacramento or to Washington DC whom you wouldn’t even allow to babysit your children?&nbsp;Most of these "leaders" don't lead by example, so we as citizens must bear the responsibility first and foremost.</span></p><p><span>This is a call to action, America.&nbsp; If we want to be world leaders, respected around the globe, then we must walk the walk, not just talk to talk.&nbsp; Seek and you shall find. &nbsp;Look for those opportunities to exercise common courtesy and compassion right here at home.&nbsp; World peace doesn’t begin in board rooms or at global summits.&nbsp; It begins in the mirror. It begins with ME!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
