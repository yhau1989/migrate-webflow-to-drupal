<p>Despite recent electoral events in Massachusetts, California Democrats voted to push forward a highly controversial proposal to establish a single-payer, state-run healthcare system. Governor Schwarzenegger has twice vetoed similar proposals and vows to veto it a third time if a bill hits his desk before his term expires.</p><p>Proponents <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/21/BAAN1BLNTP.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">argue</a> that Democratic inaction and electoral results in Massachusetts merit a robust state response. &nbsp;In other words, if the Federal Government won't reform healthcare and provide a sensible public option, then states will have to take matters into their own hands, much like Massachusetts did in 2006 with its nearly universal coverage. &nbsp;State Senator, Mark Leno, stated, "We always wished there would be single-payer reform in Washington, but given the reality that that's not going to happen, it's not going to deter us from the pursuit of single-payer in this state." &nbsp;State Senator, Christine Kehoe, also argued that a single payer system would not exacerbate the state's crushing budget deficit.</p><p>However, some Democratic proponents of a single-payer system are fearful of the potential political repercussions in November, in a replay of Brown's recent upset victory in Massachusetts. &nbsp;Steven Maviglio, a consultant, said, "this is not the time to do it...Anyone who has read a newspaper in the last 24 hours knows this will not help the Democrats in November and it could hurt them." &nbsp;He then added that the timing would be right when "the state isn't billions in debt." Republicans were just as blunt. &nbsp;State Senator, Tony Strickland, stated, "I believe the Democrats in Sacramento just don't get it. &nbsp;This was literally 48 hours after the most liberal state in the country voted down Obamacare. &nbsp;They are not listening to the people in the state or the country."</p><p>While the timing and spirit of the vote may be politically questionable, it could inspire California's extensive liberal base unlike in Massachusetts, where independents played a much more pivotal role. Democrats, who dominate the golden state's political landscape, could choose to rally the troops and put it all on the line over healthcare this year. &nbsp;This "all or nothing" approach could either spectacularly backfire or ignite a fire under the state's substantial liberal wing. &nbsp;Progressive Democrat, Marcy Winograd, who is challenging Blue Dog Democrat, Jane Harman, applied a similar logic in her recent <a href="http://www.winograd4congress.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131%3Awinograd-urges-democratic-leadership-to-come-back-strong-&amp;catid=1%3Ain-the-news&amp;Itemid=165&amp;lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> stating, "This upset reflects less the zeal of a million conservative voters than the fact that two million Massachusetts Democrats stayed home, rejecting the politics of Democratic Party appeasement."</p><p>And here's another issue to consider, even for those who staunchly oppose any sort of public option or state-run, single payer system. &nbsp;Besides the prospect of unsustainable <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/health/policy/16mass.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">costs</a>, as is already rearing its head in the Massachusetts healthcare system, the issue of states' rights should not be casually dismissed. &nbsp;Many who argue against "Obamacare" often state that healthcare should not be a federal issue in the constitutional sense; instead, it should be left to each state in accordance with the Tenth Amendment. In light of the Tenth Amendment, then, the issue of a single-payer healthcare system is perfectly legitimate for Californians to carefully and thoughtfully consider. &nbsp;Those who advocate states' rights should view the debate as a welcome Constitutional development, and an opportunity to engage in a substantive, intellectual discussion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
