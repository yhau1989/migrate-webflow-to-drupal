<p><span>Haiti’s tragic events could happen anywhere in the world.&nbsp; Some estimate the 7.0 earthquake could reach a final death toll of nearly 200,000 individuals.&nbsp; In addition, Haiti’s capital city, Port-au-Prince, has been ravished due to poor building design and construction.</span></p><p> </p><p>Not only is Haiti one of the poorest countries in the world, but according to the <a href="http://transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, it is also one of the most corrupt ranking near the bottom at number 168. &nbsp;In contrast the United States is ranked only 19th<sup> </sup>on the same corruption index and although our national debt is hovering around $12 trillion, we still are considered a wealthy nation.&nbsp; In fact, if the state of California was an independent nation, we would be considered the 8<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the world (though that status is <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/28/china-california-down" rel="noopener noreferrer">falling</a>).</p><p> </p><p>But with a historically rising 12.2% state unemployment rate and a $68 billion public debt, our financial foundation is weakening.&nbsp; In fact, with the increasing unemployment rates, home foreclosures are reaching <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9557402" rel="noopener noreferrer">record highs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Of course economic woes cannot compare to the thousands of lost lives from the devastating earthquake.&nbsp; However, Haiti is an alarming reminder that a nation needs a solid foundation to endure the unexpected tragedies in life.&nbsp; Although America did prevail in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attack, our nation was indeed stronger back in 2001.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>If California was rocked with another Northridge type earthquake, would our state recover?&nbsp; The Northridge earthquake was one of the costliest natural disasters in US History with an estimated $20 billion in damages alone.&nbsp; The quake literally shut down the Los Angeles region stopping business and production.&nbsp; In addition hospitals, schools, media, radio and freeways were affected.&nbsp; The entire infrastructure was stressed but eventually the city recovered.</p><p> </p><p>But 15 years ago, even in a recession, Californians enjoyed higher than the national average in employment <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/1995/010195_calguide/cgep1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">wages</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although our state debt and borrowing began to dig us in a hole back in the 90’s, we still did not have the overly explosive debt, plus overwhelming population that we do today.&nbsp; If we continue on this financial road, then the next natural disaster could devastate California in a similar manner as Haiti. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>How then, do we prepare for and prevent such a fate?&nbsp; We must repair the financial damage by implementing the following ten measures: &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>1. &nbsp;Ending state welfare benefits for illegal immigrants</p><p> </p><p>2. &nbsp;Abolishing AB 32 which will end the regulations killing state businesses</p><p> </p><p>3. &nbsp;Allowing water to flow through the Central Valley to prosper our state’s agriculture</p><p> </p><p>4. &nbsp;Reverse the high business taxes and strict regulations that have chased both business and production out of our once Golden State.</p><p> </p><p>5. &nbsp;Return the legislature to a part-time status</p><p> </p><p>6. &nbsp;Investigate wasteful spending and create solutions</p><p> </p><p>7. &nbsp;Sell state parks back to the private sector</p><p> </p><p>8. &nbsp;Wrangle down the power of public employee unions stifling our state</p><p> </p><p>9. &nbsp;Force sanctuary cities to utilize their own resources instead of state’s resources for breaking the law.</p><p> </p><p>10. &nbsp;Support small businesses and legal California workers</p><p> </p><p>In addition to these ten solutions, we must implement a state-owned banking system like North Dakota has established.&nbsp; Due to their <a href="http://www.banknd.nd.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">state bank</a>, North Dakota is not experiencing an economic downturn or high unemployment rate like the rest of the nation.&nbsp; Since California is considered a bad debt now, a state bank would allow us to create our own credit, deposit our funds, and return profits into the public system.&nbsp; Since California is still one of the largest economies in&nbsp;the world, our state could run independent of the increasing national economic crisis while strengthening our own foundation.</p><p> </p><p>As we pray, hope, and donate to Haiti, we cannot forget that earthquakes are part of California life.&nbsp; We need to ensure that our structure and economy sit on a solid foundation.</p><div><span><br></span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>
