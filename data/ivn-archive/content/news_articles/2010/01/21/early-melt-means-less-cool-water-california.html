<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/earlymelt.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="200" src="cloudinary://earlymelt.jpg" title="earlymelt" width="300"></a>The Sierras are in the midst of a series of major storms expected to add significant depth to the winter snowpack.&nbsp; And in case you think that’s just ho-hum information, here’s a fact you might find more compelling:&nbsp; the Sierra snowpack provides 60 percent of Southern California’s water.&nbsp; Agriculture, recreation and life in general could be affected by the continuing drought that has plagued California for at least the past four years.&nbsp; And according to one Weather Channel report last week, the current set of storms packs enough of a wallop to actually end the drought and refill our reservoirs.</p>

<p>But the role of the Sierra snowpack is more significant to our eco-system than determining whether or not we can water our lawns.&nbsp; Because of an effect called “albedo,” which is the ratio of sunlight that reflects off of a land surface, the condition and size of the snowpack impacts climate change, and, conversely, climate change impacts the condition and size of the snowpack.</p>

<p>A 2009 study by the California Climate Change Center authored by physicists and climate experts from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, UCLA and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction concluded that a five percent increase in snow albedo can result in as much as a 30 percent reduction in the amount of total spring and summer runoff.&nbsp; The report also showed that man-made carbon emissions, which can be measured as black carbon deposits on the snow, have a major impact on snow albedo.</p>

<p>Carbon reduces the percent of sunlight reflecting off the snow surface, hence increasing the amount absorbed into the ground.&nbsp; The warming resulting from less reflection reduces the snowpack size and results in lower levels of runoff.&nbsp; Ensuing political battles over water needed by industry and agriculture have become the stuff of legends (and movies) for decades in California.</p>

But this report offers great promise, because it makes clear that premature snow melt is at least partially the fault of man’s actions.&nbsp; The report stated that “reduced snow albedo that can occur by the increase in local emissions and subsequent b[lack] c[arbon]&nbsp;deposit[s] on the Sierra Nevada snowpack can enhance earlier snowpack depletion. This will further reduce warm season water resources and add to the effects of the low-level warming induced by increased greenhouse gases.”&nbsp; In other words, man is part of the problem, and can become part of the solution.

<p>In the war of words over global warming, few examples of real science are cited – perhaps because the real science is so difficult to read and understand.&nbsp; This report provides such science, as well as a pragmatic reason to reduce man-made carbon emissions before the state finds itself unable to slake its thirst.</p>
