<p>Later today, Governor Schwarzenegger will unveil yet another budget plan sure to make everyone cringe. &nbsp;After closing last year's $26 billion deficit through accounting gimmicks, tax hikes, and spending cuts, the state is facing a <a href="http://www.presstelegram.com/breakingnews/ci_14113064" rel="noopener noreferrer">$21 billion</a> deficit over the next 18 months. While the governor has declared budget cuts in the education sector off-limits, lawmakers and pundits are <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_14147545?source=rss&amp;nclick_check=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicting</a> painful cuts in health &amp; human services, and possibly the state payroll.</p>
<p>Since 2003, the story has changed very little. &nbsp;The state borrows and spends too much, and tax revenues continue to precipitously drop. Quick fixes, accounting tricks, tax hikes, and partial spending cuts often provide a short-term solution, but the root cause of California's fiscal woes remains and worsens with each passing year. &nbsp;Add in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the golden state is rapidly approaching the financial abyss.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during the bubble years, California foolishly borrowed and spent at a dizzying pace, instead of allocating even a modest percentage to savings for a rainy day. &nbsp;Much like Wall St and the American consumer, California was deceived by the allure of a rising stock market, artificial housing boom, and cheap credit. &nbsp;But, it proved to be a foundation built upon sand. &nbsp;Things were too easy, too convenient, and too painless. &nbsp;Fiscal success required no discipline.</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, California and the rest of the nation have come to learn that solid economies are not built on negative savings rates, a lack of production, artificially low interest rates, a weak Dollar, and insatiable deficit spending. &nbsp;At some point, payday comes, and the consequences of excess borrowing, spending, and speculating unleash untold pain and suffering.</p>
<p>As a result, drastic changes are needed to save California from a 10 year Recession/Depression. &nbsp;Worldviews must change, business as usual must immediately be scrapped, and quick fixes must be vigorously opposed. &nbsp;Is Sacramento up to the challenge? &nbsp;More importantly, are We the People up to the challenge?</p>
<p>We're soon going to find out.</p>
