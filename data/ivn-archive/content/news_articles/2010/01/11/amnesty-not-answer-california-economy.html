<p>Amnesty would provide the United States with a "foundation for robust, just, and widespread economic growth" according to Chicano Studies Professor Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda. In his <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/raising_the_floor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> for the Center for American Progress, Dr. Hinojosa-Ojeda cited that comprehensive immigration reform would benefit both the American worker and the American economy.</p><p>It's highly doubtful legal American citizens will agree with the professor since the US unemployment rate is currently <a href="http://www.thedailymiddle.com/2009/12/22/nouriel-roubini-says-real-unemployment-rate-is-17-5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">17.5%</a> (including those who are part-time, but desire full-time employment and those who have given up searching for a job). &nbsp;In fact, Bloomberg <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;sid=aHA4PMI1G2ks" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicts</a> that the labor force will probably grow this year, creating an even higher unemployment rate.</p><p>After the 1986 amnesty, American taxpayers accrued $78.7 billion in additional taxes over the next <a href="http://www.nomoreamnesty.com/stake.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">decade</a>. &nbsp;Furthermore, in a violation of civil rights, Black Americans are disproportionately the highest affected legal worker due to a mass undocumented labor force. &nbsp;Leading immigration economist, George Borjas of Harvard University, proved that illegal immigration cut wages by $1800 per year for those Americans in the low-skilled <a href="http://cis.org/blackamericans" rel="noopener noreferrer">labor market</a>.</p><p>California happens to be home to the nation's largest illegal alien population. &nbsp;Today, the golden state is experiencing a statewide depression while facing over $68 billion in public debt. &nbsp;In contrast to the American Progress report, I would submit that amnesty is not the solution for the California economy. &nbsp;An alternative solution would be ending all public benefits for illegal aliens. &nbsp;The education, medical care, and incarceration of illegal aliens <a href="http://www.fairus.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=16861&amp;security=1601&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1017" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> California taxpayers at least $10.5 billion annually. &nbsp;And LA County Supervisor, Michael Antonovich, reported that illegal aliens drained county residents of $1 billion per year in welfare benefits alone.</p><p>As illegal immigrants continue to pour into our state, California's unemployment is over 12% and rising. &nbsp;Our state's economy cannot handle the huge volume of undocumented workers. &nbsp;Americans need jobs.</p><p>By ending public benefits in a work depression, illegal immigrants will be forced to return to their homelands which would open up employment opportunities for legal California residents. &nbsp;In addition, our state would save billions of dollars in expense, laying a foundation for a robust, just, and sustained economic growth for the American worker and California economy.</p>
