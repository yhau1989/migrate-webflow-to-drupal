<p><span>Widespread political discontent with the powers in charge is nothing unique these days, being an almost hip, countrywide trend.</span></p><p><span><br><br>According to the most recent&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/113980/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Job-Approval.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup Poll</a>,</span>&nbsp;the country as a whole holds a subpar 48% job&nbsp;<span>approval rating</span>&nbsp;of President Obama.</span></p><p><span><br><br>As the administration stumbles in limbo and strategizes to win back the&nbsp;<span>American people</span>’s confidence, it will be a while before any significant and positive shift in Obama’s relationship with the public takes place (if any positive shift at all).</span></p><p><span><br><br>The president is even getting a chilly reception from California residents, who are traditionally and strongly supportive of the&nbsp;<span>Democratic Party</span>&nbsp;year after year.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br><br>According to a recent <a href="http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2321.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field Poll</a> conducted of a sampling of&nbsp;<span>Californians</span>, a similar disapproval trend seems to mirror national sentiment as a whole.</span></p><p><span><br><br>Coming off his wave of a 65% approval rating with Californians two months into office, the wave has now died down to 56% a year later. This particular approval rating of a sitting president is the lowest held by this state since&nbsp;<span>President Jimmy Carter</span>.</span></p><p><span><br><br>Among Obama’s weak policy areas are&nbsp;<span>domestic issues</span>, particularly the economy and healthcare.</span></p><p><span><br><br>Concerning the economy, 44% approve of his work while 50% disapprove. In the realm of healthcare, 53% of Californians disapprove of his job while 39% approve.</span></p><p><span><br><br>These are significant tidbits to consider given California’s reputation as one of the most liberal states of the union.</span></p><p><span><br><br>All, however, is not lost for Obama in the&nbsp;<span>Golden State</span>. The same Field poll demonstrates his ability to resonate with Californians via his foreign policy, both with his handling of&nbsp;<span>Afghanistan</span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<span>War on Terror</span>&nbsp;as a whole.</span></p><p><span><br><br>47% of Californians approve of the&nbsp;<span>Afghan war</span>&nbsp;versus 35% of disapproval. Californians expressed positive support for the War on Terror as well, even if it was by a slimmer margin. In this area, voters expressed approval by a 48% to 41% ratio.</span></p><p><span><br><br>From a&nbsp;<span>foreign policy perspective</span>, Obama’s standing remains in the positive with Californians. But, as the Field Poll implies, defense is not necessarily at the forefront of their minds at this moment.</span></p><p><span><br><br>The nation’s defense should never take a back seat. But if President Obama wants to gain and retain the confidence of Californians, he must also focus on providing a viable solution to the nation’s&nbsp;<span>economic collapse</span>.</span></p><p><span><br><br>With Governor Schwarzenegger incurring the perpetual <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/24/MNIR1BM9HF.DTL&amp;tsp=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrath</a> of voters for the state’s fiscal mess,&nbsp;President Obama risks the same downfall if he continues to adopt an&nbsp;<span>economic policy that does not produce tangible results</span>.</span></p><p><span><br><br>Voters are looking for a leader to set the tone for economic recovery. Perhaps the president will be able to provide an economic model that California can then adopt on a smaller scale.&nbsp;<br><br><br></span></p>
