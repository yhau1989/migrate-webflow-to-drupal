<p>With only one year left in office, Governor Schwarzenegger has set an ambitious agenda&nbsp;to salvage what many believe to be a disappointing tenure. &nbsp;The Governor aims to work with the Legislature and reform-minded organizations to achieve the following <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/2435459.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">goals</a>:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Balance a budget that is $21 billion in the hole, mainly through spending cuts in strategic areas</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Enact long-term changes to the state's muddled <a href="http://caivn.org/issue/california-tax-reform" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax structure</a></p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Establish a more substantial rainy day fund for economic downturns</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Advocate the <a href="http://caivn.org/issue/top-two-open-primary-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Two Open Primary</a> in an effort to generate more moderate candidates</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Convince voters to approve the $11.1 billion bond to revamp the state's aging water infrastructure</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Reform the state's public pension plan, which has $100 billion of unfunded liabilities through 2015</p>
<p>Skeptics abound as the Governor attempts to effect yet another plan that promises major political and fiscal reform. &nbsp;In 2003, Schwarzenegger campaigned as the candidate who would "end the crazy deficit spending" and change the way state government conducts business. &nbsp;Six years later, the state is mired in massive deficits, political polarization runs rampant, and both the Governor and Democratic-controlled legislature possess dismal approval ratings.</p>
<p>Independent voters are growing tired of the empty rhetoric, broken promises, and ineffective governance in Sacramento. &nbsp;Enslaved by special interests, the party regulars on both sides of the aisle continue to stifle meaningful economic and political reform. &nbsp;It will take radical, new ideas, novel solutions, and thinking outside the box to resuscitate a dying state, and it will take a rapidly growing grassroots movement bucking the trend of reelecting entrenched incumbents to fill the state capitol with a slate of fresh, new faces.</p>
