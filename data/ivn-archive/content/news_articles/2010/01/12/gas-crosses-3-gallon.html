<p>Already faced with 12% unemployment, California consumers are now facing rising prices at the pump. &nbsp;A year ago, when markets were collapsing, gas averaged $1.99 a gallon in the golden state, but have recently risen to $3.04. &nbsp;Nationally, gas averaged $1.78 a year ago, but have risen to $2.75 a gallon. Analysts state that a sharp rise in the price of crude oil is driving the steady ascent. &nbsp;Oil is more than $40 a barrel more expensive compared to a year ago.</p><p>Oil experts <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-gas12-2010jan12,0,6678660.story?track=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fbusiness+%28L.A.+Times+-+Business%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" rel="noopener noreferrer">claim</a> that supply and demand don't warrant such a rapid increase in the price of oil at this time. &nbsp;Fadel Gheit, oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., stated that the numbers are "a good example of prices disconnected with the fundamentals of supply and demand, as was the case 18 months ago when oil prices peaked above $147 a barrel." &nbsp;He went on to add that oil prices remain elevated "despite high inventories, weak demand, and the largest OPEC spare capacity in years..."</p><p>Some analysts believe China's rapid economic rebound, tensions over Iran's potential nuclear program, and attacks on Nigerian oil installations served as catalysts for oil speculators. &nbsp;Others assert that massive government spending and unprecedented money printing at the Federal Reserve have significantly weakened the value of the Dollar, contributing to oil's price rise.</p><p>If oil's and gasoline's respective price hikes continue, the California and US economies may enter a period known as stagflation. &nbsp;High unemployment, stagnant growth, and high prices ruled the day back in the 70s, and some prognosticators fear a similar scenario may already be materializing. &nbsp;However, other forecasters predict a significant decline in oil and other asset prices during the second half of the year, as stimulus funds run dry and economic reality sets back in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
