<p>Sacramento real estate appears to be ready for a recovery, and a return to more positive days, according an article in the&nbsp; Sacramento Bee.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/2492107.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> notes that area prices have fallen to near 2001 levels, thus making housing more competitive with higher cost markets such as the Bay Area and Los Angeles.&nbsp; The lower prices are once again attracting well-educated and highly skilled workers into the area, according to the Bee.</p><p>But Mike Gray, a senior Realtor with Lyon Realty in Folsom, says the story is a bit more complicated than the article indicates.&nbsp; First, he notes, the continuing double-digit unemployment rate is a barrier to growth in the region.&nbsp; “People don’t buy homes when they can’t get a job,” he said.&nbsp; Second, the real estate market still hasn’t settled down in all price ranges, and there remains some pain ahead.&nbsp; “Houses at a $350,000 or lower price point are now poised for some price appreciation, making them more attractive to buyers,” Gray explained.&nbsp;</p><p>But higher priced housing – especially homes above $450,000 -- can expect to take big hits this year, because foreclosures on jumbo loans have yet to reach their peak.&nbsp; “These homes often require jumbo mortgages ($475,000 and above), which are going for between 6 1/2 and 7 percent interest versus standard loans available for 4 7/8 to 5 percent interest.&nbsp; That difference amounts to substantially higher monthly payments,” he said.&nbsp; “And larger houses also cost more for heat, power and other utilities.&nbsp; It will take another two to three years to clear out troubled higher-priced properties found in communities such as Granite Bay, Eldorado Hills and Lincoln.”</p><p>The Sacramento region (including Yolo, Placer, Eldorado and Sacramento counties) was one of the worst hit locales in the nation during the housing crisis.&nbsp; And it’s a genuinely positive sign for the area that housing prices have ratcheted back to 2001 or 2002 levels.&nbsp; But Gray warns that other factors could also have an impact:&nbsp; “We’re no longer seeing the kinds of creative financing that caused the original problem, which means it’s harder to get a loan.”</p><p>The realty industry often referred to these financing schemes as “liar loans” because applications were not checked for factual accuracy.&nbsp; Such loans were at the heart of the housing bubble and subsequent meltdown.&nbsp; “We’ve returned to more rational loan methods now, which is good.&nbsp; But it has raised the bar on borrowers’ requirements.”</p><p>Gray notes that speculators with cash in hand have the advantage in the marketplace right now.&nbsp; “Investors with all cash are buying cheap and selling quickly for a huge profit,” he said.&nbsp; “Foreclosed properties, short sales, or negotiated deals made on the courthouse steps just ahead of the auction block can result in a bargain for the cash-rich buyer.&nbsp; But there’s risk as well – such as undisclosed tax liens on a property.”</p><p>To reduce the risk in buying such properties, Gray has one crucial tip:&nbsp; “If you’re the only person visiting a property, then back out.&nbsp; There’s probably something that’s waiting to come back and bite you.”&nbsp; There’s no question that California’s hard-hit housing market is on the mend, but we’re a long way from smooth sailing.&nbsp; Full confidence won’t return to the market until the job picture brightens.</p>
