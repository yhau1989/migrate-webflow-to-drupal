<p>US Senate candidate, Tom Campbell, issued a list of specific cuts he'd propose to restore fiscal sanity to an out of control the federal budget.&nbsp; However, the military budget was completely neglected.</p><p>Campbell offered a number of thought provoking assessments regarding the moral, fiscal, and security implications of gargantuan budget deficits and over $12 trillion of national debt.&nbsp; His <a href="http://www.campbell.org/news/campbell-gets-specific-on-cutting-federal-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposals</a> to use TARP money to pay down the debt,&nbsp; methodically cut welfare spending, slash the Dept. of Education, force Amtrak to compete in the free market, end corn ethanol subsidies, and cease bailout guarantees for Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac, will certainly receive high marks from fiscal conservatives, especially those in the GOP.&nbsp;</p><p>But, he failed to even mention the bloated military budget.&nbsp; In 2007, Robert Higgs, of the Independent Institute, calculated that America spends nearly <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1941" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 trillion</a> a year on its military, both at home and abroad.&nbsp; With the escalation in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094304575029504272764876.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yemen</a>, plus President Obama's latest <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20100113/D9D6RFGG1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">record</a> military budget, this two-year old figure has quite possibly passed $1 trillion annually.&nbsp; Consider the fact, too, that the federal government employs over <a href="http://theindependentforum.blogspot.com/2009/12/private-war-contractors-reaping-huge.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">200,000</a> private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Congress is <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/12/as_obama_sends_more_troops_giant_shadow_army_of_co.php?ref=fpb" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable</a> to estimate the true cost because of waste, fraud, and bureaucracy.&nbsp; Consider also, that the same defense contractors who sign lucrative contracts with the federal government, are actively arming some of the most <a href="http://theindependentforum.blogspot.com/2009/12/us-weapons-flowing-to-arab.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">oppressive regimes</a> in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why is it then, that the military budget is off limits to fiscal conservatives?&nbsp; Why is it that the military budget is off limits to President Obama, a Nobel Peace Prize winner whose proposed three-year federal spending freeze <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/26/obama-spending-freeze-chills-teacher" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not</a> apply to the military?&nbsp; Even Speaker Pelosi, a notorious big spender, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/pelosi-defense-pork-shoul_n_440389.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">recognizes</a> this clear cut contradiciton.</p><p>While most would recognize that national defense should be a top priority based on a simple reading of the Constitution, the fiscal contradiction of a $1 trillion budget would appear to be stark.&nbsp; The U.S. military, the intelligence community, Homeland Security, and private contractors are all, directly or indirectly, branches of the federal government.&nbsp; Therefore, fiscal conservatives, who often criticize the waste, inefficiency, and deficit production of virtually every other federal program, are making a seemingly contradictory "exception to the rule" with the military budget.&nbsp; Shouldn't it too be subjected to more fiscally conservative scrutiny?</p><p>Ironically, while Campbell presciently draws attention to our massive debt to China, he and other fiscal conservatives appear to miss a crucial point regarding <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/18/watershed-moment" rel="noopener noreferrer">China's rise</a> on the world stage.&nbsp; China, even with its quasi, but increasingly capitalistic system, is able to generate huge trade &amp; budget surpluses, national savings, a renowned manufacturing base, a more scientifically literate population, and a more robust military capability, precisely because it does not spend trillions on multiple, overseas wars and a global military presence.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps there is a critical lesson to be learned here.</p>
