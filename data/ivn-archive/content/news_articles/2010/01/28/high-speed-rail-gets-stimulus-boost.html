<p>Though far below the requested $4.7 billion, the state's high-speed rail project will receive $2.25 billion in federal stimulus funds to move ahead with construction.&nbsp; While the project is projected to be a boon for job creation and infrastructure development, key questions remain.</p><p>According to the California High-Speed Rail Authority, the stimulus injection will generate 160,000 construction-related jobs, as well as 450,000 permanent jobs upon completion.&nbsp; Ultimately, the high-speed rail project is projected to traverse 800 miles, connecting southern California to the Bay Area and Sacramento, and cost approximately $45 billion.&nbsp; Officials seek to commence construction by late 2012 and complete the project some time after 2017.</p><p>While <a href="http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2010/01/25/daily69.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">proponents</a> are hailing the stimulus boost as a necessary investment in the nation's ailing infrastructure, a catalyst for enduring job creation, and a tool for greater economic development, detractors are raising some thought-provoking questions.</p><p>For example, how much will California taxpayers have to eventually pay for this monolithic project, especially considering the state's crippling debt predicament?&nbsp; In late 2008, Californians approved nearly $10 billion in general obligation bonds, but a project of this magnitude will require tens of billions more.&nbsp;</p><p>How accurate are these job predictions?&nbsp; Remember Governor Schwarzenegger's overly optimistic jobs predictions early in his gubernatorial career?&nbsp; They <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/11/where-are-all-jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer">never materialized</a>.&nbsp; In addition, the Obama administration's stimulus predictions of no greater than 8% unemployment have been falsified as well.</p><p>How long will the project take to actually complete?&nbsp; Rail authority officials estimate, that by September 2017, the portion running from San Francisco to Anaheim will have been completed, but the utlimate objective is to extend the high-speed rail from San Diego all the way up to Sacramento.&nbsp; How many more years will that require?</p><p>And at the federal level, will DC continue to subsidize the states' rail projects, despite running $1.4 trillion deficits and spending $708 billion on <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/01/27/year-later-nation-polarized-partisanship" rel="noopener noreferrer">record military budgets</a>?&nbsp; After all, CA's high-speed rail project is projected to take at least 10 more years to complete.</p><p>These are just some of the critical questions being raised by those questioning the viability of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the latest investment in high-speed rail needs to be put in proper perspective.&nbsp; Last month, China unveiled the world's <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/28/china-california-down" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastest train</a> and has initiated construction on at least forty two more high-speed rail lines, expected to be complete by 2012.&nbsp; These rail lines will link underdeveloped regions with urban centers where industry and service are most prevalent.&nbsp; While the US is trumpeting its $8 billion investment in high-speed rail in several states, China is investing far more money and is on schedule to complete these massive infrastructure projects at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p><p>If California and the United States as a whole wish to remain competitive with the likes of China, perhaps they should raise their expectations and take a long, hard look at their budget priorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
