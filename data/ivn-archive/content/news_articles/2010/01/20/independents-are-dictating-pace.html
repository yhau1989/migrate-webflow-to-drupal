<p>Independent voters continue to set the tone across America. &nbsp;In last night's upset GOP victory in the Massachusetts special election, independents made their presence felt as they shocked the Democratic establishment. &nbsp;This is a <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/11/11/gallup-poll-shows-seismic-shift-independent-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">trend</a> that commenced with GOP gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/ol_20100120_1862.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>, and many pundits posit that unless the economy begins a definitive recovery over the next six to eight months, it may produce a powerful anti-Democratic backlash in the November mid-terms.</p><p>In 2006 and 2008, independents repudiated the GOP by sweeping Democrats into a majority in Congress and into the White House. &nbsp;However, a severe recession, high unemployment, the prospect of a $1+ trillion healthcare bill, and an accelerated explosion in the national debt have soured independent voters. The question is, will independent voters merely vote in establishment Republicans to punish Democrats, or will they spark a game-changing <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/31/2nd-american-revolution-its-way" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolution</a> that challenges both major parties?</p><p>For California, the outlook looks much the same. &nbsp;Independent voters figure to play a <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/29/independent-voters-could-decide-2010-elections" rel="noopener noreferrer">pivotal</a> role in the 2010 elections, and according to the latest <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/20/BAKF1BKJJC.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field Poll</a>, they are beginning to turn on President Obama, especially over the healthcare issue. &nbsp;No Democrat, no matter how entrenched or well-known, will be safe this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
