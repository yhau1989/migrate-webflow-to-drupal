Jan Brewer signed into law in April and is scheduled to take effect July 29, will generate enough angry new Latino voters...to reshape this state's hard-line approach to immigration,” the Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-arizona-voters-20100706,0,3328699.story?page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Will it work?&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Times</em> goes on to imply that the new immigration law might just compromise (and even snuff out) the Republican vote with Hispanics in Arizona’s future government. <br><br>To support its theory, the <em>Times</em> appeals to fairly recent history regarding California’s effort to make sure illegal aliens do not unlawfully receive benefits.&nbsp; The Republican-led Proposition 187, by way of remembrance, was a state measure that sought to bar illegal aliens from health care, public education, and other social services.&nbsp;</p><p>What followed in 1994 was not good for Republicans, with the rejected measure becoming a thorn in the side of Republicans reaching across the aisle to court Hispanics.&nbsp; “More than 1 million California Latinos became citizens after the passage of anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994, putting the state solidly in the hands of Democrats and pushing immigration crackdowns to the margins,” the <em>Times</em> noted.&nbsp;</p><p>So, could the same consequences happen to Arizona Republicans with the law that targets illegal immigrants in their state?&nbsp;</p><p>Based on what took place in California, there very well might be a slight tilt in the Arizona electorate.&nbsp; However, it is not likely there will be any major changes in Arizona's Republican leadership as a result of the new immigration law.&nbsp; After all, the political climates of Arizona and California are starkly different.&nbsp;</p><p>A majority of Arizona citizens support the law. The same result is not likely to be seen in California as the Golden State leans much more solidly liberal than its neighbor.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, the immigration reform debate is bigger than Arizona’s government.&nbsp; As is often repeated in modern political discourse, the issue really is a federal one.&nbsp; The only problem is that the federal government does not seem to be showing leadership on the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>President Obama’s <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/07/02/president-obamas-immigration-reform-speech-brings-more-partisanship" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigration speech</a> last week was reactionary in nature, being a response to those pressuring him to finally address the issue.&nbsp; If the speech had been a bit more anticipatory and pro-active, perhaps he’d be in a better position with Hispanics at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>While Republicans notoriously might have a hard time reaching Hispanics, the Democrats’ reach for the same voter demographic probably won’t be any easier.&nbsp; President Obama, more than any of his colleagues in Washington, knows this very well.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Washington Examiner</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/Losing-ground-with-Hispanics_-Obama-offers-immigration-plan-97622919.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">cites polls</a> showing that his support from the Hispanic community has dropped in consecutive months.</p>
