At the state and local levels, FAIR says that an average of less than 5 percent of of public costs associated with illegal immigration are recouped through taxes from illegals.&nbsp;</p><p>Most striking is FAIR’s finding that most illegals do not pay taxes. Among those who do, revenues collected are refunded back to illegals as they are at the bottom of the tax bracket.&nbsp;</p><p>FAIR is a non-profit organization and has three issues in mind: to improve border security, to stop illegal immigration, and to promote immigration levels consistent with what they deem the “national interest.” In FAIR’s research, they have found that the more traditional rates of about 300,000 a year are ideal, and they seek to implement these aforementioned objectives in a non-discriminatory manner.&nbsp; FAIR’s membership is composed of a bipartisan audience, with both liberals and conservatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the 300,000 immigrant limit, FAIR advocates a “temporary moratorium” on some immigration in order to achieve this target rate.&nbsp; Its website states:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “FAIR advocates a temporary moratorium on all immigration except spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens and a limited number of refugees. A moratorium would allow us to hold a national debate and devise a comprehensive immigration reform strategy"&nbsp;</p><p>The report also concluded that the amnesty plan, adopted in 1986 under President Reagan, was an “unfortunate decision” that would not curtail illegal immigration if utilized today.</p>
