Citywide Policy Planning maintains the city's General Plan which provides guidance to all city agencies and departments regarding urban design, land use, transportation, housing, open space and a variety of other issues."</p><p>One of the five senior staff members to lose their jobs over the course of the investigation, a veteran Zoning Administrator by the name of Larry Badiner- made over $150,000 a year.</p><p>The ongoing scandal made headlines again this week when <em>SF Weekly</em> published some of its findings after making a public records request for the material that resulted in the firings.</p><p>Among other offensive and graphic materials, San Francisco's government employees were apparently exchanging photographs of a nude man with a chain saw... and a hula hoop.</p><p>While some readers found the story amusing (one commentator wrote: "LOL, thats just too funny dude. Seriously."), this is no laughing matter.</p><p>Years of pornography use during working hours on the taxpayers' dime in the middle of an economic downturn is not only an egregious waste of scarce resources, it's a form of sexual harrassment that creates a hostile work environment.</p><p><em>Navarette Law Firm</em>, a company that specializes in sexual harrassment cases with offices in San Francisco and San Jose, says that it is considered workplace sexual harrassment if someone has porn visible on their screen, tells sexual jokes, or sends e-mails of a sexual nature.</p><p>With this and many other recent examples of malfeasance by California's bureaucrats, residents of the Golden State must grapple with questions about and solutions to a culture of corruption and privilege in its vast public sector.</p>
