We will regret it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Friedman has a point.&nbsp; People who understand the exigencies of “cap and trade” are few and far between.&nbsp; Those who get the threat of big government are common.&nbsp; Global warming and its solutions are hard sells.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no real sense of urgency about global warming.&nbsp; It took a fictional disaster of world-wide proportions to get the public’s attention in the movie, “Day After Tomorrow.”&nbsp; But no one realistically expects that kind of precipitous change in our climate.&nbsp; The slow pace of global warming leaves it open to questions – is it real?&nbsp; is it temporary?&nbsp; is it just part of the planet’s normal cycles?&nbsp;</p><p>The most memorable line about global warming belongs to Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) who called it “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.”&nbsp; That was in 2006 – before much of the climate science had matured.&nbsp; But the statement has seared its way into the American psyche.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the recent NOAA announcement that 2010 has thus far been the <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/07/21/noaa-2010-land-and-ocean-surface-temperatures-warmest-record" rel="noopener noreferrer">warmest year on record</a> has been countered with a range of statistical and political alternatives.&nbsp; Some anti-global warming sources undermine scientific announcements with conspiracy theories.&nbsp; The <em>New American</em> report continually references the debunked Climategate email scandal as proof that global warming is a conspiracy by the scientific community.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the very real collusion of the world’s greatest polluters – including the big energy companies – is largely ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t believe that the world is about to turn into a molten ball of lava, but I have little patience with those who feel the scientific community is trying to create some sort of new world order based on the excuse of fighting climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s difficult to get people excited about the slow-moving danger that warming presents.&nbsp; But if we wait until the problem has reached a point of real urgency, we may just be too late.&nbsp;</p><p>If I’m going to err, I want it to be on the side of my grandchildren.&nbsp; That means pulling together some sort of action to combat global warming, decrease our dependence on fossil fuels, and maintain our quality of life.</p>
