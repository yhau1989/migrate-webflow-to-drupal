Bush for attempting to tackle immigration reform.&nbsp; Additionally, he praised the Republicans who formerly backed some sort of reform last year.&nbsp; But now, the president is shaking his head at what he perceives as Republican back-peddling on the controversial issue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just a few years ago, when I was a senator, we forged a bipartisan coalition in favor of comprehensive reform. Under the leadership of Senator Kennedy, who had been a longtime champion of immigration reform, and Senator John McCain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan bill through the Senate. But that effort eventually came apart. And now, under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like he recently characterized Republicans as wanting to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65T3TZ20100630" rel="noopener noreferrer">take the economy backwards</a>, he essentially did the same with immigration.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he painted his own party as the party of progress and beyond gridlock.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m ready to move forward; the majority of Democrats are ready to move forward; and I believe the majority of Americans are ready to move forward. But the fact is, without bipartisan support, as we had just a few years ago, we cannot solve this problem. Reform that brings accountability to our immigration system cannot pass without Republican votes. That is the political and mathematical reality,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The President neglected to call hesitant members of his own party to jump on board the reform boat.&nbsp; After all, Democratic support for immigration reform is certainly not unanimous. There are <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/105337-gutierrez-insufficient-number-of-democrats-to-pass-immigration-reform" rel="noopener noreferrer">still some</a> who are hesitant in supporting a measure.&nbsp;</p><p><br>So, while Obama paints his Democratic Party as the only party wanting progress on the issue, the hard numbers show this not to be the case.&nbsp; It is also quite strange that Obama poked his Republican opponents with partisan rhetoric considering that he also seemed to look down on such a tactic in the very same speech.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling -– and to the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, President Obama still condemned the Republican-approved Arizona immigration law.&nbsp; While he acknowledged the Arizona approach as “understandable,” he still labeled it as “ill-conceived,” “divisive,” and “difficult.” The administration still plans to challenge the law.&nbsp;</p><p>And for a president who says that he wants to end political polarization, he must find a way to explain why he knows the immigration situation of Arizona better than a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/arizona/70_of_arizona_voters_favor_new_state_measure_cracking_down_on_illegal_immigration" rel="noopener noreferrer">majority of the citizens</a> who approve the new law.</p>
