Bush, Senate Minority Leader John Boehner, or Governor Schwarzenegger.&nbsp;</p><p>Fiorina is banking on her reputation as a powerful business executive to carry her into the Senate, but a business resume is no guarantee of success as a legislator.&nbsp; As Mickey Edwards, who writes for <em>The Atlantic</em> and is both a former legislator and university professor, recently <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/06/the-difference-between-business-and-government/58085/" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> regarding the campaigns of Fiorina and gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman:&nbsp; “I do have a problem … with the continued promotion of business success as a qualifier for public office,” he wrote in a June 13 blog.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Success in the market is not an automatic disqualifier for public service, but it is a far different undertaking with different purposes and different values ….&nbsp; In fact, business and government -- while there may be skills involved that are translatable and useful as one moves from one sphere to another -- are in some ways polar opposite undertakings.”&nbsp;</p><p>Voters sense the difference in a legislator who works in support of a broad-based public constituency, and an executive who works in support of corporate shareholders and a monolithic board of directors.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s still possible for Barbara “don’t call me ma’m” Boxer to lose in November.&nbsp; After all, what’s politics if not a horse race? &nbsp;</p><p>But the realities of California’s leanings say that she’s likely to win a fourth term.<br><br></p>
