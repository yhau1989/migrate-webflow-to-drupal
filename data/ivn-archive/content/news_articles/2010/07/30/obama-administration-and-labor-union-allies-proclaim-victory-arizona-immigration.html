"SB 1070 protects all of us, every Arizona citizen and everyone here in our state lawfully."&nbsp;</p><p>Arizona will seek an appeal on the ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court, based in San Francisco, is considered among the most liberal-leaning in the nation.&nbsp; One way or another, the case was going to be headed in that direction as both parties involved in the lawsuit would have appealed the case had their respective side lost.&nbsp; It could be a year or more before the case possibly reaches the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p><p>While comprehensive immigration reform might be necessary to some extent, the way the Obama administration is handling the matter doesn’t appear to be consistent with the general welfare clause in the U.S. Constitution, a clause often cited in its justification for national healthcare reform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It would appear that the current administration is playing the special interest political game, a business as usual approach that many hoped would change.</p>
