<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Fiorina Boxer_monster_397x224.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://Fiorina%20Boxer_monster_397x224.jpg" title="Despite Boxer's popular pro-choice stance, Fiorina still within striking distance" width="300"></a></p><p>Barbara Boxer has a powerful weapon in her Senate battle against Carly Fiorina – and she has already begun to use it.&nbsp; That weapon is the abortion issue.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the latest <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/21/2903896/field-poll-voters-views-on-abortion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field Poll</a>, some 70 percent of Californians support a woman’s right to choose.&nbsp; Fiorina had to take a more conservative “pro-life” position in order to win the Republican primary.&nbsp; Boxer will hold that record over Fiorina’s head for the length of this campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, “choice” is the subject of two headlined articles on Boxer’s website.&nbsp; She claims endorsements and financial support from <em>NARAL Pro Choice America</em>, <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, <em>Emily’s List</em> and the <em>National Organization for Women</em> – all organizations that support a woman’s right to choose.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Fiorina has a bevy of pro-life endorsements, including Rick Santorum’s <em>National Right to Life</em>, the <em>California Pro-Life Council</em> and the <em>Susan B. Anthony List</em>.&nbsp; Although Fiorina tries her best to <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15632242" rel="noopener noreferrer">side-step</a> the abortion issue in public settings, these endorsements make a clear statement, which has been reinforced by <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-08/sarah-palins-endorsement-boosts-carly-fiorina-in-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">another pro-life endorsement</a> -- that of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin.&nbsp;</p><p>Fiorina’s endorsements are the classic double-edged swords of California politics.&nbsp; They provided a powerful boost during the Republican primary, and may have brought about Fiorina’s nomination.&nbsp; But, Republicans represent only about 30 percent of California voters.&nbsp; And both the <em>Field Poll</em> and the <em>PPIC Poll</em> show her anti-abortion positions to be out of step with the bulk of California voters.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this clear distinction in their stated views, Boxer leads Fiorina by only five percentage points (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/poll-california-governors_n_663924.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">39% to 34%</a>), with 22% still undecided.&nbsp; It’s far from Election Day, and serious campaigning traditionally does not begin until Labor Day.&nbsp; But, there are some reasons why Boxer’s in-synch position on choice with California voters has not made her an automatic selection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Boxer fatigue</strong>:&nbsp; It’s been 18 years since a brash new face emerged from Marin County and took her seat in the U.S. Senate.&nbsp; Now she’s the “same-old” in a year of anti-incumbency.&nbsp; Her non-politician opponent represents the perfect mix for 2010 – anti-government, anti-Washington, and a fresh face.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wink and nod politics</strong>:&nbsp; Californians may well believe that the far right positions Fiorina has taken are understandable given the realities of the Republican primary.&nbsp; But they may not believe those are her deeply held views.&nbsp; She wouldn’t be the first politician to have stretched the truth in order to win an election.&nbsp; Besides, she looks more like Geraldine Ferraro than Sarah Palin, so she may be perceived as a liberal on women’s issues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The woman thing</strong>:&nbsp; California clearly likes to elect women to important offices.&nbsp; With all the Republican men out of the way in the Senate race, voters can get their femme-fix and still vote Republican.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The economy, stupid</strong>:&nbsp; Fiorina comes out of the business world.&nbsp; She automatically gets credited with the seriousness of purpose that voters may feel is needed to fix the economy and bring jobs back to California.&nbsp; Boxer, not so much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fired Up R’s</strong>:&nbsp; It’s traditional for the party that won a big one to take some hits in the next election cycle.&nbsp; That seems to be the general direction of the 2010 elections, with Democrats expected to lose some seats and possibly even lose control of the House of Representatives.&nbsp; This year, R stands for Revved up and D stands for Demoralized, so voter turnout could wind up as Carly’s secret weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, for Fiorina to take a Senate seat away from the Democrats, all of the chips will have to fall her way.&nbsp; And she’ll need to moderate her positions – especially on the issue of abortion – with California’s electorate.&nbsp;</p>
