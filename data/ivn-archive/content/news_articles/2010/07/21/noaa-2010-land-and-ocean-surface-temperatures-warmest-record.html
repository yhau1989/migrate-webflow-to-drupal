<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/earth_hot.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://earth_hot.jpg" title="NOAA:  2010 land and ocean surface temperatures warmest on record" width="300"></a></p><p>NOAA says 2010 is the hottest year on record.&nbsp; However, skeptics, some of whom are in the scientific community, argue that the second half of 2010 will be <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/2010/06/rss-amsu-may-2010-cooler-than-may-1998.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooler</a> and that the evidence for global warming is cloudy at best.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s a layman to think?&nbsp;</p><p>Recent news that would seem to further strengthen the case for global warming has instead touched off a new wave of controversy.&nbsp; NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the U.S. weather bureau) released its <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100715_globalstats.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest data</a> on July 15.&nbsp; And the Climategate scandal was pronounced a non-issue by five independent agencies including the UK House of Commons’ Science and Technology Select Committee.&nbsp; But as CNN’s media reporter Howard Kurtz <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/media-not-excited-anymore-about-debunked-climategate-scandal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a>, the resolution of this issue went largely unreported – especially by such global warming skeptics as Glenn Beck.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, with scientific-sounding websites arguing both sides of the issue, it still sounds like a toss-up.&nbsp; Typical media reports seem to balance their approach by giving both positions similar exposure and credibility, even though the scientific consensus clearly favors the global warming position.&nbsp; The lack of scientific credibility of the most vocal skeptics also seems to unnecessarily cloud the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Leading the charge against global warming is Marc Morano – a political operative who originated the phony Swift Boat scandal that damaged John Kerry’s presidential bid.&nbsp; Morano’s website, <a href="http://www.climatedepot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Depot</a> claims that global warming is strictly a political issue. He claims tens of thousands of scientists have signed his petition stating that global warming is false, but a <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Marc_Morano" rel="noopener noreferrer">careful study</a> of the makeup of the signatures and the nature of the petition shows that many signers are neither scientists nor climate experts.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the present evidence, I believe that global warming is a serious problem – even if less so for the current generation than for the next one.&nbsp; A united, worldwide effort to combat the anthropogenic aspects of global warming could avert disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But, a critically-thinking mind is needed to carefully sift through media reports and political posturing, as sloppy journalistic practices, sensationalism, and party politics all too often drown out peer-reviewed scientific data. &nbsp;</p>
