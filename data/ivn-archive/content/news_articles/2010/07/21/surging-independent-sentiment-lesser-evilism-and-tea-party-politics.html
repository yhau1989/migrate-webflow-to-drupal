As soon as they get here, we need to co-opt them." &nbsp;</p><p>Outspoken Republican Rep. Michelle Bachman has already begun such an effort in the House, having founded a “<a href="http://caivn.org/article/2010/07/20/tea-party-caucus-forms-congress-ahead-november-elections" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tea Party Caucus</a>” in the chamber just this week.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the tea party movement is so often treated as a monolith in the mainstream media, it is important here to distinguish between three different types of tea party groups: 1) some tea party organizations, and many of the most well-known, are nothing more than Republican Party front organizations 2) some are relatively non-partisan grassroots groups that are open to Independent and third party alternatives to the Democratic-Republican political cartel 3) others are fledgling third party political organizations dedicated to providing a viable alternative to the Democratic and Republican parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Among self-described tea party activists who have ironically proven incapable of declaring their political independence from&nbsp; the reigning two-party state, it is virtually an article of faith that any third party tea party organization is part of a vast Democratic conspiracy to “split the conservative vote.” &nbsp;In this way, they aim to shore up support for the Republican lesser evil. &nbsp;</p><p>In one of the more extreme examples of this genre of political attack, Republican Danny Tarkanian went so far as to allege an “Armenian” connection between Democrat Harry Reid’s campaign and that of third party Tea Party candidate Jon Scott Ashjian in the Nevada Senate race. &nbsp;More recently, Republicans have accused third party Tea Party groups in Florida, <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2010/07/petitions_filed_to_be_put_tea.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michigan</a> and <a href="http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20100719/NEWS01/7190324/Tea-partye%20r-steeped-in-mystery" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Jersey</a> of being puppets of the local Democratic Party machine.&nbsp;</p><p>Though paranoid, such suspicions are not unreasonable. &nbsp;<a href="http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/07/democratic-party-appeals-to-gr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican Party operatives</a>, for instance, reportedly organized and funded the Texas Green Party’s ballot access petition drive this year.&nbsp; This caused a minor scandal for the minor party when the Democrats sued in an attempt to keep them off the ballot and thus ensure that Democrats would face as little political competition as possible in this year’s elections.&nbsp; Fortunately for the Green Party and the people of Texas, the Democrats failed in their undemocratic effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Even a casual observer of Democratic-Republican party politics today would recognize that there is virtually no limit to the mendacity of Democrats and Republicans to retain and expand the scope of their political power, and that of the two-party state.&nbsp; Their words and actions demonstrate as much, but we don't have to settle.</p>
