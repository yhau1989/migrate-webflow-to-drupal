The reason, according to experts keeping close tabs on the races, is straightforward: Republicans have simply worked harder to court the Hispanic vote in the wake of the Arizona law.”&nbsp;</p><p>This has certainly played itself out in California where both Whitman and Fiorina have gone to extra lengths to reach for the Hispanic vote.&nbsp; Also worth keeping in mind is the fact that primary Republican voters in California defeated any notion that they are anti-immigrant in their snubbing of illegal immigrant crusader Steve Poizner.&nbsp; Voters, while believing that illegal immigration is a problem, rejected Poizner’s making the issue a centerpiece of his campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on current Republican rhetoric, it will be interesting to see which direction Hispanics swing.</p>
