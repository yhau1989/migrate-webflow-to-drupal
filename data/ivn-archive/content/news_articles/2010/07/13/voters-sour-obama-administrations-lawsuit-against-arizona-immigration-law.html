So my question is why did the president only ask DOJ to look at Arizona and not everywhere?,” she asked.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where the sanctuary cities, like ones in Los Angeles and Sacramento, come into play.&nbsp; Called into question is the administration’s consistency in dealing with immigration policy.&nbsp; Singling out Arizona and not calling out sanctuary cities like ones in California only makes the DOJ’s lawsuit look all the more politicized.</p>
