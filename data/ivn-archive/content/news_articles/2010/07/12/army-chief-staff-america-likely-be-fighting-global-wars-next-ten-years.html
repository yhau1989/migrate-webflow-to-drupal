Even General Casey, in his discussion, mentioned the necessity of better providing for the long-term health of soldiers.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, over 5,000 soldiers have already been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, with well over 30,000 maimed for life.&nbsp; These numbers continue to spike as the Afghanistan War escalates.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, without major cuts in other areas of the federal budget, protracted military conflicts and nation building efforts will prove fiscally unsustainable.&nbsp; Yet, neither party appears to possess the will to make these drastic cuts while prosecuting open-ended overseas wars.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, ten more years of Afghanistan and Iraq-like operations will also place further psychological and physical strain on a military that is already stretched to the limit.&nbsp; In order to avoid repeated deployments to multiple war theaters, civilian leadership would need to consider calling for a draft, employing more mercenaries (private contractors), shifting soldiers from our other 700+ bases around the world, or somehow boosting current recruitment levels.&nbsp;</p><p>As America is nearly nine years into the Afghanistan War, over seven years into the Iraq War, and continuing to suffer from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, it would do well to think long and hard about the potential economic, social, and strategic ramifications of another ten years of global war.</p>
