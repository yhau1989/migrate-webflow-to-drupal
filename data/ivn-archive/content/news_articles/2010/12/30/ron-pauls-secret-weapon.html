US Army Major Don Vandergriff praised his foreign policy and nominated him as '<a href="http://views.washingtonpost.com/leadership/panelists/2010/12/ron-paul.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leader of the Year in 2010</a>'.</p><p>5.&nbsp; He served as a flight surgeon for five years in the U.S. Air National Guard and U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War.</p><p>While most Republicans are now aware of his stalwart fiscal conservatism and prescient economic predictions, they are largely unaware of his war service and the credible support for his alternative views on national security.&nbsp; If he plans on challenging the likes of Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, and other high-profile Republicans for the GOP nomination, then his campaign will have to make touting his military credentials a much higher priority this time around.</p><p>Perhaps this strategy will serve as Dr. Paul's secret weapon.</p>
