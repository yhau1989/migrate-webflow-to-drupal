Bush and the Republican Party as vigorously as it criticized Democrats.</p><p>Three years later, its impact has created somewhat of a revolution in American politics.&nbsp; The current, post-Obama tea party movement owes its very existence to Dr. Ron Paul and his cadre of followers.&nbsp; And now, Ron Paul, once ignored and often maligned, is a fixture on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and a plethora of other media outlets seeking his independent-minded views on economics, the Federal Reserve, war, civil liberties, and politics.</p><p>Looking ahead to next year, Congressman Paul will be facing off against the world's most powerful man, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, as the Texas Congressman is set to chair the House's monetary policy subcommittee.&nbsp; Dr. Paul is also considering another presidential bid, putting the current odds of a second run at <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20025443-503544.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">50-50</a>.&nbsp; If he does decide to launch another campaign, the odds are that the $6 million one-day fundraising record will be quickly broken.</p>
