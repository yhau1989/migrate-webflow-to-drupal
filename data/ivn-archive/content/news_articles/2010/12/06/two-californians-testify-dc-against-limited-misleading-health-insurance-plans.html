<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/070703_insurance_hmed_7a.hmedium.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="cloudinary://070703_insurance_hmed_7a.hmedium.jpg" title="Two Californians testify in DC against limited, misleading health insurance plans" width="300"></a></p><p>At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last week, Senators examined health insurance plans that offer minimal coverage to millions of Americans known as "mini-med" as these plans will remain available for a number of years despite violating the new rules under health care reform legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally, mini-med plans were designed for low-wage Americans who could not&nbsp;afford comprehensive health insurance, yet would cover costs associated with a serious illness, or so was believed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many of these plans are designed to pay less than the amount&nbsp;they said will be covered.&nbsp; For example, a health insurance policy may promise coverage of $50,000 annually, but when you read the fine print, the plan may severely limit the amount of coverage.&nbsp; For two Californians who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/business/02insure.html?_r=3&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=health%20insurance&amp;st=cse" rel="noopener noreferrer">testified</a>, that was&nbsp;certainly the case.</p>
<p>Eugene Melville of Riverside bought a limited health insurance plan from Aetna believing that the policy was capped at $20,000 annually.&nbsp; When Mr. Melville was diagnosed with oral cancer, he was quickly informed that the plan only paid <a href="http://www.pe.com/localnews/politics/stories/PE_News_Local_D_health02.48a04d6.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000</a> in doctors' visits and care provided outside a hospital.&nbsp; Jessica Lynn Carroll&nbsp;of San Jose had a similar experience with her Aetna policy after going to the emergency room when she lost feeling in one of her arms.&nbsp; What Ms. Carroll found out was that the Aetna policy only paid $500 toward the bill and ended up with a $16,000 bill for her care.&nbsp; According to Jessica, "In no way did I expect the bill that arrived.&nbsp; If I had known the insurance I had in th first place was so absurd,&nbsp; I would have never purchased it.</p>
<p>Echoing that sentiment was Senator Rockefeller (D-WV) noting that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More than a million Americans enrolled in these plans think they have health insurance to protect them from financial catastrophe if they become seriously ill or hurt.&nbsp; In fact, they don't."</p>
<p>Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Ca)&nbsp;characterized the situation during the hearing saying that "mini-med plans often mislead consumers about the level of coverage offered."</p>
<p>Mini-med insurance plans made headlines when McDonalds threatened to pull health insurance coverage for its employees, telling the Obama Administration that the plans it&nbsp;offers employees&nbsp;would be unable to meet the minimum requirement that 80% of a health insurance company's expenses&nbsp;be directed toward&nbsp;patient care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the health insurance plans are also in violation of the health care reform law because it places a&nbsp;lifetime cap on coverage.&nbsp; Today at McDonalds, employees pay $11 per week, or nearly $600 annually, for coverage that maxes out at $2,000.&nbsp; McDonalds has requested a waiver from the new rules&nbsp; - which it has been granted for one year - so it could continue to offer its current plans to its employees&nbsp;while the Obama Administration determines what to do with the mini-med plans.</p>
<p>In the meantime, millions of Americans will continue to be&nbsp;offered and covered by&nbsp;min-med health insurance plans for another three years until&nbsp;the exchanges are up and running in 2014.&nbsp;For those&nbsp;like Mr. Melville and Ms. Carroll with their thousands of dollars of medical bills, where is their waiver?&nbsp;</p>
