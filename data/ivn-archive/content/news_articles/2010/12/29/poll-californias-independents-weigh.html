Similarly, large majorities of Independents, Democrats and Republicans  disapprove of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s handling of the state's governorship. &nbsp;The  state legislature fared even worse. &nbsp;Only 18% of Democrats, 6% of  Republicans and 9% of Independents approve of the way that the California  legislature is handling its job.&nbsp;</p><p>These  approval numbers correlate closely with attitudes toward the state  government in general. &nbsp;66% of Independents, 70% of Democrats and 69% of  Republicans said that the state government in Sacramento can be trusted  “to do what is right” only some of the time. &nbsp;In the same vein, a  majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents agree that “people  in state government waste a lot of the money we pay in taxes.” &nbsp;On this  score, it is noteworthy that Californians are losing trust in one  another, let alone elected officials. &nbsp;Though a slim majority of  Democrats state that they have at least a fair amount of trust and  confidence in California’s voters “when it comes to making public policy  at the ballot box,” a majority of Republicans and Independents have  little or no such trust and confidence in their fellow citizens.  &nbsp;According to the PPIC, this marks the first time in a statewide survey  that less than half of all respondents had at least a fair amount of  confidence in the state’s electorate.&nbsp;</p><p>The  opinions of Independents appear to diverge most strikingly from those  of Democrats and Republicans on issues that polarize supporters of the  major parties. &nbsp;For instance, while 82% of Democrats approve of Barack  Obama’s handling of the presidency and 83% of Republicans disapprove of  the same, Independents are more conflicted than their partisan  counterparts. &nbsp;54% approve of the job the president is doing, while 42%  disapprove. &nbsp;On the other hand, majorities of Democrats (60%) and  Republicans (87%) disapprove of the way the US Congress is handling its  job, as do a majority of Independents (78%). &nbsp;Similarly, while 79% of  Democrats said they would prefer to have the Congress controlled by  Democrats, and 82% of Republicans stated they would rather have the  Congress controlled by Republicans, 25% of Independents  volunteered that neither of the major parties should have control of the  federal legislature. &nbsp;Of course, there is only one way to ensure that  neither the Democratic nor Republican party controls the Congress: elect  Independent and minor party candidates to public office.&nbsp;</p><p>See the <a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=964" rel="noopener noreferrer">full report</a> at the website of the Public Policy Institute of California.</p>
