headline: Cold Shoulder in Saudi Arabia? Why We Should Care

<p>While many news outlets received <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/20/obama-grateful-saudi-kings-hospitality/" rel="noopener noreferrer">good political mileage</a>&nbsp;Wednesday, flaunting the fact that President Obama was met at the airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia by a low-level official (the mayor) followed by cool, if not outright cold, negotiations -- there are underlying reasons that we should be really caring about.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Really in the 28-pages of the 9/11 Report?</strong></h3>
<p>This has always been something that has been a potential political firestorm, as&nbsp;15 of the 19 hijackers during 9/11 were Saudi citizens.</p>

<p>While the pressure and emphasis has always been put on bin Laden's terrorist planning and organization, we've really never addressed the fact that Al-Qaeda was a popular movement within Saudi Arabia, with citizens traveling to strongholds for training and deployment.</p>

<p>The American people&nbsp;have never known exactly what our government truly knew about the Saudi government's involvement, or even if they had advanced intelligence.</p>

<p>The potential release of this information could severely change public opinion on a long-term, quasi-friendly ally that is geographically important to us because of their proximity to current enemies.</p>
<h3><strong>Congressional Bill Allowing 9/11 Victims' Families to Sue Saudi Kingdom</strong></h3>
<p>A 1976 federal law makes it fairly difficult for an American citizen to sue a foreign nation in American courts.</p>

<p>This could change if more support is gathered on a bill that would directly allow families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi Kingdom, members of the Royal Family, their banks, and charities.</p>

<p>President Obama is against such measures, while Trump, Cruz, Sanders, and Clinton all support it.</p>

<p>Of course, Saudi Arabian officials have threatened to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-threatens-to-sell-off-us-assets-if-congress-passes-911-bill-a6987281.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull their assets</a> from the U.S., but many of their assets are in the form of property that would not be easily liquidated before it could be frozen by courts.</p>

<p>This is more than a slight irritation for the Saudis, as oil transactions worldwide are almost universally conducted in U.S. dollars. This places the House of Saud in a position where they can never really fully protect their assets from U.S. courts.</p>
<h3><strong>A 'New' Form of Saudi Jihadist Movement Arising</strong></h3>
<p>In America, we too often focus on ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and Boko Haram (to a lesser extent) without really examining their roots, or even looking to newer threats.</p>

<p>Wahhabism, an ultra-conservative sect of Islam, has been on the rise since the 1970s and directly inspired&nbsp;bin Laden's Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union in the 1980's -- the very beginning of what would become Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>While having some setbacks in popularity in the late 1990s through the 9/11 aftermath -- largely from government crackdowns -- the movement is now fully back in place, a populist movement within the country that the government can't control.</p>

<p>The more we crack down on terrorism, the more likely we will have to deal with this movement. And this can't make the House of Saud rest easily.</p>
<h3><strong>Let's not Forget About Oil</strong></h3>
<p>At this point, no oil producing country is happy with the fact that oil prices have been suppressed since late 2014.</p>

<p>American domestic companies are pumping to pay debt service; Russian and Iranian companies need dollars at any cost. They'd rather trade their own currency at a loss to gain dollars to stabilize their businesses and economy.</p>

<p>What started as a Saudi ploy to kill off newer production methods has now fully backfired on them. The longer this continues the bigger the losses they are accruing.</p>

<p>And while we really don't care how much money they lose, it does put strains on diplomatic relations in a region where we need every 'ally' we can get.</p>
<h3><strong>But Do We Really Still Need Them as an Ally?</strong></h3>
<p>That's the big question.</p>

<p>Most of the time, they realize that they tend to need us a whole lot more than we need them. But they have been on a mass weapons buying spree, becoming the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/238881-saudi-arabia-arms-import/" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest importer</a> of arms in the world in 2015.</p>

<p>While we've been busy with&nbsp;Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran, they've led their <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/saudi-military/" rel="noopener noreferrer">own intervention</a> in the Yemeni Civil War.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it's widely believed that Saudi Arabia funded Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, with the understanding that they would eventually take delivery on their own <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/05/19/iran-country-middle-east-not-allowed-nuclear-weapons/" rel="noopener noreferrer">off-the-shelf nukes</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, they are quickly becoming a significant threat politically, economically, <span>and</span> militarily -- and they don't seem too interested in backing down.</p>

<p>While it may be expedient to poke fun at the president for a foreign policy failure by being snubbed, we really need to rethink our relationship with Saudi Arabia and not be short-sighted in only seeing the domestic political mileage.</p>

<p>Because like it or not, they are becoming one of our greatest threats.</p>
