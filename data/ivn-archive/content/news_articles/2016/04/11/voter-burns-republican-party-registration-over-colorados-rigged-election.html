<p>A Trump supporter from Colorado is not happy with the Republican Party. And for good reason. Instead of conducting a primary election or a caucus, which would give regular voters the opportunity to vote for the next president of the United States, the Republican Party of Colorado chose to hold only a state convention. At a state convention, only party insiders are invited to attend and the rules are governed exclusively by the party leadership.</p>

<p>At the convention, party insiders gave all of the state's 34 delegates to Ted Cruz, without a vote.</p>

<p>It should be little surprise that this Colorado voter is fed up with the Republican Party. Their opinion literally does not matter. Because Colorado did not hold a primary or caucus, the average&nbsp;voter is completely removed from the process.</p>

<p>In statewide elections, Colorado has a closed primary system. By&nbsp;burning his party registration, he joins the 37% of the state that have taken the effort to register to vote, but would rather not have the right to vote in primaries than affiliate with either of the major parties.</p>
