[gravityform id="64" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]New legislation&nbsp;introduced in the New York Assembly would change the way the state conducts its presidential primary elections.&nbsp;The bill would allow "undeclared voters" (independents) to participate in the party primary of their choice, creating a system that resembles a semi-closed primary, except the parties cannot bar these voters from participating.

<p><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/a9661/amendment/original" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly Bill A9661</a> was introduced by New York Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele on March 24, 2016. Instead of outright replacing the current closed primary system, which only allows voters registered with a qualified political party to participate, the bill would open the door for independent voters to participate in a single party's primary, while keeping everyone else confined to the party on their registration card.</p>

<p><a href="http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2015/A9661" rel="noopener noreferrer">S 2-123</a> of the bill states:</p>

<p><em>OPEN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF&nbsp;LAW TO THE CONTRARY, AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, AN UNDECLARED&nbsp;VOTER SHALL BE PERMITTED TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY OF&nbsp;ANY PARTY. SUCH UNDECLARED VOTER MAY ONLY VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL&nbsp;PRIMARY OF ONE PARTY. SUCH UNDECLARED VOTER SHALL SELECT THE PARTY IN&nbsp;WHICH THE VOTER WISHES TO CAST SUCH A BALLOT ON THE DAY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY&nbsp;AT THE POLLING PLACE OF THE UNDECLARED VOTER AT THE TIME&nbsp;SUCH VOTER SEEKS TO CAST A BALLOT.</em></p>

<p>The amended law&nbsp;would only affect presidential primary elections.</p>

<p>What Thiele is proposing is not quite the same as the semi-closed system in states like California, where the parties can choose whether or not to allow independent voters to participate in their taxpayer-funded presidential primaries, but it is not like the open partisan system&nbsp;in states like Texas, where all registered voters can choose a single party's ballot and must stick with that party's ballot throughout the primary process.</p>

<p>The bill would also not affect current <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/12/thought-arizona-bad-new-york-primaries-worse/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter registration deadlines</a>, which require registered voters to change their party affiliation 6&nbsp;months before the presidential primary if they wish to vote for a candidate in another party. This also applies to people who would re-register as an independent voter in order to broaden their choices on primary election day. New voters or previously unregistered voters can register up to about a month before the primary.</p>

<p>Since the bill is currently sitting in committee, the earliest it would take effect is the 2020 presidential election.</p>
