[gravityform id="76" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]Twenty-nine seconds: according to Lee Fang and Zaid Jilani of&nbsp;<p><em><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/04/12/democracy-spring-media-coverage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Intercept</a></em>, this is how much time&nbsp;cable news networks&nbsp;Fox News and MSNBC devoted to daytime and afternoon TV coverage of the Democracy Spring protests as of April 12.&nbsp;On April 11, when 400&nbsp;protestors were arrested for a sit-in at the Capitol, some were heard&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/719607078445301760" rel="noopener noreferrer">chanting</a>, "Where is CNN?" which had not yet covered&nbsp;the protests.</p>

<p>The nonpartisan protest movement, which began on April 2 with a 140-mile march from Philadelphia to Washington D.C., <a href="http://www.democracyspring.org/the_campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer">aims</a> to raise public awareness about the influence of money in politics&nbsp;and to pressure lawmakers&nbsp;to find&nbsp;"solutions to our deeply corrupt political system." Between April 16 and April 18, a coalition of more than <a href="http://democracyawakening.org/who-we-are/" rel="noopener noreferrer">200 organizations</a>&nbsp;calling itself Democracy Awakening joined the protests, holding a series of <a href="http://democracyawakening.org/events/" rel="noopener noreferrer">events</a>&nbsp;from teach-ins to a rally to visits with members of Congress.</p>

<p>Despite more than 1,200 protestors being <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/18/over-1200-protesters-arrested-democracy-spring/" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested</a> for acts of civil disobedience – including the founders of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, actress Rosario Dawson, liberal commentator Cenk Uygur, and Miss New Jersey Sameera Khan, the mainstream media's coverage of the protests has been <a href="https://thirdrailnews.org/2016/04/19/media-democracy-spring/" rel="noopener noreferrer">limited</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/04/19/ice-cream-barons-ben-cohen-and-jerry-greenfield-arrested-in-democracy-now-protest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">dismissive</a>.</p>

<p>Also among those arrested was Harvard law professor and brief presidential candidate <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2016/04/19/harvard-professor-former-presidential-candidate-arrested-dc-protest" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence Lessig</a>, who marched with the Democracy Spring protestors from Philadelphia.&nbsp;Lessig in many ways has provided the intellectual basis for the movement's explicit focus on "corruption" (rather than "voting rights," as some TV journalists <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/04/12/democracy-spring-media-coverage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">have claimed</a>).</p>

<p>Citing several key provisions of the Constitution and Madison's statement in&nbsp;<em>The Federalist No. 52</em> that the legislative branch should be "dependent on the people alone," Lessig <a href="http://harvardlawreview.org/2012/12/a-reply-to-professor-hasen/" rel="noopener noreferrer">argues</a> that the current campaign finance system has created a climate in&nbsp;which lawmakers are reliant not on the the people who elect them, but on wealthy donors and political&nbsp;groups that&nbsp;sustain&nbsp;their campaigns through massive donations and expenditures.</p>

<p>Lessig&nbsp;claims that the current state of affairs amounts to a specific kind of corruption – one that differs from corruption involving quid pro quo bribery, which he calls "dependence corruption."</p>

<p>The increased political spending and power&nbsp;of wealthy groups and campaign-independent groups since the&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em> decision in 2010 show that candidates&nbsp;are, to a significant degree, dependent on the largesse of fundraisers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/14/the-most-depressing-graphic-for-members-of-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">One leaked slide</a> from a presentation delivered to freshman Democrats by the&nbsp;Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee after the 2012 elections clearly&nbsp;laid bare this dependence.&nbsp;It recommended that the freshmen devote&nbsp;approximately 4 hours of each workday to "call time," a euphemism for <a rel="noopener noreferrer">contacting donors and asking for campaign contributions</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to relying on direct contributors, campaigns are often supported and driven by outside groups as well, such as tax-exempt 501(c)(4) "social welfare" groups (which do not need to disclose their donors) and non-coordinated super PACs (which must disclose their donors). Both of these kinds of organizations can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.</p>

<p>Some&nbsp;of these groups are funded in large part&nbsp;by a small&nbsp;group of elite&nbsp;donors, many of them out-of-state – a sign that lawmakers are not "dependent on the people alone." A study of the 2014 midterm election found that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/28/top-super-pac-donors-of-the-midterms-steyer-bloomber-singer-mercer/18060219/" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-third</a> of the $600 million raised&nbsp;by super PACs came from just 42 individuals. In the ongoing 2016 election cycle, the figures are similar: of the $600 million given to super PACs thus far, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-new-gilded-age-close-to-half-of-all-super-pac-money-comes-from-50-donors/2016/04/15/63dc363c-01b4-11e6-9d36-33d198ea26c5_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">40 percent</a> has come from just 50 mega-donors.</p>

<p>As evidence of lawmakers'&nbsp;dependence on big money, some have credited these outside groups with launching their campaigns and even helping them win.</p>

 of well-funded groups and individuals that "really started [her]&nbsp;trajectory."<p>At a secret conference held by Charles and David Koch in the summer of 2014, for instance, then-candidate and future Iowa senator Joni Ernst&nbsp;said&nbsp;that it was&nbsp;her exposure to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/the-kochs-vs-the-gop-215672" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Koch's&nbsp;network</a></p>

<p>And in February 2015, after the midterms, freshman U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska thanked the Chamber of Commerce for backing his successful campaign, <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/03/30/17000/us-chamber-doubling-down-political-juggernaut" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, "Without your support, I think it’s very doubtful I’d be sitting here as your U.S. senator, talking to you right now.”</p>

<p>Yet candidates with wealthy supporters are not the only ones who benefit from the current campaign finance system.</p>

<p>Much of the money raised&nbsp;by outside groups is spent on TV&nbsp;advertisements&nbsp;– advertisements that are highly profitable for the major networks. Estimates for the amount of money&nbsp;to be spent on TV ads for the 2016 election season range from <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/19/432759311/2016-campaign-tv-ad-spending" rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.4 billion</a> to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/05/22/one-group-americans-drool-wall-wall-presidential-campaign-ads-next-year-media-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than $5 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Les Moonves, the president of CBS, has been particularly blunt about the profitability of the current campaign finance rules and political climate since&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em>. In 2012, celebrating an expected&nbsp;$180 million increase in profits for his network as a result of ad spending, Moonves <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-10/political-tv-ads-on-cbs-will-increase-profit-by-180-million-moonves-says" rel="noopener noreferrer">proclaimed</a>, "Super PACs may be bad for America, but they’re very good for CBS.”</p>

<p>It is for this simple financial reason that the major TV networks have likely provided such limited coverage of the anti-corruption, pro-reform protests in Washington: changes to the current campaign finance system could cost the major networks untold millions in revenue.</p>

<p>And it is not only through a media brownout of the protests&nbsp;that the major TV networks are resisting reform, but through the political process as well.</p>

<p>Through their lobbyists, especially those in the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and&nbsp;National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association&nbsp;(NCTA), the networks have fought – and continue to fight –&nbsp;laws and regulations that would diminish their lucrative&nbsp;control over the flow of campaign information. Measures these groups have lobbied against on the networks' behalf include the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/behind-closed-doors-broadcasters-battle-online-disclosure-of-political-ad-b" rel="noopener noreferrer">mandatory&nbsp;online disclosure</a>&nbsp;of political ad information, the erection and maintenance of barriers designed to prevent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/05/06/just-what-doctor-didnt-order-more-media-consolidation" rel="noopener noreferrer">media consolidation</a>, and&nbsp;the provision of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/free-tv-speech-candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer">free</a> and <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0510/NAB_president_has_bone_to_pick_with_Dems.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">more affordable</a> airtime for campaigns.</p>

<p>Since the protestors are <a href="http://democracyawakening.org/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanding</a>, among other reforms, a constitutional amendment overturning <em>Citizens United</em> and the passage of legislation that would empower small donors, it is little surprise that the mainstream media is protecting its interests by giving&nbsp;the movement short shrift. But the&nbsp;media&nbsp;may be protecting particular candidates as well.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Estimates for the amount of money to be spent on TV ads for the 2016 election season range from $4.4 billion to more than $5 billion." author=""]

<p>Hillary Clinton, for example, who has expressed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/g00//news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/14/hillary-clintons-litmus-test-for-supreme-court-nominees-a-pledge-to-overturn-citizens-united/" rel="noopener noreferrer">belated</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/04/14/to-protect-clinton-democrats-wage-war-on-their-own-core-citizens-united-argument/" rel="noopener noreferrer">inconsistent</a> opposition to the 2010 Supreme Court ruling, is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/10/29/media-fundraisers-presidential/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> by representatives of the major networks, including the <a href="http://iotwreport.com/comcast-exec-meets-with-holds-fundraiser-for-hillary-clinton-in-own-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vice president of Comcast</a> (which operates NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC) and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?id=Y0000046504L" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Elmendorf</a>, a powerful&nbsp;lobbyist&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/16/lobbyists-bundle-2-million-for-hillary-clinton/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton "bundler."</a></p>

<p>Given&nbsp;the public's general distrust of Clinton, <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/07/19521/how-citizens-united-helping-hillary-clinton-win-white-house" rel="noopener noreferrer">in part</a> because of her&nbsp;support from corporations, super PACs, and dark money groups, the media may be downplaying the protests to prevent Clinton from having to address the influence&nbsp;of money in politics.</p>

<p>Trump, who has also been <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-all-over-the-place-take-big-money-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer">inconsistently</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-04/trump-the-developer-loves-low-interest-rates-trump-the-candidate-sees-a-bubble-" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical</a> of the&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em> ruling and the current campaign finance system, has avoided having to talk in-depth about <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/01/28/trump-says-no-one-knows-how-money-has-corrupted-washington-better-than-him/" rel="noopener noreferrer">his history</a>&nbsp;as a donor and lobbyist and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/17/politics/donald-trump-public-financing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">specify</a> what reform measures he would support as president.</p>

<p>Regular media coverage of the protests&nbsp;could thus not only energize a reform movement hostile to its interests, but it could also generate tension between the networks and candidates with whom they have a positive, <a href="http://ivn.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=23295677645&amp;action=edit" rel="noopener noreferrer">"mutually dependent" relationship</a>.</p>

<p>Dismayed by a lack of media attention, protestors are now leaving the capital&nbsp;and taking their messages <a href="http://billmoyers.com/story/for-democracy-marchers-the-next-battle-is-on-the-home-front/" rel="noopener noreferrer">back home</a>.&nbsp;But before departing, some activists met with lawmakers and their directors and had the chance to explain to them the urgency of reform and its&nbsp;potential benefits. As one Massachusetts resident put it, speaking optimistically about how reform might change Washington,&nbsp;“I think if we could get money out of politics, a lot of other things would fall into place.”</p>
