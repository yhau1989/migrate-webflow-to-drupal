<p>Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is often plain spoken, even about his own party's flaws.</p>

<p>In a meeting with the Washington Post's editorial board, Kasich gave a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/20/a-transcript-of-john-kasichs-interview-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/" rel="noopener noreferrer">brutally honest reason</a> for his party's opposition to D.C. statehood:</p>
<blockquote>What it really gets down to, if you want to be honest, is because they know thatâ€™s just more votes in the Democratic Party.</blockquote>
<p>Looking at any red/blue county map, you can instantly see what Kasich is talking about. Most of the urban areas in and around Washington D.C. tend to vote solidly Democratic in most elections.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. -- just the federal zone (not the surrounding metropolitan area) -- would become the 49th most populated state -- ahead of Vermont and Wyoming, but still well within the range of only getting allocated 1 House member and the standard 2 senators.</p>

<p>The 'all-powerful' ability to form or deny cloture in the Senate, would give the Democratic Party an instant overnight advantage.</p>

<p>This kind of political jockeying is far from abnormal in our country's history.</p>

<p>Even the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was designed to maintain the status quo -- Missouri admitted as a slave state, Maine admitted as a free state. This balance would remain until the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 upset the balance, and was seen as one of the primary political causes of the Civil War.</p>

<p>In recent history, however, admitting states has been more along economic instead of political lines; D.C. would definitely not be an economic burden to the U.S., having one of the strongest economies of cities in the country.</p>

<p>So, more than likely Kasich is probably right when he suggests that denial of D.C. statehood is purely political in nature.</p>

<p>But the reality then becomes, why are we allowing political games to be played with the lives of over 670,000 American citizens? Especially when they pay in over <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/12db05co.xls" rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 billion</a> in federal taxes, the highest per capita federal tax in the nation, and still don't have representation in Congress.</p>
