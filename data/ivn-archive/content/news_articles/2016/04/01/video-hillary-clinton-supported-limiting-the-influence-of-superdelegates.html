<p>The Daily Caller recently reported on a video that shows current Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton coming out against the superdelegate system in 2008 when she was in a tight race with Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Now, Clinton reportedly has an "insurmountable" lead because of the number of superdelegates who have committed their support to her, many of whom made the decision before the first votes of the 2016 race were cast in Iowa.</p>

<p>The Daily Caller reports:</p>

<p><em>Asked during a May 18 interview with Kentucky’s WPSD-TV if there was “something wrong” with the superedelegate process, Clinton said that there was.</em></p>

<p><em>“I think we need to figure out how we can have a process that reflects the desire of the voters,” Clinton said in the interview, video of which was obtained by&nbsp;the Sidewire app’s Jonathan Allen.</em></p>

<p><em>“I think there’s a couple of problems with it,” Clinton added. “You know, if the Democrats had the same process as the Republicans have, I would be the Democratic nominee today because I’ve won more states with more electoral votes.”</em></p>

<p>To be clear, Hillary Clinton said the Republican Party had a more democratic process in selecting its presidential nominee than the <em>Democratic</em> Party.</p>

<p>However, the very system Clinton decried eight years ago is the same system she is benefiting from today. Clinton has a 55-45 percent advantage with pledged delegates, but she has a 94-6 lead with superdelegates, skewing media coverage to suggest that it is impossible for Bernie Sanders to catch up to her at this point.</p>

<p>What's more is that many of these superdelegates have promised to maintain their support for Clinton no matter what the results are in their state's primary or caucus, including a half dozen of the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-superdelegates-largely-back-clinton-sanders-article-1.2581729" rel="noopener noreferrer">superdelegates from New York</a>. Former DNC Chair <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/03/08/former-dnc-chair-superdelegates-dont-represent-the-people-theyll-do-what-they-want/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Dean</a> put it plainly when he said that he is not elected, therefore he doesn't have to represent voters.</p>

<p>Clinton may have come out against superdelegates in 2008, but she never pushed for a rule change. Instead, she learned how to navigate the delegate system and worked early to secure as many superdelegates as she could, giving her a huge advantage going into the presidential election. Now, it is paying off for her.</p>
