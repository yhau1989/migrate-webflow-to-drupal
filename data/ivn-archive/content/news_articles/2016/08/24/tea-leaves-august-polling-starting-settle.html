<p>There's an axiom in polling that goes back to 1936. If you expect to win the presidency, you'd better be polling well as September begins.</p>

<p>Nobody really 'likes' to admit that polling is as good of a science as it is; it tends to undermine our sense of control and autonomy -- that less than 1,000 people polled can represent the population of 146 million or so voters in the United States.</p>

<p>But that's the nature of statistics -- as well as the numbers being criticized for any number of reasons.</p>

<p>But the tea leaves of political fortune telling are starting to settle, with bad news for third-party candidates, in particular.</p>

<p>In possibly one of the most inclusive polls to date, <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/18/1-voters-general-election-preferences/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a> offers a lot of insight into the demographics of the third-party candidates -- &nbsp;most damaging in that they just can't seem to get traction outside of the under-30 voters, possibly the 'least critical' of all the demographics in American politics.</p>

<p>Love it or hate it, the Clinton campaign has done a good job neutralizing the effects of 'The Bern' on swaying support to the Johnson or Stein campaigns.</p>

<p>With Johnson drawing from the Republican base at a two-fold rate, compared to the Democratic base (22% to 11%, respectively), Johnson's gamble of attracting Sanders voters with the libertarian social ideology has seemed to fail.</p>

<hr>

<p>But August is also the time when the news outlets start making their solid, but still conservative projections on the electoral map.</p>

<p>In 2012, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/pollingcenter/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>&nbsp;projected Obama as clearly ahead (but not outright winning) in August, but he then won the toss-ups with a clean sweep to overwhelmingly win the Electoral College.</p>

<p>Even the more conservative <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/09/fox-news-poll-obama-lead-grows-as-romney-support-slips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> begrudgingly agreed, though still hopeful of a strong Romney surge.</p>

<p>The point being that it's not just the liberal media trying to sway voters with 'cooked up' polling numbers -- this has been a pretty accurate science.</p>

<p>But this August, it seems that <a href="http://www.270towin.com/maps/clinton-trump-electoral-map" rel="noopener noreferrer">all of the networks</a>&nbsp;and polling companies are agreeing that Clinton has an overwhelming lead in the Electoral College, and a strong 10+ point lead in the national polling.</p>

<p>The interesting part, however, is that this new data completely takes the so-called 'Holy Trinity' of battleground states (Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania) out of the equation -- with Clinton easily winning only capturing Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>But this new data is going to redouble the Republican efforts to proclaim Johnson the 'spoiler,' with traditionally deep-red Georgia being counted as a true toss-up due to the plurality in polling.</p>

<p>Clinton, trying to exploit the plurality weakness, has opened an office in Utah, where no Democrat has won in the past 50 years -- crazy things happen in a plurality.</p>

<p>The next 11 weeks will not be kind to the third-party candidates, with candidates employing all of the traditional tactics to neutralize them.</p>

<hr>

<p>So are the fortune-telling political tea leaves set for good -- or is there something that can be done about it?</p>

<p>We're sadly a nation that has turned non-voting into a national institution, with almost half of the eligible population choosing not to vote on election day.</p>

<p>Pollsters know this, and structure their polls around 'likely-voters' instead of just eligible ones.</p>

<p>Independents are too often stuck in the mode of trying to draw away the votes from the major parties, when we already have a large pool of untapped potential to work with.</p>

<p>If independents ever want to have a real say in the election process, we need to do a much better job of 'getting out the vote' for our cause among non-voters than the major parties have ever done.</p>

<p>Because that's part of the winning combination for independents -- fielding candidates at all levels of government, ideas for positive change, and enfranchising voters who have long given up on the process.</p>

<p>When all three of those have been done, the current polling models will be completely shattered -- and political fortune telling will just have to wait for election night.</p>
