<p>There seems to be an axiom in modern politics, that to win a general election you have to win over the moderates, but to win in the primary you have to '<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/10/26/best-party-member-sabotages-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer">be the best party member</a>' to have a chance.</p>

<p>Historically this has been very true in Kansas politics, a conservative stronghold in both national and state politics.</p>

<p>But Kansas seems to be at least partially bucking this trend. With <a href="http://www.kssos.org/elections/16elec/2016%20Election%20Information.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">165 legislative seats</a> up for grabs, moderates have unseated about 10 percent of the most conservative incumbents, including the Senate majority leader, <a href="http://cjonline.com/news/2016-08-02/least-11-conservatives-kansas-legislature-lose-seats-including-senate-majority" rel="noopener noreferrer">with more races still to be called</a>.</p>

<p>U.S. Rep.&nbsp;Tim Huelskamp, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/roger-marshall-wins-kansas-republican-primary-against-tea-party-incumbent" rel="noopener noreferrer">a tea party adherent</a>, also lost his primary battle to Roger Marshall. Marshall will face independent Alan LaPolice in the general election.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with the governor's great <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/02/25/5-things-that-have-people-asking-what-the-heck-is-going-on-in-kansas/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laffer Curve experiment</a> has largely fueled this resentment in once deep-red Kansas.</p>

<p>Personal and business taxes were slashed to stimulate the economy, starting in 2012, but no positive results have been seen -- with the state missing budget projects by millions each month.</p>

<p>This, coupled with the all-out war on the judicial branch over school funding and <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/01/21/kansas-judge-strikes-down-sec-of-state-kobachs-attempt-to-divide-voters-into-two-classes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter suppression issues</a>, has created inroads for moderate Republicans wanting to return to a more reasonable course.</p>

<p>While Kansas is a relatively small state, the impact of this could be profound -- that once safe seats nationwide have&nbsp;become&nbsp;targets for candidates willing to accept moderate positions and are able to reach across the aisle to work with political opponents for better policy.</p>

<p>It's encouraging to see a primary result like this; too often the Democratic and Republican primaries are rubber-stamps to the party's platform, with partisanship, inflexibility, and heated rhetoric the result.</p>

<p>Once again, we are seeing more and more evidence that 2016 could have been a year for independents nationwide, people willing to challenge the status quo of party politics.</p>

<p>Two Kansas independents, Alan LaPolice and Miranda Allen are fighting for U.S. House seats, after both completing the overwhelming task of collecting signatures to be placed on the November ballot.</p>

<p>But Tuesday's Kansas primary has shown one thing -- voters are stepping outside of the political party's 'power-base' and empowering themselves.</p>

<p>Because whether we are Democrat, Republican, independent, or other, we should all see ourselves as voters, as the ones with power, not any other person or organization.</p>
