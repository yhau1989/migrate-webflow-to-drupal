<p>After the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a> campaign put single-payer healthcare in the national spotlight, it's no surprise that many of his supporters are continuing to carry the torch. An initiative proposing a single-payer healthcare plan, popularly known as ColoradoCare, was placed on the November ballot by a petition signed by over 150,000 people. If voted in, ColoradoCare would create a statewide health system supported by an increase in taxes as well as employer and employee contributions.</p>

<p>Pro-reform advocates, most prominently ColoradoCare. Yes, claim ColoradoCare would close significant gaps left open by the Affordable Care Act. Opponents, such as Coloradans for Coloradans, cite the estimated $25 billion price tag and fears that medical professionals would be deterred from practicing in the state. The debate over ColoradoCare has attracted Democrats to both sides, highlighting a deep divide between progressives and liberals.</p>

<p>But who exactly is backing each side of the proposition?</p>

<p>ColoradoCareYes is backed mostly by individuals, who are responsible for 92.6% of all the money raised this cycle. Coloradans for Coloradans, on the other hand, has raised 98% of its funds from organizations.</p>

<p>Here is the list of the top organizations fighting to oppose ColoradoCare. The list includes medical and pharmaceutical groups such as Pharma Research and DaVita, and several other pro-business advocacy groups.</p>

<p>And here is a breakdown of the individuals who are supporting ColoradoCare. Medical professionals and educators are among the top fields:</p>

<p>The division is extremely clear cut: individuals and small-dollar donors are powering ColoradoCare while businesses and organizations are leading the fight against it - illustrating the challenges of policies that impact regular people and corporations in different ways.</p>

<p>The result of the Colorado ballot vote has broader ramifications beyond the state. ColoradoCare is the first major test of the movement to mainstream single-payer healthcare. The notoriously purple state will serve as a litmus test of the feasibility of implementing single-payer healthcare, the outcome of which will shape the healthcare debate in elections to come.</p>
