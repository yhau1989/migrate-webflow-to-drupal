<p>The impact of President Franklin D. Roosevelt dying in office -- then the subsequent revelations that his 'decisions' were often being made by the First Lady&nbsp;while incapacitated&nbsp;-- left a profound mark in our views of the presidency.</p>

<p>What was once considered private health information was now front-and-center in the information that Americans wanted to know about their president -- even more important than their finances.</p>

<p>But in 2016, we have a paradigm shift occurring, one that no one could have anticipated two years ago -- health concerns because of age is a primary issue.</p>

<hr>

<p>All but <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/06/how-health-concerns-pay-role-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 of our presidents</a> were under 60 years old at the time of election.</p>

<p>This year, the&nbsp;4 most popular candidates are over 60, with the oldest, Donald Trump, turning 70-years-old this past June.</p>

<p>No matter who wins, we will have <a href="http://robinsonlibrary.com/america/unitedstates/presidents/byage.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the oldest</a> (if not the oldest) presidents to have ever been elected.</p>

<p>But the track history for 60+ year-old presidents hasn't been too good, with only 8 of the 10 being able to complete their terms.</p>

<p>And while most Americans probably don't keep these facts and figures running around in their heads -- they intuitively realize that this year has the oldest field of candidates ever and they 'should' pause to think about it.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="All but 10 of our presidents were under 60 years old at the time of election." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/2016/08/31/oldest-presidential-field-u-s-history-prompts-health-concerns/" handle="yee_ivn" hashes="#didyouknow"]

<p>Frankly, with the entire field over 60 years old, it's actually surprising that health issues haven't been front-and-center for longer -- but that's the unpredictable nature of the winds of political campaigning.</p>

<p>But America is getting older and medicine has made leaps in age-related care. Senior citizens are competing in marathons, starting new careers, and going back to college.</p>

<p>The scrutiny that Ron Paul, Bob Dole, and John McCain all faced due to age is probably a thing of the past -- it's doubtful that a 60-year-old will ever be perceived as 'too old' for the presidency at this point.</p>

<p>But why the change in selecting men and women over 60 for a job that in the last 3 decades has been portrayed as a "young man's" job?</p>

<p>There's no 'good' reason for this, only a whole lot of speculation -- but a lot is probably driven by the fact that many voters throughout the political spectrum see America at a crossroads of change that will require great wisdom to navigate.</p>

<p>One by one through the primary season, the younger 'party darlings' dropped out -- their ideas, &nbsp;and often impetuous demeanor simply didn't ring true to voters.</p>

<p>What was left was a group of candidates asking voters to choose them because of their experience, leadership, and ideas (often in that order).</p>

<p>If one quality could be isolated in 2016, it seems the candidates are being judged on their experience more than any other quality.</p>

<hr>

<p>If anything, we should expect the attacks on the candidate's age and health to increase during this last push to November.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It seems to be one of the mudslinging issues that Americans love -- with political 'gotchas' relating to health having a long history of damaging and derailing campaigns.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="In a sense, it really is a vitality contest -- and one that all four candidates are doing a superb job of navigating." author=""]

<p>A Taft-style 'getting stuck in the bathtub' health jab seems to sell newspapers -- in modern politicking there seems to be no limits and nothing out-of-bounds.</p>

<p>In a sense, it really is a vitality contest -- and one that all four candidates are doing a superb job of navigating.</p>

<p>The next two months will be filled with candidate jet-setting, campaign fundraisers, and last minute appeals to voters -- with the occasional 'slow down' for the televised debates.</p>

<p>And that's the dual-edged nature of an 'experience' campaign when running for office -- you'll always have to face the flip-side of questions about health and vitality.</p>

<p>These attacks will likely sharpen in the final two months, because of their effectiveness at undermining the candidate's experience.</p>

<p>But even facing these attacks, there are no signs of slowing down out of any of the candidates.</p>
