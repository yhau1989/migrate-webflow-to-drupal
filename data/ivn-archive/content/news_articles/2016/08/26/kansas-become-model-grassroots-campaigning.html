<p>I've said throughout this election cycle that top-down campaigning won't have great results when it comes to independents and third-party candidates trying to affect change.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders came to <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/26/sanders-acknowledges-failures-top-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this position</a> after his primary loss, acknowledging that change must start at the bottom, penetrating all levels of government, and work its way to the highest levels of office.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for this -- oppressive state laws requiring significant hoop-jumping for ballot access, the stigma of independents and third-party candidates being 'spoilers,' and the fact that it's hard to rally the entire country around an idea without developing it first at the local levels.</p>

<p>In Kansas, anger at the incumbent governor's tax-cut plan, which has left the state with smaller than expected revenues each month for almost two years, has created a significant backlash against the solidly red conservative state legislature and federal seats.</p>

<p>But the fight isn't just starting at the legislative&nbsp;level; it's starting much, much lower in the political arena -- in township seats, mayoral positions, and judgeships.</p>

<p>In my own small town of Goddard, Ks., the mayor, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarceyGregoryForCountyCommission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcey Gregory</a> has embraced the independent ideals and runs city council meetings without partisanship -- and her political aims are higher for 2016, challenging Republican Karl Peterjohn for County Commissioner.</p>

<p>Gregory has long accused Peterjohn of <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article73792877.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasting the commission's time</a> by going on long partisan rants during meetings. She is hoping for change.</p>

<p>And the list of these grassroots independent candidates continues to grow, with the secretary of state's website listing 4 independent candidates for magistrate judge, and numerous independents challenging state legislative&nbsp;seats (<a href="http://www.kssos.org/elections/elections_upcoming_candidate_display.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list is not complete</a>, and is updated often).</p>

<p>This is the real plan of action for independents nationwide.</p>

<p>Sure, having independents or third-party candidates challenging national offices gets plenty of media coverage -- but it's hard to win without those in local and state offices able to change the laws that stack the deck in favor of the two-party duopoly.</p>

<p>Independents must, at the local level -- even in small towns -- show voters what running government without partisanship is really like.</p>

<p>Voters need to see this. They need to see that it works, because that is the only way to break so many of the stereotypes against independents and third-party candidates.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a successful election is always the standard by which campaigning is judged -- and independents have an uphill battle.</p>

<p>But continuing the fight to&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;the two-party lock on politics, regardless of previous losses, is the worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<p>Because as voters see how partisan-free politics works, more and more will stop to take notice of something we've been missing in this country for over 100 years -- real change. From the smallest local office to the presidency, real change will come when voters see the benefits in action.</p>
