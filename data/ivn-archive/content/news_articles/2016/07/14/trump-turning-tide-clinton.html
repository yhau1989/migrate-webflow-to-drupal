<p><span>Ahh, the ebbs and flows of a presidential campaign. </span></p>

<p><span>One day the polls say you have zero chance of winning, the next day you’re holding a slim lead.</span></p>

<p><span>So goes the battle between <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>.</span></p>

<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/351038-clinton-email-scandal-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>FBI investigation</span></a><span>, the drama of </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/14/politics/donald-trump-vice-president-us-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>picking a VP</span></a><span>, which according to several sources is going to be </span><a href="http://nypost.com/2016/07/14/trump-picks-indiana-governor-mike-pence-as-vp/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Indiana Governor Mike Pence</span></a><span>, and the many surrogates working hard to flood the airwaves with their talking points and finely coiffed hair and suits. It’s all very important and possibly game-changing stuff, but the larger question remains.</span></p>

<p><span>What is Donald J. Trump’s ceiling?</span></p>

<p><span>If you ask Paul Begala, Hillary Clinton’s super PAC strategist, he’ll tell you Trump's ceiling is right around 40%, which is where </span><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-tied-latest-national-poll/story?id=40571216" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>both candidates are currently polling.</span></a><span> Why is that important? A candidate will likely need close to 50% to win the White House. That equates to about 65 to 70 million votes. </span></p>

<p><span>Begala is working hard to keep Trump as close to 40% as he can, </span><span>“With Trump, he wants to build a wall; I want to build a ceiling. Right now he’s got his 40 percent of the vote and it is ironclad. I want to build a ceiling. We’ve been advertising very heavily on the outrageous things that Donald Trump has said about women, about national security, most powerfully about the disabled and that is building a ceiling. There is only one national poll out of ten or twelve that has him even over 40 and he has got to get close to 50.”</span></p>

<p><span>Trump was able to reach the 50% mark in late April and with the selection of his VP candidate Pence, he could begin to forge a lead over Mrs. Clinton nationally.</span></p>

<p><span>There’s also this. The Black Lives Matter movement could actually HELP Trump’s candidacy.</span></p>

<p><span>The decision by leaders of the </span><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/08/the-most-heinous-right-wing-reactions-to-dallas-shooting.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>BLM to continue protests</span></a><span> even after five white police officers were shot and killed in Dallas gave Trump a golden opportunity. Trump seized on it and has now labeled himself the </span><a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/07/11/trump_i_am_the_law_and_order_candidate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>“law and order” candidate</span></a><span>. With violence and disorder erupting nearly every week across the country, it could become harder and harder for a majority of Americans to turn their back on the “law and order” candidate.</span></p>

<p><span>Additionally, a new </span><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2016/07/13/evangelicals-rally-to-trump-religious-nones-back-clinton/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Pew poll shows Evangelicals </span></a><span>rushing to Trump’s side. Seventy-eight percent of white evangelical voters say they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, including about a third who “strongly” back his campaign.</span></p>

<p><span>All of this could mean a ceiling of closer to 55% nationally for America’s ultimate showman.</span></p>

<p><span>Still to be determined, though, is what impact, if any, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson could have on the race. The latest poll shows </span><a href="http://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2016/07/14/libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-still-rising-says-new-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Johnson at 12% nationally, up from 10% </span></a><span>just two months ago. If Johnson continues to climb and makes it into the national conversation and debates, he could very well have a big impact on the outcome.</span></p>

<p><span>But this is mid-July, and with the election still months away, anything, as we have seen in this campaign, is possible.</span></p>
