<p>San Diego-Comic-Con is in the house.</p>

<p>That house is the Convention Center in America's Finest City.</p>

<p>With the iconic convention in town -- for years the largest in San Diego -- it's a good opportunity to educate on the question that's become such a political football in San Diego.</p>

<p>Would a non-contiguous expansion of the Convention Center and possible Chargers stadium component have a damaging effect on tourism and attracting conventions to San Diego?</p>

<p>Here are arguments for a contiguous expansion of the Convention Center using the raw data compiled by the Center for Exhibition Industry Research (CEIR):</p>
<ul>
 	<li>An increase in mid-sized conventions and trade shows of between 7 and 8 events. Contiguous provides greater flexibility for events in this category.</li>
 	<li>Contiguous could result in retaining and/or capturing two events annually that require over 525,000 square feet of exhibit space.</li>
 	<li>Contiguous can better accommodate multiple overlapping events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are arguments for a non-contiguous expansion of the Convention Center.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>60% of conventions require less than 225,000 square feet (39 conventions)</li>
 	<li>31% of conventions fall between needing 225,000 and 525,000 square feet (20 conventions)</li>
 	<li>9% of conventions require more than 525,000 square feet ( 6 conventions. These conventions used the Sails Pavilion and ballrooms as exhibit space)</li>
 	<li>A campus-style expansion -- with or without a Chargers stadium component -- would create a 365 day a year use</li>
 	<li>San Diego has 12 competitors in the Convention Center space. Of those 12, nine have non-contiguous exhibit spaces, including Anaheim, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, one of those cities, Anaheim, compared a standard 160,000 contiguous expansion with a 180,000 "flex" space or non-contiguous option. The report found that the "flex" &nbsp;expansion would result in a "higher net incremental gain to the city."</p>
<h2><strong>Reaction</strong></h2>
<p>Chief Communications and Strategy Officer for Comic-Con David Glanzer, has made his feelings known over the issue of contiguous vs. non-contiguous.</p>

<p>Glanzer said:</p>
<blockquote>"The bottom line is any convention center expansion should be considered because of the value that new facility will bring to the city as a whole, and not just whether it can accommodate one convention." Glanzer continued, "We still believe strongly that a contiguous expansion is the best solution for the city. We will examine whatever the final decision is and try to work within whatever parameters we are given." - David Glanzer, Comic-Con International</blockquote>
<p>A couple small business owners in the East Village spoke to IVN San Diego. Due to the sensitive, political nature of this story, they didn't want to be identified. One high-profile business owner told IVN San Diego, "We love Comic-Con and all the energy it brings to downtown. I personally don't feel a contiguous or non-contiguous expansion would harm our business. But I do think we should have the Convention Center expanded one way or another. I just wish we could get a political consensus in this city."</p>
<h2><strong>Raising the TOT</strong></h2>
<p>Also at-issue, the arguments for and against raising the Transient Occupancy Tax from 12.5% to 15.5%. &nbsp;The City of San Diego collects at 10.5%. The local hoteliers collect an additional, and some would say illegal 2% on top of the city's portion. That 2% is about equal to 30 million dollars annually.</p>

<p>Those against raising the TOT argue it will kill tourism in San Diego and send tourists and convention bookers looking to spend their dollars elsewhere.</p>

<p>Those for the increase say it's high-time San Diego gets in line with Anaheim, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, who charge 17%, 16.25%, and 15.5% respectively.</p>

<p>The 15.5% rate would be 1.5% lower than what Anaheim charges. Has Anaheim been hurt by charging 17%?</p>

<p>The facts say no.</p>

<p>Their revenues in FY 11 and FY 12 grew 6 and 9%, respectively, and have continued to grow by a similar rate every year thereafter.</p>
