<p>IVN conducted a presidential poll from July 15-24 asking independent and independent-minded voters who they would vote for if the presidential election were&nbsp;held today. The results found that 78% of respondents would vote for a candidate other than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Receiving nearly&nbsp;32,000 responses, the IVN<span>&nbsp;survey posed three questions to respondents: 1. If the election were held today, which presidential candidate would you vote for? 2. Of the listed candidates (4-way race), who would you approve of being the next president? 3. Which political party, if any, best represents your views?</span></p>

<div><a href="https://infogr.am/71f429d6-96cb-478c-9cd5-d6706d9e8d29" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 Pres Poll Question 1</a><br><a href="http://charts.infogr.am/bar-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=bar_chart" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create bar charts</a></div>

<p>In the first question, which incorporates&nbsp;the choose-one, plurality voting method used in U.S. elections, Gary Johnson leads among the IVN audience with 35% of responses. Jill Stein came in second with 31%. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton polled at 13% and 9%, respectively, while a notable 12% wrote in an unlisted candidate.</p>

<p>The poll is not a proportional sampling of voters in the United States. However, while it further shows broad dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, it highlights&nbsp;a crucial&nbsp;reality&nbsp;about American politics:&nbsp;the media&nbsp;uses terrible metrics to gauge candidate viability.</p>

<p>When given an opportunity to vote for more than one candidate in a 4-way race between Trump, Clinton, Johnson, and Stein, support for the Libertarian and Green candidates was even higher. Under the approval method, Johnson and Stein each reached nearly 50% with Stein polling slightly higher at 49 percent to Johnson's 47 percent.</p>

<p>Clinton and Trump received a slight bump under the approval voting method, rising to 13% and 16%, respectively.</p>

<p>The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates selects 5 polls to identify viable presidential candidates. To be deemed viable, candidates must secure 15% in these polls. If a candidate does not meet this threshold, she or he cannot participate in the fall presidential debates and will be excluded from the national dialogue.</p>

<p>The polls&nbsp;the CPD looks at&nbsp;to determine eligibility use plurality voting, forcing respondents to choose only one candidate, even though -- as the IVN poll clearly shows -- they may be open to supporting (or at least hearing from) multiple candidates.</p>

<p>Further, many national polls don't give respondents options outside the Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>Johnson is polling close to the 15% threshold in some polls, but he still must clear a tall hurdle to gain access to the presidential debates. Though poll after poll show Americans want additional choices in elections, and over 4-in-1o Americans refuse to identify with either major party, horse-race polling to determine viability keeps&nbsp;"outside"&nbsp;voices from emerging on the national stage.</p>
