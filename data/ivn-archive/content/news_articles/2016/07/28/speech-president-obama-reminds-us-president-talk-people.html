<p>There is no question about it: President Obama can give a great speech.</p>

<p>And no, I’m not going to follow that up by saying, “but, he’s a terrible President.” Because he is not.</p>

<p>My President? Yes.</p>

<p>A good President? I personally believe so.</p>

<p>But is he right about our state of democracy? Not even close.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a> winning the presidency is that it was proof that the American voter could overcome institutional barriers that favor establishment candidates. In short, it proved that democracy was working.</p>

<p>Barack Obama won the presidency because there was a passion among average Americans, and that passion translated into votes. In short, he won by winning the hearts and minds of voters.</p>

<p>Problem is, <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> does not have that mandate from the American people. Throughout the primary, her 15 million votes represent less than <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/22/gop-turnout-spikes-open-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">8% of the voting-age population</a>. And, as of today, more than <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/06/15/official-two-worst-liked-nominees-ever/" rel="noopener noreferrer">half of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of her</a>.</p>

<p>But what is more troubling is the way she won. We all know now of the <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNC email scandal</a>, undeniable evidence that the “Democratic” Party worked within its private infrastructure and with the “free press” to <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/27/dnc-emails-show-private-parties-control-elections-not-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">make sure Bernie Sanders did not get the nomination</a>.</p>

<p>Many of us know how the “Democratic” Party kept primaries closed, requiring voters to register with the party <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/12/thought-arizona-bad-new-york-primaries-worse/" rel="noopener noreferrer">as early as 6 months before the election</a>, knowing it would favor Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Some of us know that the “Democratic” Party, in states like California, <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/03/31/ca-assembly-committee-denies-voters-access-to-presidential-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">actively opposed voting measures</a> that would make it easier for voters to understand and participate in the process.</p>

<p>And a few of us know how the “Democratic” Party used the same <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/18/whos-tinkering-voters-party-affiliations-new-york/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voter purging tactics</a> that they deride the Republican Party for using, so that voters who were more likely to vote for Bernie Sanders couldn't even cast a vote.</p>

<p>Does this mean Hillary Clinton is a terrible person? No. She’s just the figurehead of a system where democracy is in trouble, not on the incline.</p>

<p>No speech alone can repair that.</p>
