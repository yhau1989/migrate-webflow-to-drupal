<p>A lot of people are working hard to fix our broken system. Problem is, most people don’t know just how many important efforts are making strides because the media doesn’t spend much time talking about them.</p>

<p>So we are.</p>

<p>Voter disenfranchisement and disillusionment has been on the rise for a number of years, but there is something special about this presidential election season. Maybe it’s the fact that we now have the two most disliked presidential nominees in the history of modern politics.</p>

<p>In any case, there are many organizations fighting against the duopolistic control that the Democrat and Republican party machines exercise from local elections and legislation up to the federal level.</p>

<p>In order to keep the momentum moving throughout this election and after, it is important these organizations are publicized for their ongoing efforts. And, what better way to do so than to establish a monthly Nonpartisan Movement Update for readers and organizations?</p>

<p>Here’s what’s happening:</p>
<h3><b>Centrist Project</b></h3>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.centristproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Centrist Project</span></a><span> is an organization trying to break through the political gridlock occurring in Congress by electing five </span><a href="http://www.centristproject.org/candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>independent, centrist U.S. Senators</span></a><span> each election cycle with the help of moderate and independent Americans.</span></p>

<p>In May 2016, the Centrist Project announced its endorsement of Margaret Stock, independent candidate for U.S. Senate in Alaska.</p>

<h3><b>Crowdpac</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdpac.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Crowdpac</span></a><span> is an independent and nonpartisan platform that connects small donors to candidates and organizations to counter the influence big money donors have in swaying elections now. Crowdfunding campaigns makes it easier for anti-establishment and anti-corporate funding candidates to run for office. The organization’s central goal is to make American democracy more representative of the electorate.</span></p>

<p>Most recently, Crowdpac was a co-winner of the American Experiments Showcase held during the Democratic National Convention. American Experiments featured some of the top civic tech and political reform organizations trying to improve politics and elections with technology.</p>

<h3><b>FairVote</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.fairvote.org/our_story#fair_elections" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>FairVote</span></a><span> is a non-profit organization founded in 1992. Its goal is to make democracy fair, functional, and more representative by studying and advocating for electoral reforms such as proportional representation, ranked choice voting, and universal voter registration.</span></p>

<p><span>This November, voters in Maine will have an opportunity to vote on ballot initiative, </span><a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Question 5</span></a><span>, which would implement ranked choice voting in all statewide elections. If passed, Maine will be the first in the nation to implement this democratic reform for all statewide elections. </span><a href="http://www.fairvote.org/rcv#rcvbenefits" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>According to FairVote</span></a><span>, this electoral reform promotes majority support of candidates, discourages negative campaigning, and provides more choice for voters.</span></p>

<p><span>In April, FairVote </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/15/fairvote-joins-lawsuit-to-open-presidential-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>joined</span></a><span> Level the Playing Field, the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party in a&nbsp;lawsuit against the FEC over the CPD’s exclusionary 15% threshold rule. The plaintiffs argue the threshold serves to keep out unwanted competition.</span></p>

<h3><b>Independent Voter Project</b></h3>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/who_we_are" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Independent Voter Project</span></a><span> began in 2006 with a simple mission statement: Democracy functions best when the most people participate. In an effort to break California’s political gridlock and make the state’s elections competitive, IVP authored California’s Proposition 14 in 2010, which established the state’s Top Two Nonpartisan open primary. Now, IVP is developing a state-by-state legal strategy to challenge closed partisan primary systems nationwide.</span></p>

<p><span>In April, </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/13/debates-commission-monopoly-reduces-competition/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>IVP filed an amicus brief</span></a><span> with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., in the case </span><i><span>Level the Playing Field, et.al. v. Federal Election Commission</span></i><span>. IVP states the CPD is a partnership between two private political parties and therefore has a fiduciary duty to preserve the interests of the two private groups at the expense of the larger population.</span></p>

<p><span>As an ongoing project, IVP is a publisher of </span><a href="http://ivn.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>IVN.us</span></a><span>, a nonpartisan open platform for all independent-minded readers, voters, and organizations to publish unfiltered political news and policy analysis. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>Better For America</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.betterforamerica.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Better For America</span></a><span> (BFA) is creating a pathway for an independent presidential candidate to be on the ballot in all 50 states to provide Americans with a candidate they can vote for, rather than against. Nearly two-thirds of Americans want an alternative candidate for president, according to Better for America.</span></p>
<blockquote><span>“Millions of dollars and millions of votes later the American people are still clearly unsatisfied with the two major party nominees,” Kahlil Byrd, Senior Advisor to Better For America </span><a href="https://www.betterforamerica.com/better_for_america_in_philadelphia_building_coalitions" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>explains</span></a><span>. “We say there is still hope for another choice to unite us all.”</span></blockquote>
<p>In June, BFA filed a motion in federal court to join Level the Playing Field’s lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission arguing that the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is not nonpartisan and actively works to exclude minor parties from the debate stage.</p>

<p><span>Most recently, BFA travelled to the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention to continue </span><a href="https://www.betterforamerica.com/better_for_america_in_philadelphia_building_coalitions" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>building their coalition</span></a><span> and partnerships on the ground.</span></p>

<h3><b>Let Colorado Vote</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.letcovote2016.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Let Colorado Vote</span></a><span> is a nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase voter participation in Colorado. More than 34% of Colorado’s active voters are unaffiliated and therefore cannot participate in the primary elections without first joining a political party.</span></p>

<p>This year, Let Colorado Vote (LCV) is placing two initiatives on the November ballot to 1) restore a presidential primary and 2) open primary elections to the state’s 1.3 million unaffiliated voters. LCV is currently gathering signatures and will turn them into the Colorado Secretary of State in August to be certified for the November ballot.</p>

<h3><b>Level the Playing Field</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.changetherule.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Level the Playing Field</span></a><span> (LPF) is currently suing the Federal Elections Commission over the CPD’s 15% polling threshold to make it into the presidential debates. LPF filed the lawsuit in June of last year. Since then, many organizations such as Better For America, FairVote, and the Independent Voter Project have signed on in support of LPF’s argument.</span></p>

<p><span>The plaintiffs argue that while a 15 percent polling threshold may seem reasonable, a candidate actually needs 60 to 80 percent name recognition to poll at 15 percent. </span></p>

<p><span>However, the mainstream media does not cover third party or independent candidates as much as their Democrat and Republican competitors. Reaching the 15 percent threshold is therefore almost insurmountable. A candidate would have to spend nearly $260 million in ad buys, </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/06/29/supporters-join-lawsuit-open-presidential-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>reports</span></a><span> Level the Playing Field.</span></p>
<blockquote><span>“When 43 percent of American voters refuse to identify with either the Democrats or Republicans, we need to work for political reforms that open up the system and allow those voices to be represented in our democracy,” Cara McCormick, President of Level the Playing Field </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/21/taxpayers-spent-half-billion-dollars-on-party-primaries-in-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>explained</span></a><span> in an interview for IVN.</span></blockquote>

<h3><b>Open Primaries</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/mission" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Open Primaries</span></a><span> is a movement of Americans who believe that everyone should be able to vote without having to join a political party. Its&nbsp;mission is to advocate for open, nonpartisan primaries all over the United States.</span></p>

<p>Beginning in June, Open Primaries began a petition calling on the DNC and RNC Rules Committees to amend their primary rules in favor of open primaries. Open Primaries delivered 40,000 signatures to both parties during the July conventions.</p>

<p><span>Recent </span><a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/taxpayer_costs_of_closed_primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>research</span></a><span> conducted by Open Primaries reveals the staggering cost taxpayers shelled out for the presidential primaries this year, even though 26.3 million voters in closed primary states were excluded. </span><a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/taxpayer_costs_of_closed_primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Take a look</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Also, be sure to take a look at the recent effort in South Dakota to establish nonpartisan open elections. </span><a href="https://voteyesonv.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Amendment V</span></a><span> will be on the November ballot.</span></p>
