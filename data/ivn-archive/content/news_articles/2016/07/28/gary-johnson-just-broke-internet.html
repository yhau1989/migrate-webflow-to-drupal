<p>As the Democratic Party wraps up their convention, Gary Johnson posted on Facebook, encouraging his supports to demand that he be included in the debates:</p>

<p><em>Hillary will call Donald an egomaniac. Donald will call Hillary crooked.</em></p>

<p><em>Neither one will debate about the issues that matter to the American people.</em></p>

<p><em>SIGN THE PETITION to demand Gov. Gary Johnson be included in the Presidential Debates:</em></p>

<p>Within less than one minute, thousands of "likes," "shares," and petition signers were sending his post viral. So many, in fact, that according to campaign insiders, NationBuilder, the world's most innovative campaign platform, couldn't handle the traffic.</p>

<p>A sign that Americans are ready to consider a&nbsp;third option? Probably.</p>

<p>Proof that Gary Johnson should be let into the debates? Absolutely.</p>
