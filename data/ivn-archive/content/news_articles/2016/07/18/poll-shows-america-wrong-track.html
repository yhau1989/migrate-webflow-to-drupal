<p><strong>(CLEVELAND, OH)</strong> -- As the Republican and Democratic Conventions are about to kickoff, poll after poll continue to prove Americans deserve a better choice for president. According to a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterforamerica.com/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fap-gfkpoll.com%2F&amp;e=1ffd2624cedefabb22a733f94a636dbb&amp;utm_source=betterforamerica&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20160717_pr_p&amp;n=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press-GfK poll</a>, an average of 75 percent of Americans would NOT be proud to have one of the major party candidates as their president. With only 22 percent approving of Trump and 27 percent who want to see Clinton in the White House, the poll showed, “three-quarters of Americans consider Trump to be only slightly or not at all civil, and half say he’s at least somewhat racist...three-quarters consider Clinton to be only slightly or not at all honest, and most think her use of a private email address and server while she was secretary of state broke the law."</p>

<p>It is no surprise that the poll also revealed that a stunning 79 percent of Americans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction -- a 15-point increase in the past year. Combined with the high dissatisfaction rates of the two likely nominees, Better For America believes Americans deserve better than two candidates that are deeply unfavorable among a majority of the people they claim to represent.</p>

<p>Better for America (BFA), a nonpartisan organization establishing ballot access for an independent candidate to run for president in 2016, is clearing the pathway for a candidate to emerge who demonstrates honor, lives with integrity and will lead America in the right direction.</p>

<p>“Americans clearly want a President who will put country before party and be a leader who can unite the country, not continue to divide us,” said Anne MacDonald, Executive Director for Better For America. “With 79 percent of Americans believing we’re on the wrong track, and a choice between two candidates with sky-high unfavorables, Better For America is working hard to bring another choice to the American people,” MacDonald added.</p>

<p>To drive the point home, a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterforamerica.com/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.langerresearch.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F1179a2BeforetheConventions.pdf&amp;e=1ffd2624cedefabb22a733f94a636dbb&amp;utm_source=betterforamerica&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20160717_pr_p&amp;n=3" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC poll</a>&nbsp;found that 64 percent of Americans see Trump unfavorably and 54 percent see Clinton unfavorably corroborating the continued trend defining them as the two most unpopular presumptive nominees in ABC/Post polling back to 1984.</p>

<p>In response to the poll, host of ABC's “This Week,” George Stephanopoulos, said, “Majorities of Republicans and Democrats now say they are voting against the other side rather than for their own candidate. Some pretty sobering numbers there.” Better For America believes voters shouldn’t have to vote against someone, but should have a choice that they can vote for.</p>

<p>BFA is building a pathway for an independent candidate to launch a presidential run through conventional ballot access measures and constitutional legal challenges to unduly restrictive state ballot requirements. In this year of unprecedented dissatisfaction with the two party candidates, this pathway will provide a leader with honor, integrity and one who can unite America the opportunity to compete in nearly all states and for substantially all votes in the Electoral College.</p>
