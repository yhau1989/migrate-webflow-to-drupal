<p>Support for Libertarian <strong>Gary Johnson</strong>&nbsp;continues to grow, according to&nbsp;the newest poll by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/polls-find-clinton-leading-in-4-key-swing-states-1468555202" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist</a>. The poll shows&nbsp;double-digit strength in both Virginia and Colorado.</p>

<p>While Johnson has had&nbsp;an average national showing of&nbsp;<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pay-attention-to-libertarian-gary-johnson-hes-pulling-10-vs-trump-and-clinton/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 percent</a>&nbsp;for several months (polling as high as <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/17/rel8a.-.2016.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 percent</a> in one poll), the nature of a federal republic makes each state's results all that really matters. A double-digit showing in two hotly contested <a href="http://www.270towin.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">battleground states</a> represents a huge impact on the overall race.</p>

<p>In light of these continued double-digit polling results, two thoughts remain.</p>

<p>First, why are so many national polls not even including Johnson or Stein as options?</p>

<p>It still appears like the mainstream media is <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/11/national-polls-largely-exclude-stein-johnson-as-voters-increasingly-want-more-options/" rel="noopener noreferrer">purposefully ignoring the minor party candidates</a>, even with this being the best showing from 'outsiders' since H. Ross Perot's two failed&nbsp;presidential campaigns in the 1990s.</p>

<p>A review of polls shows that 'other' and/or&nbsp;'undecided' still remain the two most common options other than the major party nominees.</p>

<p>Second, we'd better start looking at the historical data.</p>

<p>From George Wallace's failed 1968 attempt to Perot's attempts in the 1990s, once a candidate begins to poll this high at this stage of the campaign, their interest either holds or grows.</p>

<p>With the 'never-Trump' movement <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/15/rnc-rules-committee-kills-nevertrump-movement-one-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially killed</a> by the rules committee requiring delegates to be bound to their pledges, dissatisfied Republicans are going to be looking for other options.</p>

<p>Clinton's continued scandals and inability to lock in Sanders' supporters only fuels this surge for the minor party candidates.</p>

<p>The question remains whether either minor party candidate will break the all-important 15 percent threshold to be included in the debates with the major candidates, who are not encumbered by any requirements other than their party's nod.</p>

<p>Without breaking this threshold or a significant change in the presidential debate rules (which is&nbsp;unlikely), neither minor party candidate will get the critical&nbsp;platform of having their ideas presented and debated against what Clinton and Trump have to offer.</p>

<p>One thing is now almost certain, this year's winner with join the other 16 presidents who won by less-than-majority pluralities.</p>

<p>Or it could get even wilder in 2016 with no candidate collecting 50 percent of the electoral votes, creating only the third instance (1800 &amp; 1824) where the House of Representatives selects the president and the second instance (1836) of the Senate choosing our vice president.</p>
