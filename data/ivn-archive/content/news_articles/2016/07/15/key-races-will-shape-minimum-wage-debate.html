<p>Few political battles have waged as intensely as the campaign to raise the minimum wage. Proponents insist raising the wage is critical to lifting working families from poverty while opponents insist that an increase could devastate small businesses. Yet one can sometimes feel detached by the apparent impossibility of having real impact on the debate and moving the issue forward. But it turns out that normal people can in fact have a effect real change. The key is to go local.</p>

<p>While the federal level remains in gridlock, cities have been able to move forward with minimum wage increases, sometimes in stark contrast to their stateâ€™s regulations.</p>

<p>We've identified five key races that are likely to reshape the minimum wage debate. They are the hidden battlefields in a debate that has claimed headlines across the country. Each mayor has made their own statement on the minimum wage and taken on their city councils, local interest groups, and even their state governors to advocate for their side.</p>

Below you will find in-depth information on why each city made the list.</p>
