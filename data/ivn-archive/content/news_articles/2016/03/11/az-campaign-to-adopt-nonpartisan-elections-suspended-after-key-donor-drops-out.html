<p><em>Correction note: This article originally said that Open Primaries spent $300,000 in support of the donation disclosure initiative. It was the coalition in support of both initiatives. The article has been corrected.</em></p>

<p>Salon reported Thursday that a campaign to adopt nonpartisan elections in Arizona suspended its efforts&nbsp;after a major donor dropped out.</p>

<p>Texas billionaire John Arnold had contributed at least $1 million in support of the campaign to adopt a&nbsp;nonpartisan, top-two open primary similar to the systems in California and Washington state&nbsp;through the organization <strong><a href="http://openprimaries.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Primaries</a></strong>. He later learned that nearly half of his donations were going toward another initiative.</p>

<p>This second ballot measure would require that groups who spend money to influence elections disclose any donations exceeding $10,000. The coalition in support of both initiatives&nbsp;spent $300,000 of his donations in support of this initiative.</p>

<p>Arnold voiced his opposition to this funding and $178,000 of his donation was returned this week. The two former Phoenix mayors who were benefiting from Arnoldâ€™s contributions have suspended their campaign in support of the nonpartisan, top-two primary until they can find alternate sources of funds.</p>
