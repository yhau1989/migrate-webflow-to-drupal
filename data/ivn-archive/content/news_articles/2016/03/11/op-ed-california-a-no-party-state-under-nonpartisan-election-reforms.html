<p>On Thursday, March 10, <strong>Sherry Bebitch Jeffe</strong> and <strong>Douglas Jeffe</strong> published a column in Reuters about the impact nonpartisan election&nbsp;reforms are having in California, including independent redistricting and the nonpartisan, top-two open primary (authored by the <strong><a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a></strong>). They conclude that while California may appear to be a one-party state, it has actually become a "no party state."</p>
<blockquote>A consequential change has been the implementation of the “top two” primary. Under this system, all candidates for a legislative, congressional or statewide office compete on a single primary ballot. Voters then choose between the two top vote-getters — regardless of party affiliation — in the general election. No longer are there closed primaries in which the most liberal candidate generally prevails in Democratic districts, and hard-right conservatives dominate the Republican districts.

&nbsp;

Under the new rules, campaigns increasingly look to the entire electorate in primaries, not just to the party faithful. In several legislative and congressional races, this has meant run-offs between two contenders from the same party. Independents and voters of the opposition party often hold the balance of power.</blockquote>
<p>Voter approved reforms such as the nonpartisan, top-two open primary, independent redistricting commission, simple majority vote to approve a state budget, and term limit reform are highlighted as contributing factors to&nbsp;the "moderate California."</p>

<p>The authors claim that while the majority of voters are driven by positions generally supported by Democrats, because of the voter-driven measures mentioned above, the once fiercely partisan nature of the legislature has shifted toward the center. They're not sure if this is a break from the political dysfunction of the recent past or a political trend that could, as so many before have, spread nationwide.</p>

<p>"All things considered, though, politics and governance seem to be functioning far better in California than in Washington — or on the presidential campaign trail. At a time when “moderate” has become a dirty word on the national scene, California government is functioning — and functioning well — pretty much in the middle of the road," the authors write.</p>

<p>The Independent Voter Project is sponsoring a new resolution that calls for the adoption of a <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/03/03/california-resolution-would-provide-for-a-nonpartisan-public-ballot-option-for-presidential-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nonpartisan "public ballot" option</a> in presidential primary elections in order to ensure that all voters have an opportunity to voice their preference in the presidential election, regardless of their party affiliation or preference.</p>

<p>The resolution would not eliminate party ballots, but would&nbsp;simply give voters the&nbsp;option to vote on a ballot with all qualifying candidates on it (regardless of party) if they do not want to participate in a party's primary election or are barred from doing so by the party. The resolution is currently before the Assembly Elections Committee.</p>
