<p>On Thursday, I was astonished to see someone argue that the gridlock and hopeless partisanship we see in Washington are just phenomenalized by the news, and that our politicians 'really do' work together.</p>

<p>This is, of course, vastly different than what we usually perceive our government to be doing -- between the budget shutdowns, refusal to hear SCOTUS nominations, and the sheer number of &nbsp;bills dying from lack of cloture -- we have gridlock. But just how bad is it?</p>
<ul>
	<li><span>In the first six months of 2015, 33 filibuster attempts were led to block&nbsp;legislation, with just under half were successful;</span></li>
	<li><span>During the same time, the Senate only managed to get 6 of its own bills to the president's desk for signature, and only 30 got through their chamber (a record low since the 1930s);</span></li>
	<li><span>The House was a bit more productive, passing 166 bills, but only 21 became&nbsp;law.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it's been pretty grim in Washington.</p>

<p>To be fair, gridlock is not all bad. "That government is best which governs least," is as true today as when Thoreau wrote it in&nbsp;<em>Civil Disobedience</em>. A slow, cumbersome government that doesn't get a lot done can often be the best recipe for government, though there are often too many issues that need addressed for government to hide behind partisan gridlock indefinitely.</p>

<p>America is currently divided on many ideological and cultural lines: the Red/Blue divide, the Urban/Rural divide, Religious divides (i.e. the so-called War on Christianity), and a culture that is rapidly becoming a "non-majority" culture.</p>

<p>Even within the political parties there have been growing pains -- a bit more apparent in the Republican Party, but the Democrats are facing some troubles as well. The anti-establishment movement in the GOP may cause a fundamental split in what it means to be a conservative after the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Likewise, the liberal voice of the Democratic Party, refusing to go unheard, is demanding that the party cater to their liberal agenda, rather than play&nbsp;it safe during an election year.</p>

<p>In short, we don't have gridlock just in Congress; the parties themselves are hopelessly stuck in redefining their identities, and no one seems quite happy about the outcomes.</p>

<p>My personal take on the 2016 presidential election is that it's going to be a 'placeholder' election. Gridlock will prevail, the parties will be battered from the hostile races, and they will spend then next 4 years figuring out their platforms for the 2020 election. 2020 will probably be vastly different than 2016 -- the fundamental nature of both parties is likely to be substantially different.</p>

<p>With the Democrats likely to retake the Senate, this only makes the potential for rampant partisanship worse, with Republicans using the cloture feature as the weapon for the term.</p>

<p>It won't be all bad, most of the federal judges approved will have to be universally liked moderates, as neither party will have enough of an edge to get a party-line judge through the nomination process.</p>

<p>Either way, I think we need to sit tight and be prepared for another 4 years of solid gridlock, and start thinking towards 2020 to advance the independent agenda.</p>
