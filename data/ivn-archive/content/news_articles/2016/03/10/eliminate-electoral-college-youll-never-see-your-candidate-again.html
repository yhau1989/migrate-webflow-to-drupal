<p>As a follower of politics, I love seeing all the hair-brained ideas that sprout up from time-to-time arguing for this change or that, without really considering what would happen if it was actually put into practice.</p>

<p>We live in a federal republic. Big states have a larger share of influence, but smaller states still maintain at least some balance through the equal representation in the Senate.</p>

<p>The Electoral College was part of this framework. Presidential candidates had to win at the state-level, but an enormous win in one state couldn't skew the entire result.</p>

<p>That is, a candidate might win 99% of the vote in California and it wouldn't matter; they only win the delegates apportioned to the state.</p>

<p>This highlights the problems with eliminating the Electoral College; the very nature of campaigning would change, and most Americans would never see a candidate again.</p>

<p>America is <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/07/15/urbanization-nation-means-american-politics-2015/" rel="noopener noreferrer">facing growing urbanization</a>&nbsp;-- almost 81 percent of the population lives in cities.</p>

<p>Even worse, right at one-third of the U.S.'s total population lives in <strong><em><span>only ten metropolitan areas!</span></em></strong></p>

<p>We're used to the battleground state phenomenon, where states become flyovers because they are pocketed wins. However,&nbsp;if we eliminated the Electoral College, candidates could campaign in the top 20 metro areas and win the lion's share of votes.</p>

<p>This would be a politicking nightmare -- candidates jockeying to dominate the airwaves in the markets with the most people, while others totally ignore&nbsp;the rural and nationwide vote.</p>

<p>The biggest losers, though, would be the Republicans.</p>

<p>The red/blue map is often dominated by where the urban regions are located. Solid swaths of red are typically wide spreads of rural America.</p>

<p>Whether we like to admit it or not, the <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/07/15/urbanization-nation-means-american-politics-2015/" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban/rural divide</a> is often represented in the red/blue map -- and forcing candidates to campaign along the urban/rural divide would be a stacked deck in favor of the Democrats.</p>

<p>Our Founders knew that they weren't forming a perfect form of government, that's why they allowed for a mechanism for change. But to think that we should change to a system where Democrats could campaign in 20 cities while Republicans scramble to unify the rural areas, how would this improve the existing system?</p>
