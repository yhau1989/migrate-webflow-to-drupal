<p>Retired neurosurgeon <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/ben-carson/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Ben Carson</a> told his supporters on Wednesday that&nbsp;he does <em>“not see a political path forward.”</em> Though he did not formally suspend his campaign, he announced&nbsp;that he will not be attending the&nbsp;Republican debate on Thursday.</p>

<p>Carson wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/realbencarson/posts/603149516518185" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post:</a></p>
<blockquote><em>“I have decided not to attend the Fox News GOP Presidential Debate tomorrow night in Detroit. Even though I will not be in my hometown of Detroit on Thursday, I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America. I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening’s Super Tuesday primary results. However, this grassroots movement on behalf of ‘We the People’ will continue. Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to Saving America for Future Generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>I appreciate the support, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America. Gratefully, my campaign decisions are not constrained by finances; rather by what is in the best interests of the American people.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>I will discuss more about the future of this movement during my speech on Friday at CPAC in Washington, D.C.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>– Ben”</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/02/carson-advisor-pours-cold-water-on-senate-rumors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to The Daily Caller, Carson will not likely run for an open seat in the Florida Senate as previously <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/florida-playbook" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a>&nbsp;briefly&nbsp;by Politico.</p>

<p>Dr. Carson rose to political fame in 2013 after&nbsp;criticizing policies of&nbsp;President Barack Obama&nbsp;while&nbsp;Obama&nbsp;sat&nbsp;a few feet away during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFb6NU1giRA" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech</a> he gave at the National Prayer Breakfast. In November, Carson rose to the top of the political polls and his message of being an <em>“outsider”</em>&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;resonate with voters.</p>

<p>Dr. Carson&nbsp;made some&nbsp;<a href="http://truthinmedia.com/ben-carson-secure-us-mexico-border-drone-strikes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial statements</a> during his campaign, and began to lose voter support following a growing&nbsp;perception of <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/26/ben-carson-responds-donald-trumps-super-low-energy-charge/" rel="noopener noreferrer">being</a>&nbsp;<em>“low energy.”</em></p>

<p>Dr. Carson has a scheduled speech at CPAC this year and will be giving details to his supporters about the future plans of his <em>“grassroots movement.”</em></p>
