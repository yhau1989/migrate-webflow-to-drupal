<p><strong><span>WASHINGTON</span>, <span>March 14, 2016</span> /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> --&nbsp;The National Press Club on Monday raised concerns about the increasing attacks and threats against journalists covering <span>the United States</span> presidential campaign, particularly after multiple unsettling reports from <span>Donald Trump</span> events. The Press Club urges all candidates and their teams to support freedom of the press, and to respect journalists playing a vital role in U.S. democracy.</p>

<p>"<span>The United States</span> should be an example for the rest of the world in how we protect the right of journalists to report," said National Press Club President <span>Thomas Burr</span>. "As candidates talk about freedom and rights so treasured by Americans, they should underscore that one of the most basic of those rights is the freedom of the press. And they should make sure that right is carried out in practice."</p>

<p>The National Press Club, founded in 1908 and based in <span>Washington, D.C.</span>, is the world's leading professional organization for journalists. Through its Press Freedom Committee, the club promotes transparency and free expression worldwide.</p>
