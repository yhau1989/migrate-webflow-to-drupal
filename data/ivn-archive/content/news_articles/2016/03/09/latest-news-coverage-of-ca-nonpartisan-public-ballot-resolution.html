<p>On Friday, February&nbsp;26, California Assemblymember <strong>Kristin Olsen</strong> and State Senator <strong>Anthony Cannella</strong>, with the support of the <strong><a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a></strong>, filed a resolution with the California State Assembly urging Secretary of State <strong>Alex Padilla</strong> to create an additional nonpartisan, presidential ballot that lists all presidential candidates, regardless of party.</p>

<p>California would continue to distribute partisan primary ballots for voters registered with a qualifying political party, but the resolution would allow for the creation of a nonpartisan "public ballot" for voters who either can't vote because a political party bars their participation or don't want to vote in a particular party's primary election.</p>
