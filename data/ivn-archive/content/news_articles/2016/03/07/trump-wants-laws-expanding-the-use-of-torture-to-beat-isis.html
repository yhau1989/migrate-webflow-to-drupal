<p>After he was criticized for claiming&nbsp;that he could force the United States military to break the current law banning torture methods like waterboarding, <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> backtracked his comments and said instead that he would like to change the laws to include waterboarding <em>“at a minimum.”</em></p>

<p>Trump has been vocal in the past regarding&nbsp;the issue of how to deal with suspected terrorists, and in December he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that not only should the U.S. target terrorists, but also their families.</p>

<p><em>“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,”</em> Trump said. <em>“They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”</em></p>

<p>Trump has also voiced support for bringing back waterboarding. In November, he <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-bring-back-waterboarding/story?id=35354443" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>,<em>“I think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they do to us.”</em></p>

<p>When asked about his stance on waterboarding at a GOP debate in February, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/06/transcript-of-the-feb-6-gop-debate-annotated/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he would <em>“bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,”</em> because in the Middle East, <em>“we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people.”</em></p>

<p>In response to Trump’s comments, former NSA and CIA Director Michael Hayden said&nbsp;that Trump’s plans to target the families of terrorists, and to bring back <em>“enhanced interrogation techniques”</em> that are <em>“worse than waterboarding,” </em>would result in the American armed forces refusing to act.</p>

<p>“<em>[U.S. military personnel] are</em>&nbsp;<em>not required — in fact you are required not to follow an unlawful order,” </em>Hayden said<em>. “That would be in violation of all the international laws of armed conflict.</em>”</p>

<p>During a GOP debate Thursday, Fox News Host Bret Baier <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/03/the-fox-news-gop-debate-transcript-annotated/" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a> Trump what he would do if the military <em>“refused to carry out”</em> his orders.</p>
