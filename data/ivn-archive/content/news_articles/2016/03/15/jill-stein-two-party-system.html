 argues that&nbsp;“[t]he Democratic Party has a very clear track record of sabotaging rebels."<p>In a <a href="http://grist.org/politics/meet-the-presidential-candidate-who-makes-bernie-sanders-look-conservative/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview</a> with <strong>Katie Herzog</strong> from <a href="http://grist.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grist</a>, Green Party presidential candidate&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.ivn.us/tag/jill-stein" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jill Stein</a></strong></p>

<p>Stein is referring to the fact that even though Democratic presidential candidate <strong><a href="http://www.ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong> is upsetting the contest by winning states like Michigan, <strong><a href="http://www.ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> will likely be the nominee.</p>
<blockquote>"The party does this fake go-left thing by allowing genuine reformers to be seen and heard, but they never allow them to go all the way. You can’t really have a revolutionary campaign inside a counter-revolutionary party,” Stein tells Herzog.</blockquote>
<p>Just look back to the 1988 presidential primary contest, Stein says, when <strong>Jesse Jackson</strong> won 11 major primaries and was taken out by a fear campaign started by the Democratic Party itself.</p>

<p>Herzog and Stein are not alone in feeling that the Democratic Party will hand the nomination to Clinton and it's easy to see why,&nbsp;Herzog explains.</p>

<p><em>"<strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz</strong>, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, co-chaired Clinton’s 2008 bid for the White House. Wasserman Schultz is also in control of the debate schedule and <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article57101568.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">she’s been accused</a> of using that power to limit Sanders’ exposure to voters. Originally, the DNC scheduled only six Democratic debates — far fewer than the Republicans, and far fewer than the DNC held during the 2008 race. One was during an NFL playoff game."</em></p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that third parties aren't allowed to participate in these primary or general election debates, so winning the general election for a third-party candidate is an overwhelming obstacle that is nearly impossible with the current electoral system.</p>

<p>But, Stein tells Herzog that she has a plan to win the presidency and it involves cancelling the student loan debt of 43 million Americans. If all of these Americans voted, it would grant Stein a plurality of the votes to win the general election.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as Stein mentions and as many Americans remember, the popular vote sometimes fails to elect presidents. "This is one of the many problems with our electoral process," Stein adds, "it is a system designed to discourage people from voting."</p>
