<p>Libertarian Party candidate <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a></strong>, who ran as the Libertarian nominee in 2012 and garnered over a million votes in the&nbsp;general election, is polling in the double digits&nbsp;in a three-way race against major party front-runners&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong>. The Washington Times <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/24/libertarian-gary-johnson-double-digits-race-agains/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Thursday</a> that a new Monmouth University poll shows Johnson with 11 percent against Trump (34%) and Clinton (42%).</p>

<p>While that does not sound like a lot, keep in mind that Johnson is getting little to no media attention, doesn't have near the fundraising or cash-on-hand as Clinton or Trump, and has yet to be named the Libertarian nominee. Johnson is polling&nbsp;at 11 percent in an election system that is designed to minimize the presence and support of outside candidates.</p>

<p>As no candidate comes close to majority support, it is clear that many Americans are simply not satisfied with what the major parties are offering.</p>

<p>The Washington Times reports:</p>
<blockquote>"More than three-quarters of respondents didn’t know enough about <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gary-johnson/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Johnson</a>, the former New Mexico governor and 2012 presidential candidate, to have formed an opinion. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gary-johnson/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Johnson</a> received more than 1 million votes in 2012 — a record for a

&nbsp;

Libertarian candidate — which amounted to about 1 percent of the popular vote.

But 40 percent of registered voters said they had a favorable opinion of <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mrs. Clinton</a>, compared to 51 percent with an unfavorable one.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Trump</a> fared even worse, with 30 percent reporting a favorable opinion of him and 60 percent viewing him unfavorably."</blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Johnson, he is an entrepreneur and served as governor of New Mexico for 8 years from 1995 to 2003.&nbsp;From a broad perspective, Johnson's campaign is founded on the ideas of personal freedom and responsibility and making one's own choices as long as it doesn't negatively affect others.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://garyjohnson2016.com/issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer">specifically</a>, Johnson supports replacing income and payroll taxes with a consumption-based tax system, congressional term limits, a more noninterventionist foreign policy, comprehensive criminal justice reform that would reduce the number of nonviolent felons, and marijuana legalization.</p>

<p>Public opinion polls consistently show that a broad range of voters could potentially get behind the platform of a candidate like Johnson. Americans are also angry with a system that tells them their vote doesn't count. Voters feel unrepresented&nbsp;in government and with the only two real choices they are given each election, the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>

<p>Where will many <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong> supporters go when the primary season is finished? A Clinton campaign with no enthusiasm or populist appeal? Where will the anti-Trump movement turn? There is a case to be made that 2016 will see the strongest showing from a third party candidate and past election results and polling suggest that Johnson is going to be that third party candidate.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to IVN as we explore further the viability of a Johnson presidential campaign.</p>
