<p>Today, Arizona voters are headed to the polls to decide which presidential candidates they prefer to take&nbsp;the 58 delegates in the Republican contest and 75 delegates on the Democratic contest. However, more than 1.2 million citizens in Arizona&nbsp;– more than a third of all registered voters in the state – <a href="http://www.fox10phoenix.com/web/ksaz/politics/110953547-story" rel="noopener noreferrer">won't be allowed to cast a ballot</a>.</p>

<p>The presidential preference election (PPE) is only open to members of the Democratic, Republican, and Green parties, meaning that voters&nbsp;registered as independent or with another party can't vote on which presidential candidate they prefer. The last day a voter could have registered with one of the three parties conducting an election Tuesday was February 22. Arizona does not allow same-day registration.</p>

<p>As a result, voter confusion has marred the process, <a href="http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/31531970/presidential-preference-election-causing-confusion-among-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">with reports</a> of independent voters missing that deadline and finding out too late that they are ineligible to cast a ballot. Some voters will likely take the time to travel to their local polling location&nbsp;and line up, only to be turned away.</p>

<p>In addition, the PPE is state-funded and administered, meaning that all of the voters who cannot participate in the elections are still paying for them.</p>

<p>Technically, a PPE is different from a primary election since only presidential candidates are on the ballot.&nbsp;Arizona will conduct&nbsp;primary elections for other statewide and congressional office on August 30. Unlike the PPE, independent voters will be able to&nbsp;participate but they have to request a Republican or Democratic ballot.</p>

<p>A bill sponsored by Arizona House Speaker David Gowan <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/house-votes-to-repeal-presidential-preference-elec/" rel="noopener noreferrer">would repeal state funding for the PPE</a>, forcing the political parties to raise the funds for the election themselves. It passed a vote in the House, but even if it clears the Senate and is signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey, it won't affect this year's election.</p>
