<p>As of the most recent voter registration report from California Secretary of State <strong>Alex Padilla</strong>, voters declining to state a party preference make up 24 percent of the state's&nbsp;registered voters. That is nearly a 3-point increase from this time in 2012.</p>

<p>Looking at individual Assembly districts, the percentage of no party preference (independent) voters&nbsp;dips below 20 percent in only a handful of districts, including 12, 21, 23, 26, 31, 32, and 36 (which include Kern, Merced, San Joaquin, San Jose, and Fresno).&nbsp;Five&nbsp;districts even exceed 30 percent, including 17, 19, 25, 49, and 80 (parts of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco).</p>
