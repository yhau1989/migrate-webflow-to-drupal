<p>Not long ago, following serial losses in primary contests across the country, Ohio Governor John Kasich was left for dead in the race for the GOP nomination. But now that Marco Rubio has pulled the plug on his campaign after a devastating loss in Florida to Donald Trump, Kasich has claimed the "establishment lane" for himself with a strong Ohio victory and a clean sweep of its winner-take-all delegates.</p>

And with no chance of winning the nomination outright in the remaining primary contests, he'll need all the home field advantage he can muster to claim the nomination when the RNC convention convenes in Cleveland.</p>
