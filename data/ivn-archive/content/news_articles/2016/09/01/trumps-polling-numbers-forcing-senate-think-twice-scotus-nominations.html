<p>It's now been 169 days since President Obama nominated Chief Judge&nbsp;Merrick Garland to fill Justice&nbsp;Antonin Scalia's vacant seat on the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The waiting game to act on Garland's nomination has become status quo in the headlines. It's just assumed now that action on the nomination&nbsp;will have to wait until after November's election.</p>

<p>But at <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-falters-gop-senators-warm-garland-490544" rel="noopener noreferrer">least some Republican</a> senators&nbsp;are questioning this tactic, realizing what would be at stake if Trump lost his bid for the presidency -- or even worse if the Republicans also lost their control over the Senate.</p>

<p>Senate Judiciary Chairman&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/senate-merrick-garland-confirmation-grassley-227543" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck Grassley</a> hinted this week that hearings could take place during a 'lame duck' session of Congress -- and while this was quickly countered by&nbsp;Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office, even the consideration is showing the angst within the rank-and-file Republicans.</p>

<p>'What if?' is too powerful of a motivator in this high-stakes game of political Russian-roulette, with the worst outcome being a Clinton victory paired with a withdrawal of Garland's nomination by President Obama.</p>

<p>In a field of unlimited uncertainty, Garland has at least some qualities that are appealing to the conservatives.</p>

<p>He's a decade older than the last three justices were at time of appointment. Like it or not, the length of tenure is certainly a factor to consider.</p>

<p>With a lengthy history on the bench and more moderate appeal than Kagan or Sotomayor, a partial victory of confirming a more moderate justice would be a bitter pill to swallow, but it would still be better than being forced to consider a more liberal nominee.</p>

<p>And they also have to consider that many of the 4-4 ties at the Supreme Court have been outright losses -- most recently the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/us/politics/north-carolina-supreme-court-voting-rights-act.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">N. Carolina voting laws</a> being blocked, but also a long stream of tied rulings that will eventually be revisited by the court.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain, as rhetoric heats up on both sides about the Senate's inaction, it will be a tell-tale sign of how the political fortune tellers are reading the signs for the next two months.</p>

<p>Because one side will use this nomination as a political weapon, while the other will use it as damage control -- and it's not totally apparent yet which role each party will be taking.</p>
