<p>Gallup <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Wednesday</a> that more people distrust mass media "to report the news fully, accurately and fairly" now than at any other time in Gallup polling history.&nbsp;According to the polling agency, only 32 percent of poll&nbsp;respondents said they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media.</p>

<p>While trust in the media has been on a consistent downward slope for years, how the media has reported on the 2016 elections is likely the reason for the sharp decline in 2016, dropping&nbsp;8 points from 2015. This would follow historic trends of trust declining significantly in presidential election years.&nbsp;In 2004, for instance, trust fell&nbsp;to 44 percent from 54 percent the previous year. Trust among U.S. adults dropped 4 points in both 2008 and 2012 as well.</p>

<p>The largest drop in 2016 was seen among Republicans. Trust from this demographic plummeted 18 points from 32 percent in 2015 to 14 percent in 2016. Trust dropped 3 points&nbsp;among independents and 4 points among Democrats. According to Gallup, claims by GOP&nbsp;leaders and pundits that Hillary Clinton is receiving overly positive news coverage&nbsp;while downplaying her scandals may be the reason for the huge drop among Republican voters.</p>

<p>Breaking the demographics down by age, trust among respondents 18-49 fell&nbsp;10 points from 36 percent in 2015 to 26 percent in 2016. Trust among adults 50 or older fell 7 points.</p>

<p>Clearly, Americans are not satisfied with how the mass media has covered&nbsp;the elections. Much of the coverage is a two-sided narrative that either focuses on Donald Trump's latest tweet or, lately, Hillary Clinton's bout with&nbsp;pneumonia -- a topic that received nonstop attention from cable news outlets like CNN.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of how the media handles its polls.&nbsp;According to IVN author Rodolfo Cortes Barragan, publicly-available information shows that <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/05/cnn-presidential-polls-used-cpd-shortchange-entire-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN doesn't even poll Millennials</a>. Fox News also drastically <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/02/major-poll-used-cpd-drastically-samples-independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">under-samples independent voters</a> at 17 percent while most polls sample this voting demographic at&nbsp;34-38 percent.</p>

<p>Yet these media outlets take it upon themselves to tell voters who they should vote for and who&nbsp;isn't viable. From nonstop tit-for-tat partisan insults to skewed public opinion polls, is it really any wonder why voters don't trust the mass media to present information fully, accurately, and fairly?</p>
