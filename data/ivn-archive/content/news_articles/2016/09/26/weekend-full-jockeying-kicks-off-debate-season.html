<p>If this weekend's hype over who the presidential candidates are bringing as their front-row guests to the debate is an indication, Monday night's debate will be nothing short of a street-fight of words between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>For most of the primary season and all of the general election season so far, both candidates have had harsh words for the other -- and this is nothing new in American politics. But typically, a strange political detente forms near the debates, where the candidates focus more on issues than the opponent -- hoping to vie for the more rational points with voters.</p>

<p>Not this year, the heat is still on full force with personal attacks and 'stunts' designed solely to embarrass or 'irk' the opponent.</p>

<p>In the front-row guest battle, Hillary Clinton drew first blood by inviting Mark Cuban, a very outspoken Trump critic, to be her front-row guest at the debate.</p>

<p>But Trump seized the opportunity and taunted the Clinton campaign with threats of inviting Gennifer Flowers, a prominent figure in the Clinton scandals of the 1990s, to be his guest on the front row. Though it is reported that the Trump campaign did not invite Flowers.</p>

<p>The bottom line . . . who really cares who sits in the front row?</p>

<p>But this kind of political jockeying is an indication that this first debate is going to be an all out brawl of mudslinging -- and will probably have very little substance or real issues debated by the candidates.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has been built on these kind of tactics, and his supporters seem to eat it up as both entertainment and as a rejection of the 'politics as usual' standards of behavior.</p>

<p>And Trump will almost certainly capitalize on the <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/22/will-lone-wolf-terrorism-sway-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lone-wolf attacks</a> of the past week, trying to advance his agenda for closing our borders.</p>

<p>Clinton, though, is out on pretty thin ice when it comes to this kind of campaigning.</p>

<p>Far too much <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/11/25/want-to-win-as-a-democrat-quit-the-negative-campaigning/" rel="noopener noreferrer">research indicates</a> that engaging in negative campaigning is a losing strategy for Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>But it's the American voters who are the real losers in this year's debate season.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/09/american-sense-fair-play-wants-johnson-debates-catch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">huge percentage of likely voters</a> want to hear the voices of minor-party candidates on the debate stage, especially Gary Johnson. However, he failed to meet the arbitrary polling requirements for the first debate.</p>

<p>Americans want to hear issues and ideas from all sides -- completely evident by the huge support for Johnson's inclusion in the debates, even though the voters may indicate in the same poll that they are voting for a major party candidate.</p>

<p>Voters are hungry for candidates to discuss issues, for <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/05/debate-performance-doesnt-always-transfer-ballot-box/" rel="noopener noreferrer">real debates that actually matter</a>, and for candidates to have answers for today's hot-button issues.</p>

<p>But short of placing shock-collars on the candidates to 'zap' them each time they go off topic, that is simply not going to happen in Monday's debates.</p>

<p>And really, the only 'protest' the voters have is to simply not watch the debates -- which considering how low of viewership the primary debates had this season, that might not be too far off base.</p>

<p>Because at this point, the only 'vote' the viewers have in this process is the power to turn off the mudslinging and 'damage' the network's ratings for contributing to a system that is&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/13/moderator-free-debate-reality-just-argument/" rel="noopener noreferrer">being gamed by the media</a> at every opportunity.</p>

<p>Maybe then we'd get a few debates this year with a meaningful structure, with ideas being shared from all viable sources, and moderators who keep the candidates on subject.</p>

<p>But, perhaps that is far too much to ask in this year's race of the two least-liked candidates in modern history.</p>
