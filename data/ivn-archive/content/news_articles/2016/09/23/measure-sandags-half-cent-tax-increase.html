<p><span>San Diego, CALIF.-</span><span>Measure A is a </span><a href="http://priorities.sandag.org/ballotMeasure" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>proposal from the San Diego Association of Governments</span></a><span> (SANDAG) that would create a half-cent sales tax to fund transportation and infrastructure projects throughout the county.</span></p>

<p><span>The measure would raise about $18 billion over the next 40 years and legally bind SANDAG to finish a number of </span><span>projects&nbsp;</span><span>within the next 15 years.</span></p>

<p><span>Some of those projects include a new Coaster station at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, and the Purple Trolley line from San Ysidro to Kearny Mesa.</span></p>

<p><span>It would also make funds available for a commitment San Diego made to protect endangered species on preserved lands – an agreement it hasn’t figured out how to pay for.</span></p>

<p><span>The tax money would pay for some of the $204 billion worth of projects SANDAG has positioned for its </span><span>regional transportation plan</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Different measures were floated by the agency earlier this year and leveraged</span><span> public transit projects against local infrastructure</span><span>. In July, SANDAG’s board approved a combination of the two to put on the ballot.</span></p>

<p><span>The plan has support from Councilman Todd Gloria, Chula Vista Mayor Mary Salas, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Kevin Faulconer and a coalition of labor and environmentalists oppose it.</span></p>
