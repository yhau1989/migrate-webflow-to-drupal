<p><span><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong>- News from the campus of San Diego State University this week. </span></p>

<p>A new survey was sent to San Diego State University football season ticket holders and other alumni to gauge their interest in a new 40,000-seat stadium located in Mission Valley.</p>

<p>The survey highlighted the very real opportunity San Diego has to transform the valley into park lands and higher education expansion.</p>

<p><span>The tenants proposed in the survey are similar to what’s offered </span><a href="https://ivn.us/2016/09/19/reimagining-mission-valley-heart-measure-d/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>in another measure.</span></a><span> That measure allows for the university expansion, which includes the 40,000-seat football stadium, protects and expands park lands, and sells the existing Qualcomm Stadium site to the highest bidder.</span></p>

<p><span>According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the president of SDSU, </span><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/growth-development/sdut-sdsu-qualcomm-redevelopment-2016apr05-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Elliot Hirshman, endorsed the measure in April.</span></a><span> The article quotes Hirshman as saying the measure would lay the legal groundwork to turn the 166-acre site into an extension of the SDSU campus.</span></p>

<p><span>The same measure would also change the way tourism dollars are allocated, and ensure a more transparent process for voters. But the lasting legacy for the city could lie in its effort to reimagine Mission Valley. It’s that component of the measure that inspired </span><span>long-time San Diego city councilwoman Donna Frye to sign the measure.</span></p>

<p>The park protection plan and higher education uses lie in stark contrast to two other plans making the rounds.</p>

<p>The first of which is County Supervisor Ron Roberts’ plan that was made public in 2015. Roberts and Mayor Kevin Faulconer offered $350 million in taxpayer dollars for a new Mission Valley stadium and redevelopment. That plan was rebuffed by the team who stated they wanted to relocate downtown.</p>

<p><span>The other plan floated for Mission Valley involves <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/relax-mission-valley-can-handle-all-that-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer">City Councilman Scott Sherman.</a> Sherman endorses a massive, multifaceted development, including more hotels and over 6,000 condominiums. It’s an idea that many worry would gridlock traffic in the valley. </span></p>

<p><span>At a recent political gathering,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/21/san-diego-leaders-debate-measures-c-d/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sherman clarified his reason </span></a><span>for the 6,000 condominiums telling the crowd, “I proposed the 6,000 condos to let the public know what it would take to build a stadium with no taxpayer money.” His proposal was scrutinized as environmentally and economically infeasible.</span></p>
