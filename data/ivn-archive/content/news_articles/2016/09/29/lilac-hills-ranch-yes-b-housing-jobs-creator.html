<p>San Diego, CALIF.- As a state, region and community we desperately need more quality jobs and housing options for our growing population. I am proud to say, Lilac Hills Ranch, the development that’s at the heart of the Yes on B campaign, will do those two important things.</p>

<p>Lilac Hills Ranch will create more than a thousand jobs annually for our community. More than half of those jobs will be permanent, the other half will be high-quality construction jobs that could last as many as 10 to 15 years.</p>

<p>This would serve as a critical shot in the arm for our region.</p>

<p>Our lack of housing and quality jobs issues are inextricably linked. With approximately 2,500 member businesses -- representing an estimated 300,000 employees -- the San Diego Regional Chamber is acutely aware of the region’s challenges and what is needed to overcome these issues.</p>

<p>The highlights of the proposed community are hard to ignore:</p>

<p>• Lilac Hills Ranch will create more than a thousand single-family homes.</p>

<p>• 200-Room Group Care Facility</p>

<p>• 50-Room Country Inn</p>

<p>• Farmers Market</p>

<p>• 25 acres of Parks</p>

<p>• 16 miles of Trails (open to the public)</p>

<p>• Recycling Center for use by the general public</p>

<p>• Water Reclamation Plant w/ Recycled Water</p>

<p>As an organization, we fully support the Lilac Hills Ranch development and ask that the voters of San Diego recognize the critical issue before them and vote Yes on B.</p>

<p>Better Housing, Better Jobs, Better Safety, it all adds up to a Better Community which is something that's good for the San Diego region.</p>
