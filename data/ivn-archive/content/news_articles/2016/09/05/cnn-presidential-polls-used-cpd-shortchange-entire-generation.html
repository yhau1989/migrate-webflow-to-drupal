<p>This election season has seen groundbreaking engagement of young people from across the political spectrum. At the moment, many are looking beyond the two establishment parties to Governor <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gary Johnson</strong></a> of the Libertarian Party and Dr. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jill-stein" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jill Stein</strong></a> of the Green Party.</p>

<p>To introduce themselves to a national audience at the debates, Johnson and Stein need to reach a 15% average in a set of polls hand-picked by the Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>

<p>Can the engagement of young people (as well as that of older people) successfully influence enough voters to get the third-party candidates onto the debate stage? It’s possible, but they won’t be getting much help from the CNN poll -- one of the 5 used to calculate the 15% average.</p>

<p>In 2016, every single CNN poll for the general election has failed to adequately sample Americans aged 18-34. While other age groups have their results listed in terms of their % agreement to different questions, the CNN documentation lists “N/A” for those aged 18-34 (i.e., the Millennials).</p>

<p>The reason?</p>

<p>“Some subgroups represent too small a share of the national population to produce crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error.” Groups that are “too small” receive the “N/A.”</p>

<p>Read that again: CNN describes people aged 18-34 as “too small a share of the national population.”</p>

<p>Requests for clarification went unanswered by the CNN Polling Director.</p>

<p>I am left to conclude that the CNN poll either massively under-samples the largest generation in American history or quite simply doesn’t sample them at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-04-at-11.31.11-AM-1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-04 at 11.31.11 AM" height="513" src="cloudinary://Screen-Shot-2016-09-04-at-11.31.11-AM-1.png" width="564"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, contrary to claims made by&nbsp;the <a href="http://debates.org/index.php?page=overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, the CNN polls do not represent the national electorate.</p>

<p>Over the course of the year, this situation has undoubtedly disadvantaged Governor Johnson and Dr. Jill Stein. By under-sampling the younger generation, CNN has robbed third-party candidates of the free media coverage enjoyed by the so-called “major” candidacies of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>Indeed, reporters regularly dispute third-party candidates’ chances in light of the poll numbers. Yet, as an article in Wired magazine claims, “<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/civis-election-polling-clinton-sanders-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the polls are all wrong</a>.”</p>

<p>It’s too late to fix this extraordinary injustice. We must demand that the debate commission open the debates.</p>
