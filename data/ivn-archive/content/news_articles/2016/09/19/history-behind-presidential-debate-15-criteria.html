<p>We over at Third Candidates took a&nbsp;look at the controversial debate access criteria that has been criticized for keeping third party and independent candidates out the important presidential debates.</p>

<p>We spoke&nbsp;with political experts, the authors of this criteria - the Commission on Presidential Debates, and critics who claim that the criteria is intentionally unfair to keep out competitive, non-major party candidates. While&nbsp;Libertarian Party candidate&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gary Johnson</strong></a> and Green<span> Party</span><span> candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jill-stein" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jill Stein</strong></a> polling at historic numbers for third party candidates, they&nbsp;are still being denied entry into the first debate. Needless to say, this rule is as relevant as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Our next episode of Third Candidates will take a look at the hurdles non-major party candidates face when trying to get on state ballots, and a possible reform that's on the ballot in Maine this November that could eliminate the 'spoiler' effect -- Ranked Choice Voting.</p>
