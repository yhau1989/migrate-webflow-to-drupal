<p>For the first time in modern U.S. history, a man who has never held public office, and has no experience in politics may become president. Yet, most voters do not seem to care. In fact, lack of political experience appears to attract voters.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this occurred because most people no longer consider being a “politician” a real profession, although it is one of the oldest and most important jobs in society.</p>

<p>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a politician is “<em>a person experienced in the art or science of government, especially one engaged in conducting the business of a government</em>.”</p>

<p>However, in this election cycle, being a professional “politician” appears to be a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Throughout history, <span>voters</span> despise politicians for their corruptness, dishonesty, and partisanship. Nonetheless, election after election, voters always choose politicians to lead. Donald Trump’s meteoric rise to the Republican nomination demonstrates that voters no longer consider “being a politician” as a requirement, essentially ignoring the fact that politics is a profession, and politicians are professionals.</p>

<p>If voters continue this trend of disregarding experience in politics, the entire profession will soon be discredited and forgotten. Destroying the system may be a reason to vote for Trump, but destroying the system will also destroy the profession.</p>

<p>Donald Trump often claims his businessman experience will make him a successful president, but being “strong with the economy” does not make him a good politician. Politics must be learned through practice. Being a professional is an advantage in every profession. Politics should be no different.</p>

<p>To those who compare Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan: Reagan may have been an actor, but he was also governor of California for 8 years prior to becoming president. Experience used to matter; being a politician used to be a requirement.</p>

<p>Donald Trump succeeded in undermining the entire profession of politics. He demonstrated that spending decades learning the art and science of government is no longer necessary to become president. Donald Trump essentially broke the glass ceiling for non-politicians to hold public office. Indeed, if Donald Trump wins, we all will consider ourselves qualified to be President of the United States.</p>
