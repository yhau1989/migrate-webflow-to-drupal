<p>Former California Governor&nbsp;<strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> announced Friday that he supports Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld appearing in the presidential debates for the same reason he supported nonpartisan elections in California: he believes we need an open political system, not a closed one.</p>



<p>Gov. Schwarzenegger was a major supporter of Proposition 14 in California, which reformed the semi-closed partisan&nbsp;primary&nbsp;system for statewide and federal elections&nbsp;to an open, nonpartisan system. He also <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/06/14/schwarzenegger-asks-south-dakotans-help-terminate-partisanship-passing-amendment-v/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supports Amendment V in South Dakota</a>, which if approved by voters in November would also adopt nonpartisan elections for statewide and federal races.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger joins other major political figures including Mitt Romney, U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, and Mitch Daniels (who is a member of the Commission on Presidential Debates) in calling on the CPD to include Governors Johnson and Weld in the fall debates. The libertarian ticket also has the support of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johnsonweld.com/notable_names_calling_on_the_cpd_to_let_governor_gary_johnson_debate" rel="noopener noreferrer">several major editorial boards nationwide</a>.</p>

<p>Gov. Johnson is currently polling at an average of 10 percent in the 5 national public opinion polls chosen by the CPD to determine debate inclusion. This is 5 points short of what he needs to be included in the debates.&nbsp;However, he is polling over 20 percent in a few states, including Utah and New Mexico, and is over 15 percent in major battleground states like Colorado and the Midwest.</p>

<p>At the moment, it is unclear when the debate commission will decide if they will include a third ticket&nbsp;in the presidential debates. However, with endorsements mounting for their inclusion, the CPD may be pressured to include Johnson and Weld in the presidential debates.</p>
