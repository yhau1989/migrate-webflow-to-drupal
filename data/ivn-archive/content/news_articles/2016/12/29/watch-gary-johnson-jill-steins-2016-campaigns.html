<p>In our fourth episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thirdcandidates" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third Candidates</a>, we follow Gary Johnson and Jill Stein from June to September at various 2016 campaign stops as they try to capitalize on their unique opportunities in a highly unusual election season.</p>

<p>Interviews with Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, their supporters, political leaders, and other activists highlight the goals and emotions that fuel the people who throw themselves against insane odds and a relentless election system.</p>

<p>Both the Green Party and the Libertarians saw growth this election, but what happens next and to what end? Will there ever be room for people outside the major parties who want to participate in our democracy?</p>

<p>Third Candidates is an independently crowdfunded documentary series that took a look at the 2016 election from a non-major party perspective.</p>
