<p>Let’s face it. It’s easy to be a liberal activist these days.</p>

<p>Here are the key steps, which you can follow in any order:</p>
<p>1. Say that all people without money are good,</p>
<p>2. Say that all people with money are bad, and</p>
<p>3. And promise to be a Santa Claus like savior for children of any religion.</p>
<p>Following <a href="/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">six months</a> of Bernie “Damn the 1%” Sanders aggregating popular grievances into the most successful not-really-a-Democrat Democratic nomination campaign in history, it seemed like America was poised to remove the coal from its&nbsp;stockings.</p>

<p>No more dirty Christmases for us!</p>

<p>After all, the lights (solar powered, of course) started to shine on an establishment of, by, and for the evil billionaires that have corrupted all of our institutions -- including our <a href="/tag/primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary elections</a>.</p>

<p>So, after powerful women like Hillary Clinton worked with other powerful women, like <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/25/leaked-dnc-e-mails-suggest-anti-sanders-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debbie Wasserman Schultz&nbsp;and Donna Brazil</a>, to ensure an undemocratic victory for the Democratic Party -- there was a wide open door for a “woman of the people” who didn’t use her&nbsp;gender and race as an excuse to embrace tactics traditionally belonging to the white, male, and privileged class. And, there was a YUGE&nbsp;opportunity to tap into the millennial enthusiasm that powered the 75-year-old Sanders machine.</p>

<p>But she didn’t.</p>

<p>She raised a paltry $3.5 million her entire campaign. And she garnered just over 1% of the national popular vote.</p>

<p>So, for all the fist pounding against the institutions, how was <strong>Jill Stein</strong> able to capture the anti-establishment fervor to advance the “power of the people”?</p>

<p>Not enough to gain <a href="/tag/ballot-access" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballot access</a> to future Green Party candidates in a single state. But, since the election ended, she has been able to raise another <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/12/05/jill-steins-election-recount-effort-raised-7-million-changed-nothing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$7 million</a> to recount the votes in three states that barely rejected the Democratic Party nominee.</p>

<p>And what has that accomplished? Nothing. Except a lot of attention from all the media outlets that <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/11/09/independent-voters-flipped-entire-presidential-election-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrongly predicted</a> the outcome of the 2016 election.</p>

<p>So, for all the Aleppo-induced ostracization of Libertarian candidate <a href="/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gary Johnson</strong></a> from the mainstream political discussion, what did he accomplish?</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Johnson was not a hero of traditional libertarians because, while he refused to embrace liberal economic policies of “give everyone a pizza and a trophy,” he also refused to accept the “give everyone a gun and fight it out” philosophy of the live free or diers.</p>

<p>And, as a former Republican governor, his anti-establishment appeal was in direct competition to the ultimate basher of our institutions - Donald J. Trump.</p>

<p>Yet, Gary Johnson managed to build a massive following. He raised over $12 million from over 225,000 individual donors, and received over 300% more votes than the Green machine.</p>

<p>But most importantly, he put a present in the stockings of libertarians in 39 out of 50 states: automatic ballot access.</p>

<p>That’s nothing to stick your tongue out about.</p>
