<p><span>If you listened to the mainstream media the past two weeks, you would have thought that there was the possibility of an electoral revolt of "faithless electors" who were going to ditch President-elect Donald Trump. But just as all&nbsp;media outlets&nbsp;were wrong about the outcome of the election, they missed the mark once again.</span></p>

<p>Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig said he knew of at least 20 Republican electors who were willing to vote against&nbsp;Trump. But it didn't happen. In fact, Hillary Clinton on Monday, December 19, lost more faithless electors than the president-elect.</p>

<p>In Washington state, for example, only 8 of the 12 electors in the winner-take-all state voted for Clinton. Three electors voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and one cast a vote for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American elder from South Dakota.</p>

<p>Some faithless electors who were required by law to vote for&nbsp;Hillary Clinton were replaced. One elector was replaced in Minnesota while another was replaced in Colorado. The elector in Colorado,&nbsp;Micheal Baca, wanted Republicans to unbind themselves from the popular vote in their state and vote for another Republican.</p>

<p><span>And how many electors did Donald Trump lose?&nbsp;Two total. </span><span>This is the first U.S. presidential election since 1872 with more than one "faithless elector."</span></p>
