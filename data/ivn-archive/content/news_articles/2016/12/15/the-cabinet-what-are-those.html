<p>The President-elect’s Cabinet appointments have dominated&nbsp;the news cycle, which only begs the question: What do these departments and offices actually do?</p>

<p>The Cabinet is included in the Constitution, under Article II, Section 2, where it states:</p>
<blockquote>“The President...may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.”</blockquote>
<p>The Cabinet consists of the heads of departments of government and essentially advise&nbsp;the president on policy and programs. Each executive, given the title "Secretary" (except for the attorney general, who heads the Department of Justice), is appointed by the president, then confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>The vice president is occasionally included in Cabinet talks, as the VP has the opportunity to be the top adviser to the president. Additionally, there&nbsp;are a number of positions outside the typical fifteen Cabinet positions. The positions that require affirmation by the Senate are referred to as “Cabinet-level.” The remaining positions&nbsp;do not have&nbsp;Cabinet-rank, though they&nbsp;still run important government agencies and advise the president. These extra positions will not be included in the below breakdown.</p>

<p>So what are these fifteen positions and departments?</p>
