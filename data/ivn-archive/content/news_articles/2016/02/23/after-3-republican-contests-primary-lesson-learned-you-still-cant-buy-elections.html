<p>With <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong>'s dismal finish in South Carolina comes his long overdue exit from the 2016 Republican primary contest for the presidency.</p>

<p>While this was expected, and possibly even encouraged by the establishment to weed down candidates for Super Tuesday, there is a greater significance to Jeb's departure: you still can't buy elections in the United States.</p>

<p>The <em>Citizens United</em> SCOTUS ruling has been used as a warning -- a warning against plutocrats and the ability of the super-wealthy to outright buy elections.</p>

<p>But the flip side to this is seeing a well-funded, well-connected politician's campaign crash and burn for an inability to connect with the voters.</p>

<p>Jeb's campaign war chest was amazing, outspending most of his opponents many times over -- spending upwards of $53 million in his own campaign and official super PAC. Other analysis&nbsp;has driven this number much higher, with some even estimating over&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/jeb-bush-campaign.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million</a> spent on Jeb's failed campaign.</p>

<p>Even at $53 million, for only three contests leading up to the failure, this represents an obscene amount of money and resources.</p>

<p>If there ever were a political boogeyman seen in <em>Citizens United</em>, spending this much money on trying to sway public opinion would be its calling card. But this boogeyman isn't very scary.</p>

<p>While the better funded campaign wins 91% of the time, according to the <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/think-money-doesnt-matter-in-elections-this-chart-says-youre-wrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a></em>, Jeb's failure to advance is a clear-cut example that money can't buy everything in politics -- especially votes.</p>

<p>The Democrats are not immune to this phenomenon as well. Bernie Sanders has out-fundraised Hillary Clinton by over 3 to 1 so far in 2016, yet Hillary still maintains a small edge in pledged delegates and an enormous lead in superdelegates.</p>

<p>So while we can still hate the principles of the <em>Citizens United</em> ruling, we can take comfort in the reality we are still seeing in America today: money helps in elections, but you still can't outright buy one.</p>
