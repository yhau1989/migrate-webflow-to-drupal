<p>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla on Monday released the first of three voter registration reports ahead of the June 7 primary election. The report shows that not only does the number of registered No Party Preference voters continue to grow, but the title of second largest voting bloc&nbsp;in California will not belong to the Republican Party for much longer.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/upcoming-elections/june-7-2016-presidential-primary-election/154day-presprim-16/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the report</a>, there were 17,259,413 total registered voters as of January 5, 2016 -- an increase of 231,123 from the same point in the 2012 presidential election.&nbsp;According to the secretary of state, this increase is not keeping pace with the growth of eligible voters in the state.</p>

<p>“Only 70.2% of eligible Californians are currently registered,” Padilla said. At <a href="http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-pages/154day-presprim-12/county.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">this point</a> in 2012, 72.01 percent of the electorate was registered to vote.</p>

<p>“If the election were held today, over 7 million otherwise eligible Californians would be left on the sidelines.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is still time to register to vote in the <span><span>June 7</span></span> Presidential Primary Election. Whether you’ve recently turned 18, become a new US citizen, or just want to vote for the first time—I urge Californians to register today,” Padilla added.</p>

<p>Of the total number of registered voters,&nbsp;7,438,655 are registered members of the Democratic Party (up slightly from 2012), but Republicans dropped from&nbsp;5,170,592 to 4,767,259 in the same time period. Meanwhile, voters not registered with any political party went from 3,617,466 to&nbsp;4,141,860.</p>

<p>No Party Preference voters make up 24 percent of the registered voting population while Republicans make up 27.62 percent, a 3-point drop from four years ago. At this rate, NPP voters will well outnumber Republicans by the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>Looking ahead at the June 7 presidential primary, these 4.1 million voters will face limited choices as they are forced to choose between 3 party ballots: Democratic Party, American Independent, or Libertarian Party. The Republican Party continues to deny independents access to its presidential ballot.</p>

<p>California uses a nonpartisan, top-two open primary for statewide and congressional races, meaning all candidates and voters (regardless of party preference) participate on a single ballot and the top two vote-getters move on to the November general election.</p>

<p>However, California&nbsp;still uses a semi-closed system for presidential primaries, meaning private political parties ultimately get to decide whether or not independent&nbsp;voters can participate in the first integral stage of the public election process.</p>
