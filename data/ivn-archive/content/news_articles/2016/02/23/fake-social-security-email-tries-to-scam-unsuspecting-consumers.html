<p><strong><span>CHICAGO</span>, <span>Feb. 22, 2016</span> /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> -- Consumers need to be extra cautious if they receive an email seeming to be from the Social Security Administration. Not only are fraudulent emails with malicious links offering "new features" to monitor finances floating around, but new and fake emails urging consumers to create a <i>My Social Security </i>account are making the rounds. The Social Security Administration has issued an alert on their site to be on the lookout for email phishing and AARP Illinois is helping to warn consumers regarding the new scam.</p>

<p>"Fraudsters are getting craftier as technology advances," said AARP Illinois Communications Manager, <span>Gerardo Cardenas</span>. "The emails they're sending are looking more realistic and the websites they're linking to are near replicas of the real thing. Consumers have to be extremely aware of their tricks and what they need to look out for to protect themselves and their personal information."</p>

<p>The emails circulating appear to be sent directly from the Social Security Administration encouraging consumers to create a <i>My Social Security </i>account—a new online portal that allows for consumers to make requests for new Social Security cards, check the status of their future retirement, disability and survivors benefits, and more. The website linked in the email looks identical to the official site and has the potential to obtain people's social security number and other sensitive personal information.</p>

<p>If you've received an email seeming to be from the SSA be aware that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Most emails from Social Security will come from a ".gov" email address. If the email doesn't end in ".gov," use caution before clicking on any link included or responding to the email.</li>
	<li>Social Security occasionally uses marketing firms to raise awareness of new online services like <i>my Social Security </i>who are allowed to send emails directly to individuals. The links included in these emails should always point to a ".gov" web address.</li>
	<li>To check that a link included is directing to a ".gov" address, hover your mouse over the link until a text box appears with the web address.</li>
	<li>Look for poor choices in wording or spelling.</li>
	<li>Should the email include a business name, telephone number, or web site link, verify them by searching for the official number or website in a search engine.</li>
	<li>If uncertain whether the email came from SSA or any of their marketing firms, <b>do not </b>respond to the email or clink on any links with in the email. Navigate directly to the Social Security website.</li>
	<li>Report the incident immediately by forwarding the fraudulent email to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team at <a href="mailto:phishing-report@us-cert.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer">phishing-report@us-cert.gov</a></li>
