<p>Today, February 2, 2016, a United States Supreme Court justice appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 died at the age of 79, Antonin Scalia.&nbsp;The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/news/press-release/21960" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> that confirmed the recent news where he praised him for his work in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>While it is time to be sympathetic and offer our condolences, support, and prayers, the Supreme Court does not have the luxury of contemplating the loss&nbsp;indefinitely and must go on as seamless as possible. It simply cannot function with one of its&nbsp;members missing.</p>

<p>The reason there are 9 justices on&nbsp;the Supreme Court is because there can never be a tie. A real test for civility in the process is yet to come while campaigns for primary elections are in full force and a presidential election is underway.</p>

<p>There is&nbsp;relatively good news for both Democrats and Republicans, which might translate into bad news for the rest of us. The good news for&nbsp;Democrats is that the acting President of the United States gets to appoint the next justice, while the good news for Republicans is that the Senate&nbsp;gets to confirm&nbsp;the president's nomination. With a Democrat in the Oval Office&nbsp;and a Republican majority in the Senate, we might see the most gruesome battle yet.</p>

<p>The confirmation process will take center stage as the nation and the world will watch with meticulous focus, as many have come to realize the importance of the Supreme Court&nbsp;throughout the ages. Voters, citizens, residents, those living within our borders, and the rest of the world have seen the potential of a metamorphosis, where the United States takes wide turns at all sides of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Rightfully so and regardless of where one stands politically, the country will need to respectfully mourn Justice Scalia's death because one of us has died, a very important person that was part of an important institution&nbsp;of our government. Without a doubt, his interpretation of the law was&nbsp;more than a mere opinion. It was 11.11 percent of what we would potentially hold as the standard as a country.</p>

<p>One of the greatest events in history and civics of the United States of America is about to start, with consequences and&nbsp;repercussion for years to come.</p>
