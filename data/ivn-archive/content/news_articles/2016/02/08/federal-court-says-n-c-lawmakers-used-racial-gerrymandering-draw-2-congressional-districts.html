<p>A panel of federal judges ruled Friday that North Carolina&nbsp;lawmakers used racial gerrymandering to draw at least two of the state's thirteen congressional districts. According to The News &amp;&nbsp;Observer,&nbsp;the order from the three judges bars elections in the 1st and 12th congressional districts, leaving many to wonder about the March primary.</p>

<p>From The News &amp; Observer:</p>
<blockquote>"The lawsuit decided on Friday is one of several challenging the maps in federal and state court.

&nbsp;

Friday’s ruling was strongly worded in discounting the legislature’s claims that race played no part in drawing the new maps, saying the redistricting had fundamentally affected citizens’ rights to vote.

&nbsp;

“The record is replete with statements indicating that race was the legislature’s paramount concern,” the ruling says."</blockquote>
<p>The court has given the state legislature <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=79650" rel="noopener noreferrer">two weeks</a> to redraw the two districts, which some political analysts say&nbsp;will require the tweaking of surrounding districts as well.</p>

<p>State lawmakers are finalizing an appeal, which will likely be filed with the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. Additionally, lawmakers are asking the high court to issue a stay on the lower court's ruling.</p>
