<p>The "money bomb," a&nbsp;term that took on new meaning during&nbsp;Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign when he raised over $4.2 million in 24 hours (Paul's biggest money bomb ended up being $6 million), is a short, online-driven political fundraising push&nbsp;that centers around a specific event or date.&nbsp;It has become a crucial component of <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong>' presidential campaign arsenal.</p>

<p>A Sanders campaign spokesman <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-52-million-new-hampshire-win-results-hillary-2016-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> Wednesday that in the hours following the New Hampshire primary (18 hours to be precise), Bernie raked in $5.2 million in small donations. (According to the campaign, the average contribution was $34.) This is the second major money bomb in a week as the campaign reported that Bernie Sanders raised <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/02/03/bernie-sanders-sets-personal-fundraising-record-hours-following-iowa-caucus-aides-say/TNHZhVgM5l9vMRRpELlnKK/story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million</a> between Iowa Caucus night and the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>On the evening of primary election day Tuesday, the Sanders team converted his website into a New Hampshire-themed fundraising page in anticipation of a huge night for the senator from Vermont. It was Bernie Sanders, though, who&nbsp;dropped the money bomb during his victory speech&nbsp;after beating Hillary Clinton by over 20-points.</p>

<p>“I’m going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America,” Sanders said. “My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute. Please help us raise the funds we need, whether it’s $10 bucks, $20 bucks, or $50 bucks. Help up us raise the money we need to take the fight to Nevada, South Carolina, and the states on Super Tuesday.”</p>

<p>The campaign webpage peaked at 51,000 concurrent visitors at one point during the speech, which according to the campaign beat the 18,000 record set on Iowa caucus night. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are set to debate Thursday night, in which Sanders will likely use his continued success with small donors to make the case that he is the candidate for&nbsp;the common voter.</p>
