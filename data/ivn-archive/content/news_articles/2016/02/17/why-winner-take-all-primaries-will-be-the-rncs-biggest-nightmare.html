<p>Three establishment candidates remain standing in the GOP race — Kasich, Rubio, and Bush. <strong>Reince Priebus</strong> needs two of them to drop out soon, or he and the other GOP establishment pooh-bahs may be faced with <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> winning the GOP nomination with just 30-something percent support of voting Republicans.</p>

<p>How is this possible? The RNC has engineered the primary process to be dominated by winner-take-all contests, presumably to avoid brokered conventions. While the early contests are proportional (with thresholds) in their awarding of delegates, South Carolina is winner-take-all, and starting March 15 (Super Tuesday), virtually all remaining contests are winner-take-all. In all, winner-take-all states add up to well over 900 delegates, well over two-thirds of the 1,237 magic number to win the nomination.</p>

<p>Now, combine the structure of the contests with the fractured-but-persistent establishment slate. Chris Christie has dropped out of that bunch, but his billionaire donor, Kenneth Langone, is now backing <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/john-kasich" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Kasich</a></strong>, shoring up the Ohio governor’s chances to stay in the race for a while (Kasich’s home state of Ohio is winner-take-all on March 15). Kasich’s persistence was also energized by his second place finish in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Likewise, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong> is not going anywhere even if it&nbsp;remains true that he’s not going anywhere -- he did just well enough in New Hampshire to quell the “give it up” whispers and he has the super PAC money to go the distance. Finally, despite a rough New Hampshire, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/marco-rubio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco Rubio</a></strong> is still the RNC’s highest-odds establishment hope.</p>

<p>Kasich, Bush, and Rubio may well be splitting the establishment vote until March 15. The current math says they are splitting 41.9%, as Trump, Cruz, and Carson—non-establishment—are polling at a total of 58.1% (<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics average</a>). Trump’s current 31.7% polling average will get some oxygen assuming Ben Carson (6.7%) drops out. With that, a mid- to high-30s average performance by Trump positions him nicely for the winner-take-all contests&nbsp;versus a three-person split of the 42% establishment support that Bush, Rubio, and Kasich (or even a two-person split between two of these candidates) may face.</p>

<p>The alternative to so many winner-take-all contests&nbsp;might be proportional contests all the way to June. That would have virtually guaranteed a brokered convention, but one might guess that the RNC would take that over the Trump (or Cruz?) nomination coming out of a very fractured and persistent field.</p>
