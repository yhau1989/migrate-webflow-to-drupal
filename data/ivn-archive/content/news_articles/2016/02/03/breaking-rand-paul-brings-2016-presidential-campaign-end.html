<p>Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul announced&nbsp;Wednesday morning that he is suspending his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Paul released a statement saying that he intends to end his campaign where he began,“ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty.”</p>
<blockquote>It’s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House. Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty.&nbsp;Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy. Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I.</blockquote>
<p>Paul’s announcement follows the Iowa caucus on Monday, where he came in fifth place behind GOP contenders Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson.</p>

<p>In his statement, Paul said although he is suspending his campaign, “the fight is far from over,” and he will focus his efforts on his work as a senator.</p>
<blockquote>Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over. I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term. - U.S. Senator Rand Paul</blockquote>
