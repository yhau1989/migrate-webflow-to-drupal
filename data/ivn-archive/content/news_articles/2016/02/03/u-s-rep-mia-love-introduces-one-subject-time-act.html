<p><strong><span>AKRON, Ohio</span>, <span>Feb. 3, 2016</span> /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> -- "It's been a long time since Congress needed a majority to pass a law," says Jim Babka, President of DownsizeDC.org, Inc. "But that could change, thanks to Representative <span>Mia Love</span> of <span>Utah</span>. She has introduced our <a href="https://secure.downsizedc.org/etp/one-subject/" rel="noopener noreferrer">'One Subject at a Time Act' (OSTA)</a> in the House (HR 4335)."</p>

[gravityform id="106" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]"OSTA requires each bill Congress passes to be about one subject only," Babka explains. "This would end the practice of clustering unrelated measures into one package. Congressional leaders have long used this trick to pass unpopular laws on the strength of the popular proposals with which they're unnaturally joined. OSTA would end this fraud forever."

<p>"Every bill would have to stand or fall on its own merits," declares Babka.</p>

<p>"Multi-subject bills are an old bipartisan problem. DownsizeDC.org created OSTA in response to numerous omnibus bills passed when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress. For instance, the massively unpopular Real ID Act was only passed because the Republican leadership included it in an Emergency Troop Appropriation bill. That bill also included tsunami relief! The ban on Internet poker was included in a Port Security bill," says Babka.</p>

<p>Babka commends Representative Love for both introducing OSTA, and finding 11 co-sponsors for it. "Downsize DC will be working to find more co-sponsors. OSTA has already been introduced in the Senate by Senator <span>Rand Paul</span> (S. 1572)."</p>
