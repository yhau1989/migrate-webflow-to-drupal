<p>The Denver Post <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28700919/colorado-republicans-cancel-2016-presidential-caucus-vote" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported in August</a> that the&nbsp;Republican Party of Colorado canceled its presidential caucus&nbsp;after the RNC approved a rule change that could negatively impact the state's influence in the most open GOP primary contest in modern U.S. history.</p>

<p>From The Denver Post:</p>
<blockquote>The GOP executive committee has voted to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll after the national party <a href="http://frontloading.blogspot.com/2013/01/thoughts-on-where-2016-presidential.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="FrontloadingHQ Elections blog">changed its rules</a> to require a state's delegates to support the candidate that wins the caucus vote.

&nbsp;

The move makes Colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process, according to political experts, but other caucus states are still considering how to adapt to the new rule.</blockquote>
