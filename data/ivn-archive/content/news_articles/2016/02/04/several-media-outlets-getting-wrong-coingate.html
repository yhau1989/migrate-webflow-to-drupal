The results of the Iowa Caucus on Monday night were the closest in the state’s Democratic Caucus history, with </span><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-battle-down-to-the-wire-in-iowa-1454358252" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Hillary Clinton beating Bernie Sanders by .3%</span></a><span>. Reports flooded the Internet claiming that this “virtual tie” came down to seven separate coin flips, six of which were won by Clinton.

<p><span>Social networks like Facebook and Twitter can be powerful tools for those who </span><a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.ca/r/social-media/how-to-master-twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>know how to use them</span></a><span>, but can also spread confusion. It remains important to check reliable sources on misreported stories to prevent spreading incorrect information.</span></p>
