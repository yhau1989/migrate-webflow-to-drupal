<p>Colorado State Representative&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Neville</strong> (R-Castle Rock) has introduced a bill that would allow teachers and faculty in the state who possess a concealed carry license to carry firearms in school.</p>

<p>Neville is a Columbine High School graduate who&nbsp;survived the infamous 1999 mass shooting, which USA Today <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/02/24/columbine-survivor-pushes-for-guns-in-schools-colorado/80876462/" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> left 13 dead and 20 injured.</p>

<p>“<em>The only thing that is going to stop murderers intent on doing harm is to give good people the legal authority to carry a gun to protect themselves and our children</em>,” <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/270420-columbine-survivor-calls-for-guns-in-schools" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;Rep. Neville according to The Hill.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The only thing that is going to stop murderers intent on doing harm is to give good people the legal authority to carry a gun to protect themselves and our children." author="Colorado State Rep. Patrick Neville"]

<p>“<em>Parents wake up everyday and bring their children to school on blind faith that their kids will return home safe. Unfortunately, the current system continues to leave our children as sitting targets for criminals intent on doing harm</em>,” he said.</p>

<p>Neville introduced a similar bill last year, which&nbsp;was defeated in Colorado’s Democrat-led House of Representatives. Under current state law, teachers are banned from carrying concealed weapons on school grounds.</p>

<p>When advocating for last year’s iteration of the bill, he <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/231445-columbine-lawmaker-pushing-for-guns-in-schools" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “<em>Our teachers and faculty [at Columbine] were heroic in so many ways that day.&nbsp;That’s why I truly believe had some of them had the legal authority to be armed, more of my friends would still be alive today.</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>As was the case in 1999, criminals aren’t deterred by a flashy sign on the door</em>,” added Neville.</p>

<p>Obtaining a concealed carry permit in Colorado <a href="http://www.usacarry.com/colorado_concealed_carry_permit_information.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">requires</a> submitting to an FBI/CBI background check and providing proof of the completion of a firearms training course. Individuals&nbsp;who are addicted to drugs or alcohol or&nbsp;named in a civil or criminal restraining order are prohibited from&nbsp;carrying.</p>
