<p>NPR recently reported nationally on an interview between public radio reporter&nbsp;Jude Joffe-Block and campaign directors of&nbsp;two nonpartisan organizations on the state of elections in Arizona. Joffe-Block spoke with <strong>Patrick McWhorter</strong> of <a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Primaries</a> and <strong>Timothy Castro</strong> of Independents for Arizona, who argue that independent voters are not being treated fairly.</p>

<p>“Independent voters, now 37 percent of all Arizona registered voters, are treated like second-class citizens,” argued&nbsp;McWhorter.</p>

<p>Arizona conducts a closed primary for its presidential elections, which means that participation is conditioned on being a registered member of&nbsp;a political party. Voters who do not register with a party at least 29 days before election day are not allowed to vote for which primary candidate they prefer.</p>

<p>In other words, over a million voters in Arizona are&nbsp;denied access to the first stage of the presidential election process.</p>

<p>Castro argued that such exclusion from a presidential primary was&nbsp;simply unfair and implied that this type of&nbsp;voting system was&nbsp;not American.</p>

<p>The legislature is <a href="http://knau.org/post/az-lawmakers-want-stop-funding-presidential-primaries#stream/0" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently considering a bill</a> that would make&nbsp;political parties pay for presidential primaries instead of taxpayers. It is estimated that presidential preference elections (primaries) cost about $10 million and the legislature cut $6 million from the primary election fund in 2015.</p>

<p>Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan has voiced her support for <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/ariz-sec-state-calls-end-taxpayer-funded-presidential-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ending taxpayer-funded primaries</a> for private political parties.</p>
