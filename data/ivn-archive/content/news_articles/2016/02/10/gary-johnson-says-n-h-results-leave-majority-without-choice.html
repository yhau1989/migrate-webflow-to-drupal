<p>The Tumblr blog, Gary Johnson News, posted Libertarian presidential candidate <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a></strong>'s <a href="http://garyjohnsonnews.tumblr.com/post/139024123032/gov-gary-johnson-nh-results-leave-a-majority" rel="noopener noreferrer">response to the New Hampshire primary results</a> Tuesday night. Johnson's statement is as follows:</p>

<p>“New Hampshire’s results proved once again that the so-called major party nominating process produces candidates who are on the edges of the political and policy spectrum, leaving the majority of Americans without a choice they can feel good about.</p>

<p>“I remain convinced that the real majority in America are fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. They want a government that does less and costs less, and allows individuals to run their own lives, businesses and families.</p>

<p>“If voters are looking to the winners of the New Hampshire primary for a candidate who reflects those beliefs, they are going to be disappointed.</p>

<p>“2016 is shaping up to be the year when the real ‘mainstream’ candidate won’t be found in either the Republican or Democratic nominees.”</p>
