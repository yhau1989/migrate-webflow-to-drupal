[gravityform id="47" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]Following presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s first-place finish in the New Hampshire Democratic Primary on Tuesday, rival Hillary Clinton, who finished&nbsp;a distant second, is set to gain the same amount of delegates in the state.

<p>Sanders, who won the state’s primary with&nbsp;151,584 votes over Clinton’s&nbsp;95,252 votes, gained&nbsp;13 delegates and The Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/268935-clinton-likely-to-leave-nh-with-same-number-of-delegates" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Sanders is&nbsp;expected to officially receive 15 when the total results are in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/states/nh/Dem" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/politics/clinton-still-leads-where-it-matters-in-delegates-191613121.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Politics</a> reported that Sanders and Clinton each currently have 15 delegates&nbsp;in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;Clinton won 9 delegates, Clinton also reportedly has the support of 6 superdelegates.</p>

<p><em>“New Hampshire has 8 superdelegates, 6 of which are committed to Hillary Clinton, giving her a total of 15 delegates from New Hampshire as of Wednesday at 9 a.m.,”</em>&nbsp;the Daily Caller&nbsp;<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/10/hillary-earns-more-new-hampshire-delegates-than-sanders-after-loss/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported.</a></p>

<p>The Hill reported that<em>“superdelegate&nbsp;support is fluid, though, so some of those delegates now backing Clinton could switch to Sanders”</em> ahead of&nbsp;the Democratic National Convention,&nbsp;<em>“but as it stands, the superdelegate support gives Clinton a total of 15 New Hampshire delegates.”</em></p>

<p>CNN’s most recent estimate <a href="http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/parties/democrat" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a> that Clinton has 431 delegates total and Sanders has 52 delegates. An estimate from the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ff373be08d644e4d97df4955bdbd5fe0/latest-clinton-his-ground-early-nh-primary-day" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>&nbsp;has provided different numbers, claiming that&nbsp;Clinton has 394 delegates and Sanders has 42.</p>
