<p>Earlier tonight, I was saying to my wife, La Verle, the biggest loser in the presidential race is the national media.</p>

<p>Brian Williams was just saying on MSNBC, "The biggest loser is national punditry."</p>

<p>That too, Brian.</p>

<p>When you media folks try to figure it all out on the political side, you might want to try and figure out what went wrong with your profession.</p>

<p>I think what this proves is the national media is just as out of touch, just as disconnected, as the Washington politicians.</p>

<p>And, as always, I am reminded of what the late Senator Eugene McCarthy said about the press, "They are like blackbirds sitting on a telephone wire. One flies away, they all fly away."</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>
