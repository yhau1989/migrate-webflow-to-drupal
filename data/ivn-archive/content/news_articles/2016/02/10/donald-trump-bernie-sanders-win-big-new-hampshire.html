<p>Not long after polls closed in New Hampshire Tuesday night, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> and U.S. Senator <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong> were declared the winners of their respective primary contests. As of the publication of this article, Sanders secured 59% of the Democratic primary vote while Trump won a commanding victory with 34%.</p>
<p>Looking at New Hampshire&nbsp;polls, the results aren't a huge surprise. The last polls leading up to primary day showed Sanders with a <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">double-digit lead</a> over Clinton. Trump has <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-3350.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">dominated the Republican field</a> in New Hampshire and in nationwide polls since the summer. Yet, the role that independent voters played in these victories cannot be understated.</p>
<p>New Hampshire carries substantial weight in determining how the presidential race proceeds; candidates who do well can expect to benefit from favorable media coverage and a bump in campaign donations, whereas candidates who perform poorly may face increased pressure to drop out.&nbsp;It is worth noting, however, that the last three candidates elected to the presidency – Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama – all finished second in the New Hampshire primary.</p>
<p>The state utilizes a semi-closed primary system. This means voters must affiliate with either the Republican or Democratic party&nbsp;to participate. They can change their registration on primary election day and subsequently change back after casting their ballot.&nbsp;With historic turnout, it is clear that independent voters, who make up 44% of the state's electorate, had a major impact in Tuesday night's results.</p>
<p>Trump and Sanders have their own appeal, but when both made their acceptance speeches on Tuesday night, they made it clear that they were not for business-as-usual in Washington. They want to see change, and this message is clearly resonating with an electorate that increasingly chooses not to identify with either major party.</p>

<p>The next presidential contest for both parties will take place on February 20. For Democrats, it will be held in Nevada. For Republicans, South Carolina. Nevada uses a closed caucus system and South Carolina uses an open partisan primary system.</p>
