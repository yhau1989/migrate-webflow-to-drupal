<p>The Democratic primary race appeared to be incredibly close during the Iowa caucus Monday night, where candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly won at least six precincts by way of a coin toss.</p>

<p>While the caucus numbers led former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to drop out of the race, it left Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a virtual tie in several precincts.</p>

<p>Some precincts solved the tie by flipping a coin and various reports show that in at least six different cases, Clinton was declared the winner of the precinct based off of the coin toss.</p>

<p>One of these coin tosses occurred at a precinct in Ames. David Schweingruber, an associate professor of sociology at Iowa State University and a Sanders supporter,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/02/02/sometimes-iowa-democrats-award-caucus-delegates-coin-flip/79680342/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the Des Moines Register that after&nbsp;484 eligible caucus attendees were recorded, only 424 participants were counted when they were split up by candidate, <em>“leaving 60 apparently missing.”</em></p>

<p><em>“When those numbers were plugged into the formula that determines delegate allocations, Clinton received four delegates and Sanders received three — leaving one delegate unassigned,”</em>&nbsp;Schweingruber said.</p>

<p>Because of the missing numbers,&nbsp;Schweingruber said the Sanders campaign challenged the results, and the Democratic Party officials they reached out to on a hotline recommended they settle the dispute with a&nbsp;coin toss.</p>

<p>Fernando Peinado, a political reporter at Univision, <a href="https://twitter.com/FernandoPeinado/status/694345745420320768" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>&nbsp;on Twitter that a precinct in Des Moines was also given to Clinton after being determined by a coin toss.</p>
