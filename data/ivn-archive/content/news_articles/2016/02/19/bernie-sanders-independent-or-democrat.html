<p>Independent U.S. Senator&nbsp;Bernie Sanders, who is running in the Democratic presidential primary, openly expressed his disapproval of the two-party system on Thursday during an <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/269967-sanders-two-party-system-holds-back-competition" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSNBC candidate forum</a>. Sanders has described himself as a democratic socialist and argues that it is “wrong” how America’s current system diminishes competition to just two sides.</p>

<p>"I chose to run proudly in the Democratic primary and caucus and look forward to winning that process. But clearly, as a nation, I think we flourish when there are different ideas out there," he said.</p>
<blockquote>"Sometimes the two-party system makes it very, very difficult to get on the ballot if you are a third party, and I think that's wrong. I think we should welcome competition." - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)</blockquote>
<p>Since he announced his candidacy, Sanders has maintained that his decision to <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/12/22/is-bernie-sanders-in-a-codependent-relationship-with-democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer">run as a Democrat</a> as opposed to running as an independent is because he does not want to be responsible for a Republican win by splitting votes in the general election.</p>
