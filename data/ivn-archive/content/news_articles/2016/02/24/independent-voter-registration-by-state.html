<p>Independent voters are the fastest growing voting demographic in the United States. As of the latest registration reports, there are approximately 28 million independent voters registered nationwide. The chart below includes the most recent available data for each state as of&nbsp;mid-January 2016.</p>

<p>Please note that some secretary of state offices do not regularly update this information and not every state offers the option of declaring party preference upon registration. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the exact number of independent voters in those states.</p>
