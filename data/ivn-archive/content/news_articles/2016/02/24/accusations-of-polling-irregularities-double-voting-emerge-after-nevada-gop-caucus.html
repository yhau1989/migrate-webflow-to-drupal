<p>GOP officials are reportedly looking into accusations of voting irregularities including ballot shortages and double voting, after reports of a chaotic scene unfolded during Tuesday’s Nevada Caucus.</p>

<p>RNC spokesman Fred Brown <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/23/nevada-caucuses-double-voting-reports-las-vegas-si/" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged</a>&nbsp;that there were reports of <em>“long lines and not enough ballots at Palo Verde High School”</em> Tuesday night, which resulted in some voters being <em>“turned away and directed to another location.”</em></p>

<p>In response to reports of double-voting, political reporter and commentator Jon Ralston&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RalstonReports/status/702324704703434753" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that one GOP official said the party takes <em>“reports of double voting very seriously and we will be reviewing ballots.”</em></p>
<blockquote>"Obviously we take reports of double voting very seriously and we will be reviewing ballots. There is a master sign in and that we will be checking closely as well. In terms of running out of ballots, we were prepared for that, and more were on site in a matter or minutes. Other thing to know is because you have multiple precincts in one spot, not the entire place was in chaos, just a select few that were rushed, which contained the problems."</blockquote>
<p>Business mogul <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> was declared the <a href="http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president" rel="noopener noreferrer">winner</a> of the Nevada Caucus, taking 45.9% of the vote.</p>

<p>In a rally prior to the caucus, Trump <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/02/donald-trump-lawyer-ted-cruz-nevada-219681?lo=ap_c1" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> voters to watch out for Texas Sen. <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/ted-cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a>, claiming that he is the <em>“single biggest liar”</em> Trump has ever known.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Watch out for dishonest stuff because I’ll tell you what, a lot of dishonesty with this." author="Donald Trump"]

<p><em>“Watch out for dishonest stuff because I’ll tell you what, a lot of dishonesty with this,”</em>Trump said. <em>“You just gotta be careful. They have paper ballots. They have the whole deal going. So just watch out.”</em></p>

<p>Trump claimed Cruz is&nbsp;<em>“the best I’ve ever seen”</em> when it comes to lying, and then added,&nbsp;<em>“Of course, really, the great liars are the ones that don’t get caught, right?”</em></p>

<p>However, many of the polling irregularities that were reported Tuesday night were in connection with Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Twitter user Josh Jordan <a href="https://twitter.com/NumbersMuncher/status/702321355430072320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a series of pictures of caucus-goers in Trump gear, claiming that ballots were <em>“being tucked under envelopes,”</em> and voters were <em>“not being checked for ID.”</em></p>

<p>National Review reporter Elaina Plott <a href="https://twitter.com/elainaplott/status/702323423901458432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on Twitter that one Nevada precinct&nbsp;did not have its site set up, while another precinct had “<em>40-50 loose ballots on the table”</em> that were put under envelopes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/12/state-laws-polling-place-electioneering-102912.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a> the National Association of Secretaries of State, in the state of Nevada, electioneering activities including<em> “wearing or displaying any badge, button or other insigne which is designed or tends to aid or promote the success or defeat of any political party or a candidate or ballot question to be voted upon at that election,</em>” is prohibited.</p>

<p>In response to the accusations, the Nevada GOP <a href="https://twitter.com/NVGOP/status/702336487317069826" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>,<em> “It’s not against the rules for volunteers to wear candidate gear.”</em></p>
