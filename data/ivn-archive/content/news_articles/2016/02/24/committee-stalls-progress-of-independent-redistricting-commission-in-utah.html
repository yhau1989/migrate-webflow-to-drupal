<p>The Salt Lake Tribune reported Tuesday that legislation to create an independent redistricting commission in Utah stalled in committee. The proposed 9-member commission was recommended for study over the summer.</p>

<p>HB313 was introduced by Rep. Rebecca Chavez-Houck (D-Salt Lake City) in an effort to restore public trust and confidence in the redistricting process and elections.&nbsp;Supporters of the bill include the League of Women Voters and <a href="http://www.representmeutah.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Represent Me Utah</a>, a nonprofit organization that pushes for ways to increase citizen involvement in&nbsp;local, state, and federal levels of government.</p>

<p>The Tribune reports:</p>
<blockquote>Chavez-Houck's proposal calls for a nine-person commission with three judges, two voters registered as independents, plus two Republicans and two Democrats appointed by legislative leaders. It would hold hearings around the state.

&nbsp;

Chavez-Houck said it would be advisory only, and legislators would retain final power to draw boundaries. She noted that Salt Lake County used a similar commission to draw its boundaries for the county council — and closely followed its recommendations.</blockquote>
<p>So unlike states like California and Arizona -- whose independent redistricting commission was <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/06/29/scotus-ultimate-political-power-resides-people/" rel="noopener noreferrer">upheld by the Supreme Court</a> in 2015 -- the proposed commission would not actually take part in the drawing of the districts. According to a July report from UtahPolicy.com, <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/07/30/report-65-utah-voters-want-independent-redistricting-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">65 percent of Utahns</a> believed an independent redistricting commission should redraw electoral districts after the Census, not legislators.</p>
