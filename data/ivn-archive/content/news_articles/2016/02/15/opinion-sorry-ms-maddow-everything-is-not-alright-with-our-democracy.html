<p>Rachel Maddow said Friday night that Bernie Sanders' campaign may be in trouble because it is based upon voter turnout -- that in Iowa and New Hampshire the number of Democrats voting in this year's caucus and primary was down from 2008.</p>

<p>That's true, it's a fact and hence, no quarrel.</p>

<p>What upsets me is Dr. Maddow's failure, total failure, to point out that in Iowa the percentage of registered Democrats voting in their state's caucus was a mere 15.8; that Republicans hardly did better, with 16.7.</p>

<p>New Hampshire did markedly better, with more than 50 percent turnout, but still 295,791 registered voters did not vote Tuesday in the Granite State.</p>

<p>And yet, Dr. Maddow gushed election night that this was democracy in action.</p>

<p>As I wrote earlier, <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/02/11/way-run-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer">our democracy has become a sham</a>.</p>

<p>What I want from Rachel Maddow and her colleagues at MSNBC -- indeed, from all media -- is some acknowledgement of the shameful state of American democracy, but none has been forthcoming.</p>

<p>The why of it is this:</p>

<p>Political campaigns are big money makers for television; they raise ratings and money, lots of money, so why put a negative face on it?</p>

<p>So they don't, especially a cheerleader like Ms. Maddow.</p>

<p>Just so we're clear, I am not normally a critic of Ms. Maddow. I think she more than any other person focused the nation's attention on Flint, and for that she deserves great credit.</p>

<p>But she needs to stop gushing about the state of our democracy and start telling the truth, which is – a whole lot of folks ain’t voting.</p>
