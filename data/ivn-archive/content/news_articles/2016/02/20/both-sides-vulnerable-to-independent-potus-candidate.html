<p><a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2324" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quinnipiac University</a> has released its newest presidential polling data, with some surprising analysis for those considering an independent run at the White House for 2016.</p>

<p>While this is the first major poll showing Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) beating all of the Republican field in the general election, the most important thing this poll showed is that an independent run at the POTUS would hurt both party's chances--but the Democratic candidate worse.</p>

<p>In the past, independent candidates were&nbsp;seen as a <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/25/5-common-campaign-strategies-major-parties-use-independent-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoiler</a> to one side or the other. All too often major party candidates tell voters that 'a vote for the independent is a vote for the opponent,' and often this analogy is true--the independent siphons votes from one side significantly worse than the other (i.e. Ross Perot's two presidential&nbsp;campaigns).</p>

<p>In modern elections, during the primary season, the candidate has to consolidate the base by rallying to the core principles of the ilk. Then, in the general election, there is a standard gesture to the center, trying to win over independents, swing-voters, and the valuable political center. It is impossible for either candidate to win without the non-aligned and political center.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has grown in recent cycles, and what this poll is suggesting is that a strong independent candidate who appeals to the center and non-aligned voters will both capture it and siphon votes from both sides of the political partisan divide.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Without a question, Bernie Sanders is a&nbsp;self-proclaimed&nbsp;extreme of the political left. Likewise, the major Republican contenders, with the possible exception of Kasich, represent different aspects of the extreme political right--social, economic, or political. Gestures to the center by either side will be extremely difficult, and will most likely be wholly determined by the vice-president tap on both sides.</p>

<p>Where President Obama had a party darling as a political partner in Joe Biden to consolidate his party weaknesses, 2016 will be determined by both sides appealing to (or possibly even appalling) the center with their VP choice.</p>

<p>But if a candidate started in the political divide, like a moderate such as Michael Bloomberg could, then neither side would easily capture those votes and would lose a certain number of party members who are tired of the party antics and partisanship.</p>

<p>This poll should also serve as a warning to the parties about the modern primary system. A moderate can win the general election, but can't currently win a primary in either party. What this has created is a climate where a moderate independent could completely circumvent the party primaries, avoid the political 'battering,' and still come out viable in the general election.</p>

<p>The parties have created this opportunity, it's now time for the independents to capitalize on it.</p>
