headline: 6 Political Axioms that Could Help Us Predict the Winner of the 2016 Election

<p>With only a few short days left in this presidential election cycle, it's always interesting to look at the political axioms, however odd or strange, to see how each candidate is doing.</p>

<p>While these axioms are not by any means determinants of the election, some have political insight -- while others are absurdly fun to consider.</p>
<h3>1. High Prices at the Pump Hurt the Incumbent Party</h3>
<p>This is more of a new political axiom, for decades the prices of oil and gasoline held steady or at least paced with overall inflation.</p>

<p>The gasoline spikes of the 1990s, followed by the overwhelming gasoline prices in 2008 definitely set up a pattern -- the incumbent party is blamed when voters' wallets hurt at the pump.</p>

<p>Gas prices have been lower throughout 2016, with the <a href="http://gasprices.aaa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">national price hovering</a> at $2.21 per gallon.</p>

<p>Many realities in geopolitics have supported this, with many countries still in a 'pump at any price' mentality to boost cash reserves.</p>

<p>While the days of decades long $1.00 per gallon gasoline are far gone, the current price is definitely not a serious cause for anyone to blame the incumbents for expensive gas.</p>
<h3>2. Incumbents Can't Win Without a 60% Approval Rating of the POTUS</h3>
<p>President Obama's approval rating has held steady in the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-50's for months</a>, but can't seem to get past the 60% hurdle.</p>

<p>Sure, Congress still has an abysmal approval rating,&nbsp;not breaking <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/196268/ahead-elections-congress-approval.aspx?g_source=Politics&amp;g_medium=newsfeed&amp;g_campaign=tiles" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 percent for three-straight years</a> -- but will&nbsp;this affect what has otherwise been a 'perfect' axiom of presidential predictors?</p>

<p>Disaffection with Congress may flip at least one chamber, but who knows what will happen with President Obama's split approval.</p>
<h3>3. Unpopular Wars and Lack of Strategy Damages Incumbents</h3>
<p>Since the Korean War, unpopular and 'unwinnable' wars have damaged incumbents.</p>

<p>President Eisenhower's single greatest statement of his 1952 campaign was that he would 'go to Korea,' and see first hand what could be done to break the stalemate.</p>

<p>Americans found comfort in that, and today is really no different -- though we don't have a great military leader running for office.</p>

<p>We are a nation that is becoming war weary, almost to the point of seeing our military actions in the Middle East as status quo.</p>

<p>Like 1952, we need answers to break the stalemate.</p>
<h3>4. Challenging Party Surges in the Last Few Weeks of the Race</h3>
<p>All too many outlets were caught 'looking dumb' with their polls having Mitt Romney ahead by 2 points during the last few weeks of the 2012 presidential cycle.</p>

<p>It just seems to happen this way, with no good reason. However, as with anything, the polls are just tools, not precise measurements of America.</p>

<p>Strangely, it seems, that some of the most accurate polling in post mortem analysis tends to be <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/08/24/tea-leaves-august-polling-starting-settle/" rel="noopener noreferrer">August</a> and September's polls, with October polls susceptible to this strange phenomenon.</p>
<h3>5. The Taller Candidate Wins Most of the Time</h3>
<p>In fairness, the previous elections have all been between men, but physical stature seems to play a role.</p>

<p>With Donald Trump towering at 6'3" this may in all reality be the greatest spread between any two candidates -- with Hillary Clinton coming in at 5' 5."</p>

<p>Clinton has exploited this height disadvantage a few times, especially during the debates when she placed herself between the camera and Donald Trump -- giving the appearance of him 'lurching' even when he was standing at his own podium.</p>

<p>Idealized body form has been an important part of a leader's qualities since the most ancient of times. In 21st century America, we still haven't lost this 'need' to connect with our leaders on the physical level.</p>
<h3>6. The World Series is Indicating a Hard Fought Race for Both Sides</h3>
<p>One of the goofier political axioms is the World Series outcome -- where the location of each team on the red/blue map has 'predictive' powers.</p>

<p>This year, the Chicago Cubs in deep blue territory face off with the Cleveland Indians -- from toss-up Ohio.</p>

<p>With the Cubs now only one game away from elimination, this axiom plays into a lot of America's worst fears -- that the election is anyone's game.</p>

<hr>

<p>While these axioms are fun to consider, there's one that should shock and even appall Americans -- over 40 percent of eligible voters choose to not cast a ballot in the presidential elections.</p>

<p>Greater voter participation would fundamentally alter the entire political landscape in America, but we simply don't use the simplest of American rights to change our political future.</p>

<p>It's not just this generation. The highest voter turnout ever was in 1860 with 80.1 percent of the eligible voters casting ballots. But otherwise, voter engagement hovers in the mid-50's for presidential races, high 40's for mid-terms.</p>

<p>We need a new axiom in America -- that we have a population that cares enough about our future to get to the polls each and every election.</p>

<p>This would set into motion a completely unpredictable new world of politics -- and who would really know what the end result would be?</p>

<p>But it would be the people's choice, not the parties, political PACs, billionaire political donors, or 'party faithful.'</p>

<p>We need an engaged America, one that tackles the issues of the day, not the party-line ramblings and campaign messages.</p>

<p>One certainty is clear: if Americans started voting in droves, we'd have scared politicians, ones who actually tried to figure out what the voters wanted.</p>

<p>And how could that be a bad thing?</p>
