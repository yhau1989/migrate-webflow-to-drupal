<p>In a series of tweets over recent days, Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein unloaded on the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton. With many Republicans abandoning GOP nominee Donald Trump for Clinton, Stein sees the emergence of what she calls&nbsp;#TheNewRepublicanParty.</p>

<p>Many of these tweets were published during Sunday's debate as topics ranged from the economy to foreign policy to crime -- when both candidates were not airing each other's dirty laundry, that is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/10/expanding_the_debate_jill_stein_debates" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democracy Now</a> aired Jill Stein "debating" alongside Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, simulating what it would possibly look like if Stein was included in Sunday's debate.</p>

<p>In her tweets, Stein even brought up the latest Wikileaks documents that among other things show further collusion between the DNC and the Clinton campaign as well as indications that some leaders of the&nbsp;Democratic Party did everything&nbsp;they could to ensure Clinton beat U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary.</p>

<p>One of the biggest groups Stein targeted in her efforts to gain ballot access in as many states as possible and to boost her support nationwide was Bernie Sanders supporters disenchanted with the outcome of the Democratic presidential nomination process. Though Sanders endorsed Clinton, many of his supporters to this day are reluctant to join the "I'm With Her" train.</p>

<p>Former Sanders supporters helped Stein <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/08/02/jill-stein-ballot-access-gains/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gain ballot access</a> in <a href="http://www.jill2016.com/ballot_access" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 states, plus the District of Columbia</a>. However, Stein has not moved much in the national polls, polling as high as two percent as of late. IVN has reported <a href="http://ivn.us/author/rodolfocortes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensively</a> on the controversial methods used by some of these national polls, which have underserved <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/02/major-poll-used-cpd-drastically-samples-independents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">independents</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/10/04/nbc-wsj-poll-disadvantages-low-income-americans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-income households</a>, and an <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/09/05/cnn-presidential-polls-used-cpd-shortchange-entire-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">entire generation of voters</a>.</p>

<p>With little name recognition and mostly zero media exposure (apart from the plethora of articles that say a vote for Stein is a vote for Donald Trump), Stein has no chance in the election. However, like the other third party candidates running for president, if Stein can garner 5 percent of the vote, it would ensure that her party's nominee will qualify for federal funding in 2020.</p>
