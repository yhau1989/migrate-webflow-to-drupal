<p>San Diego, CALIF.- Measure M aims to increase the maximum number of housing units in the City of San Diego for people with low incomes.</p>

<p>If approved, the City and other applicable public agencies would be allowed to help develop, construct, and/or acquire 10,000&nbsp;<em>more</em> units for those with low incomes. Currently, the state is allowed 28,680 units.</p>

<p>Supporters point to California's critical housing shortage, and reason the city must take action to provide more housing. The&nbsp;Legislative Analyst's Office's <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>&nbsp;"California's High Housing Costs: Causes and Consequences" rated California as the 2nd worst state for providing adequate housing.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3345" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up</a> to their March 2015 report the LAO published a February 2016 report, "Perspectives on Helping Low-Income Californians Afford Housing," where they proposed a solution to California's lack of housing. To ensure housing for low-income Californians, the LAO recommends the expansion of low-income programs, and focusing on the construction of market-rate housing to mitigate displacement.</p>

<p>The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) performed an <a href="http://www.hcd.ca.gov/housing-policy-development/housing-resource-center/plan/he/sandag_5rhna112310.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">assessment</a> and&nbsp;found that 10,000 additional units would be the number of units needed by 2020 to alleviate the housing concerns.</p>

<p>There is no organized campaigns on either side of the measure, though&nbsp;there are arguments submitted to the ballot. The supporting&nbsp;argument&nbsp;states&nbsp;the additional units must be built in order to meet the city's growing population's needs.</p>
