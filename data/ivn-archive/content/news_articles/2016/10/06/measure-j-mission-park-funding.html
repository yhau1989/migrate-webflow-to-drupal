<p>San Diego, CALIF.- The transition of funding from Mission Bay Park to San Diego's other regional parks could mean more efficient capital improvements for the city's parks.</p>

<p>If Measure J passes, it would act as the extension of an <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/city-clerk/pdf/elections/city/081104ballotmeasures.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier ballot measure</a>, amending&nbsp;the charter by increasing financial support&nbsp;to the City's Regional Parks Improvement Fund. The funding&nbsp;comes from Mission Bay Park lease revenue exceeding $20 million&nbsp;and&nbsp;would go up from 25% to 35%.</p>

<p>Simply put, the fiscal <a href="http://www.sdvote.com/content/dam/rov/en/proptext/1108_MEAS_J.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact of this measure</a> would consist of&nbsp;a shift in lease revenues from the Mission Bay Park Improvement Fund to the City's Regional Parks Improvement Fund.&nbsp;Under the context of this measure, Mission Bay Park would still receive 65% of lease revenues.</p>

<p>Essentially, supporters say this will mean more money for regional park improvements in general, rather than&nbsp;to Mission Bay&nbsp;exclusively.</p>

<p>However, controversy stems from the section of the measure that delineates&nbsp;contiguous land parcels be added to Mission Bay Regional Park. Some are concerned that this addition of land could possibly be used as a loophole in the&nbsp;allowance of only 25% of the park to be developed. Opponents say increasing the size of the park could in turn, increase commercialization of the area, including the construction of a new hotel.</p>

<p>Supporters say Yes on Measure J means extending&nbsp;the timeline of the&nbsp;restricted use of lease revenue over $20 million in Mission Bay from 2039 to 2069.</p>
