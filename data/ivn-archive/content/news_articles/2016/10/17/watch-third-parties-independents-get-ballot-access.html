<p>We over at <a href="http://youtube.com/thirdcandidates" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third Candidates</a>&nbsp;took time this summer and fall to learn more about the process independent and third party candidates go through in order to be granted ballot access.</p>

<p>Like a lot of things in our system, ballot access is badly in need of simplification<span>&nbsp;so political competition can be a little more free flowing. Just like getting on a debate stage, being on the ballot brings an air of viability to a candidate. Keeping that at arms length is an effective way to stifle competition. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If an individual can't easily get ballot access, or a party can't provide it, ambitious, up-and-coming politicians are more likely to join the D or R parties.</p>

Anyway, this&nbsp;one was a blast to produce. We visited Virginia, New Hampshire, Maine, and the Hudson valley area of New York. John learned to drive a tractor. I learned new tricks on how to eat lobster.

<p>Our next episode will look into a&nbsp;reform&nbsp;that many readers of this site are probably aware of: Ranked Choice Voting.</p>
