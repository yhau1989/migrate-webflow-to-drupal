<p>A U.S. Supreme Court decision <a href="http://www.progressillinois.com/news/content/2016/10/06/independent-candidate-exits-illinois-13th-congressional-district-race" rel="noopener noreferrer">last week</a> will keep an independent candidate in Illinois off the November ballot.</p>

<p>The high court denied independent David Gill's request to vacate an order by a lower&nbsp;appeals court to leave him&nbsp;off the ballot in Illinois' 13th congressional district. The ruling effectively ends Gill's campaign.</p>

<p>The only two names that will&nbsp;appear on the November 8 ballot are Democrat Mark Wicklund and incumbent Republican Rodney Davis.</p>

<p>Gill previously <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/08/08/illinois-independent-candidate-sues-stringent-ballot-access-laws/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed</a>&nbsp;a lawsuit to appear on the ballot, charging that the number of signatures necessary for an independent candidate to obtain is "severe and overly burdensome. As an independent, Gill <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/news/20161007/illinois-independent-candidate-david-gill-ends-us-house-campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer">needed</a> at least 10,754 signatures <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/illinois/government-and-politics/elections/gill-ends-bid-after-nd-supreme-court-rejection/article_c7a0e63d-3ccc-53d8-9ad8-93f344b520e0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">compared</a> to 740 for major party candidates.</p>

<p>Gill collected more than the required amount, but a review <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/illinois/government-and-politics/elections/gill-ends-bid-after-nd-supreme-court-rejection/article_c7a0e63d-3ccc-53d8-9ad8-93f344b520e0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">determined</a>&nbsp;that approximately 8,500 of the signatures were valid. Gill was short by more than 2,000 valid signatures.</p>

<p>Part of Gill's issue is that the district includes&nbsp;towns where signature collectors may be unsure of the congressional borders. The Democratic candidate, Wicklund, challenged Gill's signatures in July partly on the grounds that several were from <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/11/david-gill-runs-illinois-13th-congressional-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer">outside</a> the district.</p>

<p>This year marked Gill's fifth campaign for Congress. He ran four times as a Democrat, but 2016 signified the first time he sought office as an independent. Gill narrowly lost in 2012 to current incumbent Rodney Davis.</p>

<p>Gill indicated he may run again in 2018. Acknowledging that the major parties essentially control elections, Gill conceded he may have to run as a Democrat again. Stating that&nbsp;the Constitution is "rendered virtually meaningless," he <a href="http://www.progressillinois.com/news/content/2016/10/06/independent-candidate-exits-illinois-13th-congressional-district-race" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"It may be that the only way to gain access to the ballot is by running in a primary of one of the major parties which require fewer than 740 signatures."</blockquote>
<p>Illinois' 13th congressional district <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/IL/13" rel="noopener noreferrer">extends</a> from the Mississippi River in the west to Bloomington in the north and east to Champaign. The district <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/house/2014_elections_house_map.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">leans</a> Republican and becomes more so with the exclusion of Gill. From Wall Street and health care, Gill's policy positions <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/07/11/david-gill-runs-illinois-13th-congressional-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer">resemble</a> those of Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>

Despite losing the ballot battle, Gill will continue his lawsuit against the burdensome signature threshold for independent candidates. "The overall lawsuit is probably more important than me being on [the] ballot in 2016," Gill <p><a href="http://peoriapublicradio.org/post/gills-gone-lawsuit-could-help-future-independent-candidates#stream/0" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on Peoria public radio.</p>
