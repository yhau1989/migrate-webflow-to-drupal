<p>San Diego, CALIF.- The push to tax pot could be a big money generator for the city of San Diego if a statewide proposition passes.</p>

<p>If California voters approve Proposition 64, which would make it legal for adults to use marijuana, Measure N, if it passes, would impose a sales tax on businesses that sell marijuana for recreational use.</p>

<p>Councilman Kersey's measure dictates that the tax would begin at 5 percent and increase to 8 percent in 2019. At that time the City Council could adjust the tax higher, but never rise above 15 percent. The revenue would go into the city’s general fund.</p>

<p>Kersey argued the genesis for Measure N was dictated by code enforcement and public safety. The state measure could also levy its own 15 percent sales tax on marijuana, but Kersey said the city should make sure a local tax would take care of expenses related to regulating the drug.</p>

<p>Advocates, like the United Marijuana Medical Coalition, cautioned against setting the rate too high. At the rules committee and City Council hearings, the UMMC stated a higher rate could make it harder for legitimate businesses to compete with black-market sellers.</p>

<p>The city’s independent budget analyst estimates a 5 percent tax could raise around $22 million a year. A&nbsp;number that is admittedly dependent on a number of variables, like how easy the city makes it to open a recreational marijuana dispensary, the price of recreational marijuana and its availability in other markets.</p>
