<p>There are many good reasons to oppose San Diego County’s Measure B – the Lilac Hills sprawl development project -- on the November 2016 ballot. All of them can be summed up like this: ballot-box planning allows developers to sidestep important public oversight that protects taxpayers and ensures orderly, responsible housing development.</p>

<p>Updated after more than a decade of public input and expert review, today’s general&nbsp;land-use&nbsp;plan&nbsp;for San Diego County&nbsp;allows 110 homes and&nbsp;no&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;uses on 608 rural acres that Measure B’s sponsor&nbsp;owns in&nbsp;northern San Diego County. If approved,&nbsp;Measure B&nbsp;would&nbsp;ALLOW&nbsp;the developer to build&nbsp;1,746&nbsp;new homes – a 15-fold increase over what the County has already approved -- and&nbsp;90,000 sq. ft. of commercial uses&nbsp;on the property.</p>

<p>This development&nbsp;will place&nbsp;its&nbsp;5,200 future residents&nbsp;– more people than live in the&nbsp;City of Del Mar&nbsp;--&nbsp;in a rural agricultural area with&nbsp;very&nbsp;little existing urban infrastructure (roads, schools, urban fire and emergency medical services, sewer, and other utility services).</p>

<p>Measure B&nbsp;fails to&nbsp;include&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the San Diego County&nbsp;Planning Commission’s&nbsp;September 11, 2015&nbsp;conditions for approval:&nbsp;paying&nbsp;for&nbsp;extensive improvement to area&nbsp;roads, 5-minute fire service and EMS, and&nbsp;other required improvements.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Board of Supervisors ordered an&nbsp;independent&nbsp;impact report on&nbsp;Measure B that was completed August 2, 2016. Here’s what that report&nbsp;demonstrates:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>San Diego County&nbsp;needs affordable&nbsp;housing. However,&nbsp;Measure B&nbsp;makes zero commitments to building affordable housing&nbsp;at&nbsp;ANY&nbsp;price level. (The claim by Measure B’s backers that the homes would sell for just&nbsp;$300,000&nbsp;is not contained in the actual language of the measure and is therefore unenforceable.)</li>
 	<li>Measure B will significantly contribute to traffic gridlock on I-15. The County has calculated that alleviating the I-15 gridlock will cost $1&nbsp;billion. Measure B pays&nbsp;nothing toward I-15 improvements. Taxpayers must shoulder&nbsp;the cost to reduce the additional congestion&nbsp;if Measure B is approved.</li>
 	<li>The&nbsp;homes would be located&nbsp;in&nbsp;Calfire’s&nbsp;Very High and High Fire Hazard Severity Zones. The County&nbsp;requires a&nbsp;5-minute response for fire service and&nbsp;other&nbsp;EMS. However, Measure B promises only 10-minute response times.</li>
</ol>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Union-Tribune</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Voice of San Diego</em>&nbsp;have independently “fact checked” Measure B. Both have concluded&nbsp;that Measure B is a bad deal for San Diego County.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Union-Tribune</em>&nbsp;has come out against Measure B and&nbsp;summarized its reasoning for opposing&nbsp;this “flawed and misleading”&nbsp;project&nbsp;in this way:&nbsp;“It’s a bad proposal – and an awful precedent.”</p>

<p>Vote “no” on Measure B.&nbsp; The facts prove it's <strong>BAD</strong> for&nbsp;San Diego County.</p>
