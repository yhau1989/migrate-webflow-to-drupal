<p>An author who is attempting to expose security vulnerabilities to consumers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-court-block-us-prosecuting-security-researcher-detecting-and-publishing" rel="noopener noreferrer">could</a> face a lawsuit from the government for his efforts.</p>

<p><a href="https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Green</a>, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute, is writing a book tentatively titled,&nbsp;<em>Practical Cryptographic Engineering</em>. However, in obtaining research data for this project, Green could be violating copyright law. The digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="https://www.eff.org/about" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFF</a>) filed an order last <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-court-block-us-prosecuting-security-researcher-detecting-and-publishing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thursday</a> against the government to not prosecute Green.</p>

<p>Green's research seeks to expose the weaknesses in computer programs that make them vulnerable to hackers.</p>

<p>However, it also requires that he&nbsp;work directly with computer code which is protected by U.S. copyright law. While normally such research would be classified as "fair use," computer researchers can be penalized for selling such a book.&nbsp;Green's findings have implications for customers' smartphones, ATMs, and other electronic devices.</p>

<p>The EFF first <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed</a> lawsuit on Green's behalf in July. Significantly, the EFF challenges the constitutionality of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The act institutes prohibitions on discussion of copyrighted material. <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/1201/" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Section 1201 of the U.S. Copyright code, it is:</p>
<blockquote>"...illegal to circumvent technological measures used to prevent unauthorized access to copyrighted works, including copyrighted books, movies, videos, video games, computer programs."</blockquote>
<p>If the lawsuit is successful, the EFF could demonstrate that the DMCA's provisions are violations of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>Green says his work is vital for protecting consumers. Yet companies' self-interest could prevent his and others' research from helping those clients. Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/07/28/statement-on-dmca-lawsuit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on his blog in July:</p>
<blockquote>"Companies use the courts to silence researchers who have embarrassing things to say about their products, or who uncover too many of those products' internal details."</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department wants the court to dismiss the EFF's lawsuit. Rather, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/dept-justices-brief-support-motion-dismiss" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a> Green and the EFF lack the standing to make the suit. They make this charge because to date there has not been a threat of prosecution.</p>

<p>Although if prosecuted, Green and anyone doing research like his face onerous penalties which can <a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/07/21/eff-is-suing-the-us-government.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a> a five-year imprisonment.</p>

<p>According to EFF attorney Kit Walsh, the research of Professor Matthew Green is an important public service. She <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/30/green_asks_protection_from_dmca_lawsuits/" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a>, "If we want our communications and devices to be secure, we need to protect independent security researchers like Dr. Green."</p>
