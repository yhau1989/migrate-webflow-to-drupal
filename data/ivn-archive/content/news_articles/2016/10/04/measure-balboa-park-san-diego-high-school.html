<p>San Diego, CALIF.- Measure I regards the leasing of Balboa Park lands to San Diego High School. A "yes" vote&nbsp;would continue the lease of Balboa Park lands to San Diego High School, allowing the students and the&nbsp;campus to remain.</p>

<p>Approval of Measure I would authorize a new lease for the school and allow the use of park lands by the high school.</p>

<p>Proponents <a href="http://kogo.iheart.com/onair/the-demaio-report-56776/measure-i-to-let-san-diego-15165492/" rel="noopener noreferrer">argue</a> against displacing the school's students onto other campuses, as well as against the waste in tax money to find a new site and build a new school.</p>

<p>If Measure I does not pass, the 34 acres would return to the city for park use by 2024. The high school campus would likely be demolished.</p>

<p>Opponents&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/sdut-san-diego-high-school-balboa-park-lease-measure-i-2016sep09-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">argue</a> the land should be reverted to public park uses, and find that there are a number of potential locations for San Diego High to rebuild on.</p>

<p>City Councilmember&nbsp;<a href="http://sdcitybeat.com/article-17826-Measure-I-Determining-the-future-of-San-Diego-High.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Alvarez</a> was a San Diego High attendee who remembers the frequent field trips to museums. Councilmember Alvarez&nbsp;argues students have the opportunity to&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;Balboa Park's importance when their school is part of the park, and&nbsp;shapes its curriculum.</p>

<p>San Diego Unified has withheld an investment of $30 million for improvements to the campus until the leasing controversy is resolved. The school has occupied the southwestern corner of the park since 1882. In 1974, a lease was signed to legalize the high school's occupation&nbsp;of park lands.</p>
