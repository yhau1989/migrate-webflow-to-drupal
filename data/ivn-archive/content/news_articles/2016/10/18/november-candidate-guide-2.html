<p><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong> -&nbsp;San Diego’s election system doesn't look like the state&nbsp;of California.</p>

<p>Since 1989, the City has had an election loophole, allowing candidates who receive over 50% of the primary vote to be automatically elected and skip the electorate in the November general election. Voters are challenging this election system through a <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/10/07/measures-d-k-l-san-diego-voter-reform-measures/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballot initiative</a>. If passed, Measure K will change the system starting in 2018.</p>

<p>The current loophole meant 4 of the 7 races for the City of San Diego ended in the June primary, leaving just three races on November’s ballot: Districts 1 and 9, and City Attorney.</p>
