<blockquote><em>1 in 3 seniors will eventually face some form of dementia</em> -- <a href="http://www.alz.org/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alzheimer's Association FAQs</a></blockquote>
<p>A year ago, I discussed the problems associated with an <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/06/12/dementia-patients-allowed-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">overwhelming aging population</a> and the legal intricacies of dementia patients voting.</p>

<p>My own grandmother, a lifetime voter, falls into this category -- at 97 years old, she's mentally 'lost' somewhere in the 1920s to 1940s, and it makes me question how 'fit' she really is to be deciding the future of our nation.</p>

<p>This is a problem that isn't going away, yet it's one that is consistently ignored by our politicians.</p>

<p>The elderly never 'like' to have their freedoms taken away -- who would? Like I had told my grandmother when she was in her early 80s, 'once you have a car wreck that is your fault, you need to 'hang up' the driving so that you don't hurt yourself or others.'</p>

<p>And so many elderly are in similar positions.</p>

<p>They quit driving because of accidents, enter care homes because of an inability for self-care or family-assisted care, and eventually enter palliative care when their bodies just wear out from the strain of old age.</p>

<p>These are just harsh realities that millions of American families face on a daily basis.</p>

<p>As a group, the oldest generations have consistently been the largest percentage voters in America.</p>

<p>My own grandmother has been a lifetime voter; as her mobility declined, she opted for mail-in ballots.</p>

<p>But at what point is 'she' filling out the ballot, or is it the person 'helping' her fill out the ballot that is actually voting?</p>

<p>As I wrote a year ago, there are really no laws on this subject -- and nothing has really changed over the past year.</p>

<p>I am wholly against schemes by political ilks that are designed to decrease voter turnout, but I cannot fathom a political system that would allow for someone to essentially 'double-vote' when helping a dementia patient fill out the ballot.</p>

<p>In a political climate that worries about voter fraud on a massive scale, only to turn up a <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/14/how-200-promised-voter-fraud-cases-turned-one-prosecution/" rel="noopener noreferrer">handful of real cases</a>, we are missing the proverbial mountain for the mole-hill when it comes to an impending problem that is only getting worse.</p>

<p>We, as an American people, are going to have to make some hard choices when it comes to this problem -- politically 'suicidal' choices for politicians, knowing full-well they need the support of the aging vote at election time.</p>

<p>But we must face this reality -- that voter fraud among dementia patients is almost certainly more likely than any other kind of voter fraud.</p>

<p>It's time to stop worrying about dead voters, illegal immigrants voting, or other frauds lawmakers&nbsp;have spent millions trying to find -- and start worrying about a problem that is growing exponentially as the Boomers age.</p>

<p>It's hard to be bluntly honest like this, from either of the two-party's perspective.</p>

<p>But this is an American problem, one we are going to have to face together as our nation ages.</p>

<p>Because if we aren't willing to face it, we might as well start giving all younger voters two or three ballots to cast -- because that's where we are heading.</p>
