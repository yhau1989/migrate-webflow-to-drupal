<p>San Diego, CALIF.- Measure B, the planned community known as Lilac Hills Ranch, was the subject of an editorial from the San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board this week.</p>

<p>The Editorial posted October 7, 2016.</p>

<p>The following is a sample of what was published:</p>
<blockquote>"California is in desperate need of new housing. Once the cost of living is factored in, the Golden State has the highest rate of poverty in the nation, with more than one in five households living paycheck to paycheck. The prime reason is the extreme cost of housing. So this editorial board has fervently supported Gov. Jerry Brown’s efforts to streamline regulations to add housing stock — the only serious, long-term way to bring down rents and home prices.

You might then presume we’d be inclined to support Measure B, which asks county voters to clear the way for the Lilac Hills Ranch project in North County, which developer Accretive Investments says will bring 1,746 new homes to a bucolic 608-acre area of Valley Center just east of Interstate 15. It made the Nov. 8 ballot after Accretive funded a signature-gathering initiative."</blockquote>
