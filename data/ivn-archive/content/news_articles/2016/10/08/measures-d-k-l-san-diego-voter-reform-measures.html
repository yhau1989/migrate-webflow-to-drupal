<p><span>San Diego, CALIF.- Three measures are going before the voters in the City of San Diego this November 8th that concern voters rights: they are D, K and L.</span></p>

<p>Measures D, K and L have been targeted by both political parties as being critical to the future of San Diego. And, each side has conveyed credible points for their arguments. Here’s the critical component of each measure:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Measure D replaces the current 2% (effective 12.5% hotel tax) TMD voted on by the hoteliers with a voter approved TOT increase set at 14-15.5%. &nbsp;This revenue would be directed to the general fund.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Measure K would change the City Charter, beginning in 2018, to allow the candidates who finish in the top two in a primary, to run against each other in the November general election. It would eliminate the rule that ends elections in the primary if a candidate or measure gets at least 50 percent plus one of the vote.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Measure L, similar to Measure K, would require that ballot initiatives be decided in the November elections, when the most people participate. It would also bring conform San Diego’s ballot initiative process with statewide elections. The same supporters and opponents attached to Measure K are the same for Measure L.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The Yes on D, K and L support appears to be growing. The San Diego Democratic Party has endorsed all three reform measures. In a statement to IVN San Diego, “The Democratic Party of San Diego County has a long history of supporting measures that benefit our communities, preserve the environment, and protect local taxpayers. We enthusiastically support Measure D and ask voters to do the same. Of particular importance, Measure D would pave the way for new parks and higher education in Mission Valley, all at no risk to taxpayers. We are proud to join the growing coalition which includes the League of Women Voters, the League of Conservation Voters, Former Councilmember Donna Frye, and Councilmember David Alvarez in supporting Yes on D.”</span></p>

<p><span>San Diego Firefighters lead the K and L coalition and the League of Women Voters lead a coalition of community and environmental groups supporting Yes on D. </span></p>

<p><span>Along with the City of San Diego Firefighters, Measures K and L are supported by City councilman Todd Gloria and Council President Sherri Lightner.</span></p>
