<p>San Diego, CALIF.- Measure E is one of those charter amendments that everyone seems to be supporting. &nbsp;The measure&nbsp;would make it easier to remove and replace elected city officials who’ve committed crimes or other wrongdoing.</p>

<p>It states the mayor, city attorney and City Council members must be removed from their job if they're convicted of a felony, found civilly liable for fraud or declared incapacitated by a court.</p>

<p>The measure would also create a new process to remove elected city officials convicted of certain misdemeanors.</p>

<p>Under those circumstances, three-fourths of the City Council could vote to hold a special removal election. Voters would need to approve the removal of the public official.</p>

<p>Measure E seems like common sense Charter reform. Interestingly though, the city attorney's office says San Diego would become the first city in California with such a Council-initiated special removal election.</p>

<p>The measure would also require city attorney candidates to be licensed to practice law in California for at least 10 years.</p>

<p>Measure E was essentially created in the wake of the&nbsp;Mayor Bob Filner scandal. Filner resigned in late August 2013 amid an onslaught of sexual harassment allegations. Currently, the City Charter only allows for the mayor to be removed through a recall election. Officials&nbsp;negotiated a&nbsp;deal to get him to resign.</p>

<p>Irene McCormack, the first woman to publicly accuse the mayor of sexual harassment, recently wrote an <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sd-utbg-trump-filner-abuse-20161014-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">op-ed in the San Diego Union-Tribune.</a> McCormack stated, "By the time I made the decision to “show my face, former Councilwoman Donna Frye and attorneys Marco Gonzalez and Cory Briggs had held two press conferences demanding the mayor resign."</p>

<p>A charter review committee, with help from the city attorney’s office, drafted this measure.</p>
