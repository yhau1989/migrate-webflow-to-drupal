<p><strong>Washington</strong> –&nbsp; Super PACs are once again breaking records &nbsp;–<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php" rel="noopener noreferrer"> topping $1.1 billion </a>– but there’s a new wrinkle. Instead of aiming their main financial artillery at the presidential race, Super PACs, political parties and outside donors have committed more than half a billion dollars to the battle for control of the Senate – more money than they’re spending on the race for the White House.</p>

When it comes to buying TV ads for current Senate campaigns, outside groups have outspent the Democratic and Republican parties and the candidates combined, according to Michael Franz, a Bowdoin College professor who tracks broadcast ad spending. “The proportion of outside spending is at an all-time high,” says Franz. And <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=R" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;80% of all that money goes for negative attack ads, according to the </a><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=R" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Responsive Politics</a><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=R" rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a>

The Niagara of money now cascading into Senate races is astonishing and unprecedented – <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/299296-battle-for-senate-crosses-half-billion-dollar-mark" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly $100 million for tiny New Hampshire (pop 1.3 million); $90 million for Pennsylvania; nearly $80 million for Ohio; $65 million for Nevada; and $150 million more </a>for Florida, Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina, according to marketers who track television ad bookings, cited by <em>The Hill</em> newspaper, chronicler of Capitol Hill.

The peril is acute for the GOP because Republicans swept the 2010 mid-term elections and now have 24 Senate seats at risk this year, versus only 10 for the Democrats. They faced a tough fight even before Donald Trump’s lewd sex tape and incendiary stump talk caused his poll numbers to swoon and down-ballot Republican candidates to run for cover.
