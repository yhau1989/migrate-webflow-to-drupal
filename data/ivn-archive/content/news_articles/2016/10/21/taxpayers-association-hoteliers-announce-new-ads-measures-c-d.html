<p><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong> - The San Diego County Taxpayers Association (SDCTA) and the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Association have joined forces to speak out against Measures C and D.</p>

<p>SDCTA is now working on behalf of the hoteliers to defeat Measures C and D. Estimates put the hoteliers’ investment at $100,000 to defeat both measures.</p>

<p>At a news conference Thursday, SDCTA President Haney Hong, alongside the Hotel Association Executive Director Namara Mercer and San Diego Tourism Authority CEO Joe Terzi, unveiled new “NO on C and D” video and radio ads that will start airing in San Diego less than 3 weeks before Election Day.</p>

<p>Hotel owners criticize C and D because both raise the Transient Occupancy Tax (aka the “Hotel Tax”), something the hoteliers and the tourism marketing district claim will hurt the tourism economy in San Diego.</p>

<p>Measure C would raise the TOT rate to 16.5%. Measure D would set the rate at 15.5%. Of note, the latter rate was the same number hoteliers pegged as a good figure for the local tourism economy years ago.</p>

<p>At 15.5%, San Diego’s TOT would still be lower than <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-los-angeles-visitors-for-2015-20160111-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-orange-county-tourism-record-20160205-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anaheim</a>, and <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/san-francisco-travel-reports-record-breaking-year-tourism" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco</a>. According to several reports, all three cities have seen an increase in tourism-related dollars over the last decade.</p>

<p>Historically, the San Diego County Taxpayers Association has not taken positions on land use decisions unless there were “significant fiscal implications.” The SDCTA staff recommended taking a “neutral&nbsp;position” on Measure D after conducting a thorough review of the initiative in August. However, the SDCTA board decided against staff recommendations and issued an official opposition to the measure.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Hong said the Taxpayers Association is not opposed to the Chargers, but called Measures C and D “one-sided” and a “bad deal for taxpayers.”</p>

<p>If passed, Measure D would prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to fund the construction of a new downtown football stadium, though it would create an entertainment zone where a downtown stadium could be built with another vote. If the Chargers depart Mission Valley, D would reimagine the 162 acres of the Qualcomm Stadium site for higher education and park lands.</p>

<p>Measure C doesn’t contemplate Mission Valley and is solely focused on downtown.</p>
