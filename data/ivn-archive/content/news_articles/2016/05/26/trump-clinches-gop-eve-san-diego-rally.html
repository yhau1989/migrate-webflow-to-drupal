<p><strong>San Diego, Calif.&nbsp;</strong>- When <strong>Donald Trump</strong> takes the stage Friday at the San Diego Convention Center, he will do so as the Republican presidential nominee.</p>

<p>Trump has had the nomination locked down for weeks, but he now has the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination as some delegates have switched their support to Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Steve House</strong>, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and an unbound delegate, confirmed his support of Trump to the Associated Press. House said he likes the billionaire's background as a businessman. "Leadership is leadership," House said. "If he can surround himself with the political talent, I think he will be fine."</p>

<p>The achievement is not going unnoticed within the Washington, D.C. power structure either. Some of the most respected conservative thinkers in the nation are weighing in on what Trump has done. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted, "No one in American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority, Trump's achievement is remarkable." Gingrich is rumored to be among the candidates on Trump's vice presidential short-list.</p>

<p>Supporters in San Diego shouldn’t expect any grand pronouncements Friday, as Trump will likely not formally accept the party's nomination until July, but it will no doubt add intrigue to the appearance.</p>

<p>In San Diego, Republican Mayor <strong>Kevin Faulconer</strong> continues to not support Trump, and he will not be at Friday’s rally for the GOP nominee. Faulconer reiterated his position at a televised debate this week, saying he would “not support the nominee,” that Trump hasn’t earned his vote.</p>

<p>IVN San Diego will be covering the Trump rally in San Diego Friday.</p>
