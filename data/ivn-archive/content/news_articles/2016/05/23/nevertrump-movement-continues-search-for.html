<p>Presidential candidates <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> are both rather unpopular. How unpopular? According to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnyt-poll-how-do-voters-view-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton/" rel="noopener noreferrer">one recent poll</a>, 52 percent of the public views Clinton unfavorably, and 55 percent views Trump unfavorably.</p>

<p>Because of this disaffection,&nbsp;a large sector of the electorate is eager for an independent candidate. According to <a href="http://datatargeting.com/POTUS/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a&nbsp;survey</a> by the firm Data Targeting, more than half of voters are in favor of seeing an independent on the November ballot, and the firm&nbsp;estimates that an independent would start off the general&nbsp;election with 21 percent of the popular vote.</p>

<p>Looking to offer another option is the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-29/the-die-hard-republicans-who-say-nevertrump" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NeverTrump movement</a>, led by conservative intellectuals, media personalities, and strategists who are looking to recruit and run a third party or independent candidate.</p>

<p>While the movement does not anticipate winning the election outright, it hopes to deprive the other candidates of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to clinch the presidency and thus turn the decision over to the House of Representatives. There,&nbsp;each state delegation would submit a single vote&nbsp;for one&nbsp;of the top three presidential candidates – <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/the_electoral_college#how_the_electoral_college_works_today" rel="noopener noreferrer">a scenario</a> that, given <a href="http://www.270towin.com/2016-house-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the likely composition</a> of the House in 2017, could result in the selection of the prospective conservative challenger.</p>

<p>Yet in recent weeks, several&nbsp;leaders of the movement — including <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Weekly Standard</em>&nbsp;founder and editor <strong>Bill&nbsp;Kristol</strong> and radio host and commentator <strong>Erick Erickson</strong> — have&nbsp;struggled in their search for a candidate.</p>

<p>Early potential recruits included Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis and billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, but both decided not to run.&nbsp;Cuban, explaining his hesitance to the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-gop-effort-to-draft-an-independent-candidate-to-derail-trump/2016/05/14/1b04682e-1877-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a>,&nbsp;"There isn’t enough time.”</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;a major challenge for an&nbsp;independent or third party late-comer is time — especially when it comes to&nbsp;<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Filing_deadlines_and_signature_requirements_for_independent_presidential_candidates,_2016" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballot access</a>. The <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/05/09/texas-deadline-independent-presidential-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">deadline</a>&nbsp;for filing the requisite number of signatures to appear on the Texas ballot&nbsp;passed earlier this month: a candidate who wishes to appear on the remaining ballots would need to collect and submit approximately&nbsp;800,000 signatures.</p>

<p>But in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/neither-clinton-nor-trump/article/2002274" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article</a> in&nbsp;<em>The Weekly Standard</em>&nbsp;on May 16, Kristol sounded optimistic about the prospects of making the movement's eventual candidate&nbsp;a viable option for all voters.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="A major challenge for an independent or third party late-comer is time — especially when it comes to ballot access." author=""]

<p>"Getting an independent candidate on the ballot in all 50 states is less difficult than conventional wisdom has it," he wrote,&nbsp;adding&nbsp;that any missed filing deadlines "are susceptible to legal challenges that are being drawn up."</p>

<p>And&nbsp;according to Mike Murphy, one of the strategists behind the movement, the candidate would not need to appear on every ballot to be effective&nbsp;— only enough ballots&nbsp;to prevent&nbsp;a candidate&nbsp;from reaching 270 Electoral College votes. Murphy has stated he wants to focus on battleground states that have lax ballot access&nbsp;laws, such as Colorado, New Hampshire, and Ohio.</p>

<p>To facilitate these efforts, the movement's leaders have formed a new party. On May 17, Kristol <a href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/renegade-party-a-new-home-for-conservative-rebels/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> on Twitter the creation of the <strong>Renegade Party</strong> — replete with <a href="http://www.neithertrumpnorhillary.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RenegadeParty" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/732599902908362756" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Kristol added,&nbsp;"All that’s needed now: a candidate."</p>

<p>But unfortunately for the movement, in recent days,&nbsp;several prospective candidates&nbsp;have declared that they are not interested in taking up the mantle.</p>

<p>Former GOP candidate and current Ohio Gov. John Kasich&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/4338009/john-kasich-third-party-republican/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> he is not interested, as has Republican&nbsp;Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska — <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ben-sasse-gop-senator-leads-nevertrump-movement" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the leaders</a> of the #NeverTrump movement. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/18/politics/mitt-romney-never-trump-independent-2016-campaign/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided against</a> running, and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280383-former-gop-senator-no-third-party-run-against-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">ditto</a> former Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The ongoing search for a candidate is delaying the&nbsp;movement's momentum. A source associated&nbsp;with the Renegade Party, who spoke on condition of remaining anonymous, told IVN that the party will be starting&nbsp;specific ballot access efforts in the coming weeks and is first concentrating on recruiting a candidate.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some&nbsp;conservatives are considering&nbsp;backing other candidates in the race. Writing for the&nbsp;<em>Los Angeles Times</em>, Matt Welch <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-welch-libertarians-never-trump-20160519-snap-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> the Libertarian Party the #NeverTrump movement's "last hope."</p>

<p>Though the party has not yet settled on a candidate, former Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson has reached <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/18/fox-news-poll-trump-tops-clinton-both-seen-as-deeply-flawed-candidates.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">double digits</a> in mock general election polls alongside&nbsp;Clinton and Trump, and Johnson is&nbsp;<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/19/exclusive-david-koch-pledges-millions-to-gary-johnsons-presidential-bid/#ixzz497e9RglJ" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> expected to receive a major fundraising boost from David Koch.</p>

<p>A Libertarian Party candidate could appeal not just to libertarians and conservatives, but also to fiscal conservatives and social liberals more broadly&nbsp;— and <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/03/28/sanders-doesnt-get-nomination-gary-johnson-may-catch-bern/" rel="noopener noreferrer">perhaps</a>&nbsp;some Bernie Sanders supporters.</p>

<p>Whichever way the movement goes, and especially if it splits, activists and organizers will need to mobilize quickly. With&nbsp;the first presidential debate <a href="http://www.2016presidentialdebateschedule.com/2015/09/cpd-announces-sites-and-dates-for-2016-general-election-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduled</a> for September 26,&nbsp;candidates only have a few more months to reach the <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 percent "level of&nbsp;support" threshold</a> needed&nbsp;to be included in the debates.</p>
