<p><span>On June 7, California voters will have an opportunity to weigh in on many important statewide races in the nonpartisan, top-two primaries. Voter participation in these contests may <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/24/ca-sec-state-nearly-200000-voters-register-online-final-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">get a boost</a> due to increased and steady interest in the presidential election.</span></p>

<p>One of the biggest political&nbsp;contests&nbsp;in 2016 is the U.S. Senate race for Sen. Barbara Boxer's open seat. Boxer is&nbsp;retiring&nbsp;after serving four terms -- nearly a quarter of a century -- in the upper chamber.</p>

<p>The race has a total of <a href="http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov//statewide-elections/2016-primary/june-2016-abbrev-candidates.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">34 candidates running</a>, which will make for a crowded ballot.&nbsp;Under Proposition 14, which implemented the top-two primary, voters can select from all candidates running in a race, regardless of political affiliation. The top two vote-getters then move on to the general election.</p>

<p>Top-two is used for&nbsp;all statewide races, except for the presidential election -- which has <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/16/independent-voters-disenfranchised-by-california-primary-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stricter rules</a> for participation.</p>

<p><span>Candidates have tried to differentiate themselves by garnering&nbsp;the support and endorsement of key political players. Yet according to the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), two candidates have <a href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_516MBS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">broken away</a> as the top two candidates heading into June.</span></p>

<p>Democratic California Attorney General <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>&nbsp;and Democratic U.S. Representative <strong>Loretta Sanchez</strong> stand a strong chance at being the first two candidates from the same party to face each other in a&nbsp;fall election for U.S. Senate in California. And both candidates have received major endorsements that could affect their candidacies in different ways.</p>

<p>Notably, Harris is backed by major state officials and party leaders, including Governor Jerry Brown (who also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/31/politics/jerry-brown-endorses-hillary-clinton/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed Hillary Clinton</a> for president on Tuesday) and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, as well as&nbsp;the California Democratic Party. Sanchez has been&nbsp;endorsed by&nbsp;24 editorial boards and news outlets -- the most in the race.</p>
<h4><strong>You can see the full list of Harris' endorsements <a href="http://www.kamalaharris.org/endorsements/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Sanchez's endorsements <a href="http://www.loretta.org/issues/endorsed" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong></h4>
<p><span>“[Harris is]&nbsp;strong. She’s intelligent. She knows what she’s doing,” Governor Brown said in brief remarks about his endorsement of&nbsp;Harris. "If you can survive San Francisco politics, Washington, D.C., is a cakewalk," Newsom <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160104-htmlstory.html#1090" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> of&nbsp;his endorsement.</span></p>

<p><span>Harris' supporters have</span><a href="http://www.laopinion.com/2015/10/26/kamala-harris-for-the-u-s-senate/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>praised her</span></a><span> for her work to tackle cybercrime, defending sanctuary cities, supporting public health, education, and safety for all, including undocumented people.</span></p>

<p><span>As a member of Congress, representing California's 46th district, many of the newspapers that have endorsed Sanchez have praised her for her fierce independence, strong sense of bipartisanship, and enduring pragmatism.</span></p>
<p>"The big difference between Sanchez and Harris is in legislative experience and understanding the back-and-forth required to get bills passed," the Fresno Bee editorial board <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article77077812.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>. "Sanchez holds senior positions on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Homeland Security Committee. A congresswoman doesn’t rise to these posts without the respect of colleagues."</p>
<p>In an interview with U.S. Rep. Sanchez, she said she has had to <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/14/democratic-candidate-loretta-sanchez-disagree-dnc-chair-let-independents-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cast&nbsp;some tough votes</a> that did not always adhere to what the&nbsp;party leadership wanted or toe the partisan&nbsp;line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I voted against the Iraq War, which has proven to be the largest foreign policy blunder in recent history. I voted against the so-called PATRIOT Act because it infringes upon our civil liberties. I voted against the Wall Street bailout because it was a raw deal for hardworking Americans who lost their homes due to risky Wall Street speculation. I have been and am still opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership because I refuse to engage in trade deals with countries that are serial human rights abusers and won’t treat their workers the way we would in the United States." - U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IVN reached out to Kamala Harris' campaign for an interview, but is still waiting for a response.</p>

<p><span>PPIC reports that Harris has an 8-point advantage over Sanchez. However,&nbsp;Tom Del Beccaro, the leading Republican in the race, is 11 points behind Sanchez. In a same-party matchup between the two candidates in November, the endorsements will likely be a key factor in swaying voters outside the Democratic Party.</span></p>
