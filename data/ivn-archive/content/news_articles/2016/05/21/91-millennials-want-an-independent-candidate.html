<p>A new&nbsp;study recently found&nbsp;that an overwhelming <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/343528-voters-want-independent-candidate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">91%</a>&nbsp;of voters under the age of 29 would&nbsp;like to see an independent candidate on the 2016 presidential ballot.</p>

<p>Data Targeting conducted a <a href="http://datatargeting.com/POTUS/" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> testing public sentiment toward the presidential candidates. They found that 58% of respondents of all age groups&nbsp;are dissatisfied with the current candidates, 55% favor placing an independent candidate on the presidential ticket, and 65% are either somewhat, pretty, or very willing to support a candidate who is not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>What is most astonishing is that 91% of those under the age of 29 want to have an independent candidate as an option in November. This is important as Millennials <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently surpassed</a> Baby Boomers as the nation's largest living generation.</p>
<h2><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></h2>
<p>Americans are left with two presumptive nominees that have historically high unfavorable ratings, 91% of the younger generation favor an independent candidate, and both political parties are losing registrants as more people choose to become unaffiliated with either major party.</p>

<p>In Data Targeting's study that simulates a three-way race between an independent candidate, Trump, and Clinton, the independent candidate wins 56% among those with an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Clinton.</p>

<p>Even billionaire <strong>David Koch</strong>, who has previously donated billions of dollars to Republican candidates, is now&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/19/gary-johnson-just-became-a-serious-presidential-contender/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly pledging</a> money to support Libertarian presidential candidate <strong>Gary Johnson</strong>, should he win the Libertarian nomination.</p>

<p>As satisfaction with government and the two major political parties is at an all-time low and no matter how much voters try to buck the establishment, Americans are still left with historically unfavorable options.</p>

<p>It is no wonder why citizens are taking it upon themselves to reform the system by <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/28/clinton-trump-alternatives-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">looking toward independent candidates</a> and campaigning for <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/03/28/15000-ca-voters-ask-sec-state-padilla-allow-voters-equal-access-presidential-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">public primaries</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/06/independent-redistricting-campaign-submits-570k-signatures-qualify-november-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nonpartisan redistricting</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/04/primaries-third-party-opportunity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a more representative voting system</a>, and other citizen-led initiatives that <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/13/colorados-unaffiliated-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fail to pass through state legislatures</a>.</p>
