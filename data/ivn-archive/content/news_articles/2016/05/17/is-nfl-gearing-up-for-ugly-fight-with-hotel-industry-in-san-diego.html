<p>Thirty-two cities across the country have professional football teams. Each of those cities has gone through the very difficult task of building a new stadium.</p>

<p>The Chargers’ search for a new stadium in San Diego has been well documented. The team's efforts the past 15 years or so have been met with a number of roadblocks -- either political, financial, and/or geographical. Getting any kind of consensus from the city has been a very difficult proposition.</p>

<p>With that as a backdrop, and after pursuing a relocation to Carson for more than a year, the Chargers have come back to San Diego to focus their efforts downtown.</p>

<p>The Chargers Initiative is one of three plans that have been in the public purview for about a year. Let’s look at the similarities and the differences of what’s been put forward.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/San-Diego-Stadium-Proposal-Chargers-NFL-Concept-304146921.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Mayor Kevin Faulconer/CSAG Plan</b></a></h3>
<p>Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s plan focuses on Mission Valley. The mayor directed the city council to authorize a $2.1 million EIR for a new stadium and development at the Qualcomm site. He also, in working with County Supervisor Ron Roberts, was prepared to give $350 million of taxpayer dollars for the efforts. The team decided they did not want to focus their energies and efforts on a Mission Valley solution.</p>
<h3><a href="https://citizensplan.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Citizens’ Plan For Tourism Reform</b></a></h3>
<p>Attorney Cory Briggs and City Councilmember Donna Frye put together a plan that offers no public money for a Chargers stadium. The plan does create a path for the Chargers to build a stadium downtown by layering the East Village as an entertainment/sports complex. It raises the Transient Occupancy Tax 5 cents to 15.5%. That money would go directly into the city’s General Fund. The biggest highlight of the plan is what it reimagines for the Qualcomm stadium site. It calls for a River Park campus expansion opportunity. The plan would protect and preserve park land and sell off the parcels at fair market value to SDSU, UCSD, or any community college.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.chargers.com/news/2016/03/30/faqs-regarding-citizens-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Chargers Initiative</b></a></h3>
<p>The Chargers Initiative says nothing about the Mission Valley site focusing solely on downtown. It calls for a 6-cent increase to the Transient Occupancy Tax to 16.5%.&nbsp;<span>This increase will also pay for a new tourism marketing program for the City of San Diego, which is part of the overall, integrated plan.</span> <span>The Chargers Initiative requires the pro team to contribute $650 million and agree to a 30-year lease with the City of San Diego. Under the terms of the Citizens’ Initiative, the project cannot be constructed until those conditions are satisfied.</span></p>

<hr>

<p>Neither the Chargers Initiative nor the Citizens’ Plan for Tourism Reform takes any money out of the General Fund. However, each relies on tourism-generated revenues. The Chargers appear to favor this approach over the mayor’s proposal to spend local taxpayer dollars on a stadium. No doubt not because they wouldn’t be willing to take the money, but because they doubt the ability of the politicians to convince the public to support spending local taxpayer money.</p>

<p>This should come as no surprise since the NFL has followed the model of attempting to identify ways to fund facilities through a combination of team and visitor-generated revenues.</p>
