<p>Across the nation, voters have routinely been confused by overly complex and non-inclusive presidential primary rules. Unfortunately, the trend will continue this June in the Golden State.</p>
<p>[button color="Danger" size="large" url="http://ivn.us/2016/05/17/elecciones-primarias-de-california-excluyen-votantes-independientes/" text="Para leer el artículo en español, da click aquí"]</p>
<p>For non-presidential elections in California, the rules are simple. Every registered voter, regardless of party, can vote for any candidate of their choosing thanks to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/02/10/proposition-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 14</a>, the 2010 initiative that created the nonpartisan, top-two primary.</p>

<p>This is not true of presidential primaries.</p>

<p>Because the state&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/11/secretary-state-office-fails-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">has failed to conduct a voter education effort</a>, there will be massive confusion in California, similar to the situations we witnessed in Arizona, New York, and elsewhere across the country. Half a million California voters who are mistakenly registered under the <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/03/15/millions-of-ca-voters-unaware-they-dont-have-a-say-in-presidential-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Independent Party</a>, for example, will not find out until election day that they can’t vote for any of the major party candidates.</p>

<p>The more than 850,000 <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/may/09/report-new-voters-may-influence-san-diego-races/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new registered</a> California voters (<a href="http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/60day-presprim-2016/hist-reg-stats.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">many of whom reject a party label</a>), <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/27/important-information-for-california-primary-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">face a complicated set of rules</a> that is likely to stifle participation this year.</p>

<p>Although California’s constitution calls for an “open presidential primary,” the secretary of state has allowed private&nbsp;political parties to choose whether or not they want non-members to participate in their taxpayer-funded&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fairvote.org/primaries#presidential_primary_or_caucus_type_by_state" rel="noopener noreferrer">primaries</a>. As a result, most voters are likely to be confused about their voting options.</p>

<p>The Republican, Green, and Peace &amp; Freedom parties have chosen to close “their” taxpayer-funded presidential primaries, and require voters to re-register with their party by May 23 in order to take part in their presidential nomination&nbsp;process.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party, and the American Independent Party have chosen to allow “No Party Preference” (independent) voters into their private nomination&nbsp;process.</p>

<p>And the extent of the secretary of state’s voter education program to educate California’s fast-growing nonpartisan voters? A single postcard sent to the homes of nonpartisan absentee voters asking them if they wanted to vote in either the Democratic, Libertarian, or American Independent primaries.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="1,894,661 voters will not have a say at all in the presidential contest unless they act quickly." author=""]

<p>Of the 2,153,024 independent absentee voters who were mailed the postcard, <a href="https://twitter.com/CA_120/status/730585548218204161" rel="noopener noreferrer">88% did <em>not</em> pick</a> a party ballot. In other words, <strong>1,894,661 voters will not have a say at all in the presidential contest unless they act quickly.</strong></p>

<p>“It is so disappointing that millions of Californians will not be able to vote for the most important office in America – the presidency – simply because they chose to register as [an independent],” said Republican Assemblymember Kristin Olsen.</p>

<p>Olsen was one of the authors of a <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/california_resolution_would_provide_for_a_nonpartisan_public_ballot_option_for_presidential_primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan resolution</a> that requested Secretary of State Alex Padilla to use his authority as the state’s chief administrator of elections to add a non-binding, nonpartisan “public option” ballot for voters who either can’t or don’t want to vote in a party’s presidential primary.</p>

<p>According to Paul Mitchell at Capitol Weekly, the central coast city of Santa Cruz received the most Democratic ballot requests, with 29% of their independent absentees responding. Cities like Sacramento (15%), San Diego (14%), Los Angeles (7%), and San Francisco (0%) had notably poor response rates.</p>

<p>Registrars, such as San Diego County’s Michael Vu, suggest getting in touch with the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices/" rel="noopener noreferrer">County Registrar of Voters</a> office to get the most up-to-update information on how to vote. Vu has released a number of press releases and updates on their <a href="http://www.sdvote.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">webpage</a> in order to disperse the most accurate information for the county. All materials are released in multiple languages to accommodate the diverse population.</p>
