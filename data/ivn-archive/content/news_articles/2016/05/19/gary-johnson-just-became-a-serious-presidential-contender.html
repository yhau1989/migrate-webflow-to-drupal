[gravityform id="115" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]The Daily Caller (TheDC)&nbsp;<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/19/exclusive-david-koch-pledges-millions-to-gary-johnsons-presidential-bid/#ixzz497e9RglJ" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Thursday</a> that billionaire David Koch has pledged "tens of millions of dollars" to support Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson in the 2016 election. This information reportedly was provided by a source within the Johnson campaign.</p>

<p>TheDC reports:</p>

<p><em>"Koch’s money will be made available should Johnson, a former two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, secure his second consecutive Libertarian Party presidential nomination, the source said.</em></p>

<p><em>The Libertarians will select their presidential ticket during the party’s national convention later this month in Orlando.</em></p>

<p><em>When asked about Koch’s eight-figure pledge to support Johnson, a source close to David <span>Koch</span> did not deny that such an agreement is in place."</em></p>

<p>Neither Koch's office nor Johnson campaign manager Ron Nielson are denying that the agreement has been made but Koch's office will not go on record with a statement just yet, and Johnson's campaign will not publicly confirm endorsement commitments ahead of the convention.</p>

<p>Johnson recently <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ea9c644d880c49baaeeee7a360b5b070/libertarian-gary-johnson-secures-running-mate" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced that his running mate</a> will be former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, a twice-elected Republican with libertarian leanings. Weld also has connection to casino mogul Steve Wynn, who previously endorsed Donald Trump, but could shift his support for the Johnson ticket.</p>

<p>“People are upset and are looking for an alternative to the broken two party system,” said Nevada Libertarian Party Chairman Brett H. Pojunis.</p>

<p>“If the Libertarian candidate is successful raising money, the media will have a hard time ignoring that candidate,” according to Pojunis. “Especially with a public hungry for an alternative to two of the most polarizing figures in American political history.”</p>
