<p><b>SAN DIEGO, CA</b><span> - <strong>Gerardo Gurrola’s</strong> time as Program Manager for the City of San Diego’s 9-1-1 Dispatch system has come to an end.</span></p>

<p>City officials confirmed Gurrola has resigned amid the controversy over unanswered calls and long hold times.</p>

<p>Gurrola’s replacement will be San Diego Police Department Captain Jerry Hara.</p>

<p>State mandates require police departments to try to answer 9-1-1 calls within 10 seconds at least 90 percent of the time. In April 2016, SDPD answered within the 10 second goal only 67 percent of the time.</p>

<p>The issue has become a central campaign talking point for those challenging the leadership of Republican incumbent<strong> Kevin Faulconer.</strong></p>

<p>Democrat Mayoral candidate San Diego lifeguard <strong>Ed Harris</strong> has been particularly critical of Faulconer on the issue that he says impacts public safety. Harris told NBC 7 San Diego, “He didn’t inherit this problem,” Harris said. “He owns this problem. Two and a half years. If you can’t fix something, in two and a half years, if you’re still talking about goals after two and a half years. If you worked in the private sector, you wouldn’t have a job.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I want to change the management from the very top because I really feel like this comes from the top down,” Independent candidate <strong>Lori Saldaña</strong> said in reaction to the news of Gurrola’s departure.</p>

<p>Mayor Faulconer has not issued a statement on the resignation. Faulconer has authorized more police officers to work dispatch with eight officers fielding calls and another 65 in training to assist dispatch when possible.</p>

<p>Faulconer has also announced an additional $652,000 to the SDPD budget to retain and recruit more dispatchers.</p>

<p>Voters will have the chance to voice their concerns they have on the June 7 primary.</p>
