<p>Two <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/21/colorado-considers-letting-independents-vote-presidential-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">efforts by the Colorado state legislature</a> to switch from a closed caucus system to a presidential primary died this week due to confusion over what to do with the state's 1.3 million unaffiliated voters.</p>

<p>Disillusionment with Colorado's closed caucus system reached a breaking point during the presidential caucus in March.</p>

<p>Democratic voters were frustrated at the <a href="http://www.coloradoindependent.com/158071/unexpected-turnout-throws-boulder-caucus-into-chaos" rel="noopener noreferrer">overcrowded precincts and long waits</a> while Republican voters didn't have the chance to participate as their <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/11/voter-burns-republican-party-registration-over-colorados-rigged-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">party decided against holding a caucus</a> in Colorado, opting for a state convention where only party insiders could choose the winner.</p>

<p>Many Coloradans saw this chaos as an opportunity to petition lawmakers to switch to a presidential primary.</p>

<p>But, during debate this week, Republicans and Democrats could not come to an agreement on whether unaffiliated voters would have to either fully or temporarily register with a party in order to participate in the proposed presidential primary.</p>

<p>House Bill 16-1454, which would have let unaffiliated voters register with a party for one day in order to participate in the primary process, died because <a href="http://www.coloradoindependent.com/159241/want-a-presidential-primary-lawmakers-vote-no-for-now" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawmakers did not want to rush</a>&nbsp;legislation.</p>

<p>The second bill, Senate Bill 16-216 died Monday (5/9). This bill would have established a presidential primary open to only Democratic and Republican voters.</p>

<p>Unaffiliated voters in Colorado now make up almost <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VoterRegNumbers/VoterRegNumbers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">37 percent</a> of the electorate, outnumbering both Democrats and Republicans. Despite being the majority, unaffiliated voters must register as a Democrat or Republican to vote in the caucus.</p>

<p>And, as the debate among Colorado lawmakers this week shows, efforts to reform the system only go so far to include the state's majority of unaffiliated voters.&nbsp;The discussion still centered on forcing unaffiliated voters to change their party registration in order to exercise their most fundamental democratic right.</p>
<h3><strong>Why can't unaffiliated voters simply vote without having to register with a party first?</strong></h3>
<p>Political consultant and Colorado resident Jim Jonas <a href="https://www.cpr.org/news/story/what-we-know-about-colorados-unaffiliated-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Colorado Public Radio</a> that more Americans are registering as unaffiliated because they see government dysfunction stemming from the two-party system.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of unaffiliated voters in Colorado and nationwide. I am one of them. As a former Republican, I felt like the party left me," Jonas said.</p>

<p>Jonas explained there are many reform efforts across Colorado and the country trying to redefine what elections are about.</p>
<blockquote>"Currently, the parties want us to believe that elections are about them. But, in a representative democracy, elections should be about voters." - Jim Jonas, Colorado resident and unaffiliated voter</blockquote>
<p>The actions of Colorado lawmakers this week showed that even when our representatives try to reform the system, they do it in a piecemeal fashion that still excludes unaffiliated voters. Hopefully, citizen-led efforts to make democracy more representative fare better.</p>
