<p>Senate Candidate&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.everettstern.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Everett Stern</a></strong>&nbsp;identifies an all-consuming sense of apathy as one of the major problems facing America today. Apathy and cynicism, he says, have robbed citizens of their hopes and dreams, and all but snuffed out the spirit of innovation that once helped this nation become a world leader. Having persevered through significant personal challenges, Stern sees a light in the darkness; reaching that light requires a re-investment in values like integrity, freedom, justice and truth.</p>

<p>"I believe the war against apathy is the most serious battle we face," argues Stern. "If we lose the war against apathy, then we will lose all the other wars we face. Hanging in the balance is everything we hold dear as Americans."</p>

<p>"Politics as usual" has become focused on one thing above nearly everything else – re-election. Incumbents wield tremendous power, and party machinery works hard to keep them seated. At the same time, politicians work in subtle ways to limit voter turnout, because low turnout benefits the status quo. During election cycles, Congresspersons receive hefty donations from corporations, which can sway their votes on a number of issues. The American people are on some level aware of all this maneuvering, and it feeds into the feeling that political participation is meaningless.</p>

<p>"The elevation of Donald Trump&nbsp;to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is a prime example of how political discourse has devolved," adds Stern. "Today, politics is too much about anger and mudslinging, with far too little substance. Trump's actual positions tend to be drowned out by his rhetoric. While his energy and irreverence certainly captivates some, most voters are just turned off and made cynical by the whole spectacle."</p>

<p>When Stern blew the whistle on international banking titan HSBC, he lost everything in the process – but he contends it was the right thing to do, and he would do it all over again. He might easily have thrown in the towel, but instead his commitment to restoring American values was only strengthened. This conviction to make personal sacrifices in the interest of the greater good is what's sorely lacking in politics today.</p>

<p>Facing off against Stern in the race for the <span>Pennsylvania</span> Senate seat is incumbent Republican <span>Pat Toomey</span>. From Stern's perspective, Toomey is representative of everything broken about the establishment. As a member of the Senate Bank Financing Committee, the Senator had the opportunity to send a strong message to HSBC and any other banks, but the committee failed to take any meaningful action. The fines levied on HSBC were a drop in the bucket relative to its revenue.</p>

<p>"I ask all Americans to join me in the fight against the most dangerous enemy we've ever faced," concludes Stern. "Together, we can defeat apathy and restore the values that actually matter.&nbsp;"</p>
