<p>Leaders of the Independent Party of Oregon and the Independence Party of Minnesota have reached a "broad strokes" agreement on joining together to form a national coalition of nonpartisan, moderate, and centrist third parties. The parties will convene a national conference or tele-conference this summer to discuss joint nomination of a candidate for president. The group has identified potential third-party partners in multiple states.</p>

<p>"The Democratic and Republican parties are poised to nominate candidates with the highest negative poll ratings in history," said Rob Harris, a Washington County attorney who was central to the talks between the two parties. "With the two parties nominating historically unpopular candidates, this is a conversation that is long overdue. We believe voters are ready for a change"</p>

<p>"We have been in a long decline in the civility of the nation's politics with a matching rise in negative partisanship," echoed State Chair Phil Fuehrer of the Independence Party of Minnesota. "This year's presidential spectacles have clearly shown it is time to discuss creating a better way."</p>

<p>IPO BACKGROUNDER</p>

<p>The Independent Party of Oregon (IPO) is a centrist-aligned ballot qualified political party with 104,000 members in the state of Oregon. In 2015, the party was recognized by the Secretary of State as a major political party by virtue of registering 5% of the state's total registered voters.</p>
