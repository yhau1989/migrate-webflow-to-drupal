<p>It is well&nbsp;documented in the media that the two anti-establishment candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have boosted interest and turnout in the 2016 primary election. Look for this trend to continue in California.</p>
<p>[button color="Danger" size="large" url="http://ivn.us/2016/05/13/donald-trump-tiene-confundido-al-partido-republicano-de-california/" text="Para leer el artículo en español, da click aquí"]</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s candidacy, in particular, may have a major impact in California’s 52nd Congressional District, where incumbent U.S. Rep. Scott Peters (D) is running against 5 Republicans in the nonpartisan, top-two primary.</p>

<p>Due to the near-perfect party division in the district -- one-third of registered voters are Democrats, one-third are Republicans, and one-third are independents -- the outcome of the June 7 primary will come down to who turns out to vote.</p>

<p>Just as he did in the <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/09/30/scott-peters-and-carl-demaio-vie-for-independents-cross-party-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 race</a>, Peters is once again working hard to appeal to independent voters, who will have a crucial say in who ends up winning the election. This has swayed the congressman to take up some policies&nbsp;that do not fall on traditional Democratic Party lines. This includes veterans' affairs and <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Chargers-Stadium-Signature-Gathering-Event-Philip-Rivers-LaDainian-Tomlinson-Roger-Goodell-376792471.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">his recent public support</a> for billionaire Chargers Chairman Dean Spanos.</p>

<p>Peters’ main opponents are also the most well-funded candidates on the Republican side: Denise Gitsham ($425,000 currently fundraised) and Jacquie Atkinson ($146,000 currently fundraised).</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Because of varying support for Trump, Republicans have their own intra-party issues to contend with." author=""]

<p>The Republican Party chose not to endorse any of the <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/may/03/democratic-rep-peters-five-gop-challengers-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOP candidates running</a> <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/may/03/democratic-rep-peters-five-gop-challengers-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer">before the primary</a>, leaving the candidates on their own to match Peters’ $2.2 million war chest. Both women likely hope the GOP will endorse them once through the primary.</p>

<p>With Trump’s campaign getting established in California, the focus turns to what impact the presumptive Republican presidential nominee will have in races both in terms of turnout and endorsements.</p>

<p>Denise Gitsham worked for the Bush-Cheney administration, under Karl Rove, as a Hispanic coordinator. She also shares her campaign manager, Jason Roe, with Republican San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who is up for re-election.</p>

<p>Faulconer has publicly stated that he will <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/may/06/mayor-kevin-faulconer-wont-endorse-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">not endorse Trump</a>. Gitsham, however, has not issued a statement on her support of Trump or any other presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Atkinson, a wounded Marine vet who is openly gay and was mentored by former City Councilman Carl DeMaio, stated in March that she would support Trump should he receive the nomination.</p>

<p>Because of varying support for Trump, Republicans have their own <a href="http://www.calbuzz.com/2016/05/how-trump-could-flip-republican-cds-in-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">intra-party issues</a> to contend with. Leaders of the GOP initially didn’t want their candidates affiliated with Trump in any way, though the party is beginning to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-ryan-plans-to-talk-with-donald-trump-on-how-to-unify-gop-1462909941" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about unifying around him</a>.</p>

<p>The 52nd congressional district will likely <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/primary-turnout-means-nothing-for-the-general-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">draw more voters</a> of its own accord due to it being one of the most competitive races in the country. Add a firebrand presidential candidate into the mix, and the fate of an incumbent congressman becomes even more uncertain.</p>
