<p><span>San Diego, CALIF. - More than one million mail-in ballots have been sent to voters of San Diego County. If confirmed by Registrar Michael Vu, that would represent a new record.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://data.inewsource.org/elections/san-diego-2016-general-early-voting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Inewsource has reported</span></a><span> that 1.11 million early ballots were issued. This means, of the </span><a href="http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/info/bythenumbers/rov.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>1.5 million San Diegans registered to vote</span></a><span>, 65% intend to vote by mail. &nbsp;So far, the Registrar has received 501,687 completed ballots. </span></p>

<p><span>A</span><span> plethora of mail-in ballots can be expected to roll in today.</span></p>

<p><span>Elections analyst Vince Vasquez told</span><a href="http://inewsource.org/2016/11/01/early-voting-san-diego-2016-general-election-ab/?utm_expid=78280858-9.nvNcP_bhQhqmdXwBWxPOLg.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span>inewsource</span></i></a><span> that, given the sheer length of the ballot this year, absentee voters likely spent a substantial amount of time studying the ballots before mailing them in. Additionally, Vasquez indicated that a number of absentee voters complete their ballots at home with the intention of dropping them off at polling booths on Election Day. </span></p>

<p><span>The number of mail-ballot voters was higher than that of precinct voters in 2012, and this year, even more San Diegans opted to vote by mail. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.countynewscenter.com/election-results-when-theyre-counted/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>850,000 early ballots</span></a><span> were issued in </span><span>2012,</span><a href="http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2012-general/03-voter-participation-stats-by-county.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>675,007 of them</span></a><span> were cast. </span></p>

<p><span>As for the 2016 General Election, of the 501,687 ballots received so far, 40% came from Democrats, 37% from Republicans, and 22% of the ballots from NPP.</span></p>
