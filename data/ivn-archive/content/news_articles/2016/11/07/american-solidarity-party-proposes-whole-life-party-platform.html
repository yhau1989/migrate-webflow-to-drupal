<p>Upon securing the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year, several <a href="http://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/3/1/11139054/trump-party-realignment" rel="noopener noreferrer">commentators</a> <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-election-realignment-partisan-political-party-policy-democrats-republicans-politics-213909" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that Donald Trump was realigning American politics. Through that realignment, economic nationalism, less intervention in foreign affairs, and restrictions on immigration could define the Republican Party.</p>

<p>If Trump loses the election, a key question will be whether his platform will continue in the Republican Party or elsewhere.</p>

<p>If somewhere else, one potential outlet for his supporters may be the American Solidarity Party (ASP).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-different-conservatism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formed</a> in 2011, the ASP models itself on the Christian Democratic parties of Europe. Compared to the more decidedly right-wing <a href="https://www.constitutionparty.com/our-principles/seven-principles/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constitution Party</a>, the American Solidarity Party appears more <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/religion/2016/10/06/american-solidarity-party-for-change/91666544/" rel="noopener noreferrer">centrist</a> in its political orientation. The party motto displays in big letters on its website: "Common Good. Common Sense. Common Ground."</p>

<p>The ASP adheres to traditional Roman Catholic teachings on abortion and marriage as part of its "<a href="http://cal-catholic.com/?p=25929" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole life party</a>" <a href="http://www.solidarity-party.org/complete-platform" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform</a>.</p>

<p>However, unlike <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/politics/donald-trump-immigration-speech/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump</a>, the ASP <a href="http://www.solidarity-party.org/immigration" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeks</a> "amnesty and a path to citizenship for aliens currently residing within our borders." The ASP also proposes a single-payer health care system. Rather than one administered from Washington, they support a system which is "<a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/88702-explainer-what-you-should-know-about-the-american-solidarity-party-platform.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">decentralized</a>."</p>

<p>The party this year nominated professional magician Mike Maturen for president after Amir Azarvan <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-different-conservatism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">withdrew</a>.</p>

<p>Maturen is hopeful that the ASP can eventually grow. He <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-different-conservatism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the American Conservative magazine earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote>"Mainstream America would be sort of center-right on social issues and sort of center-left on fiscal issues. . . . The problem is, they don’t know we exist."</blockquote>
<p>ASP media manager Christopher Keller notes the major parties fail the American people at large. The ASP could be an important voice. Earlier this year, he <a href="http://www.maderatribune.com/single-post/2016/08/06/New-party-boosted-by-election-frustrations" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"With the Republican Party, there’s been greater and greater departures from the interests of the average person, the middle class . . . . Yet on the Democratic side there’s been a detachment from social values."</blockquote>
<p>As with most minor parties, ballot access is a serious barrier for the ASP. <a href="http://www.solidarity-party.org/colorado-ballot-access" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colorado</a> is the only state where the party has official ballot access. However, the ASP has write-in status in several states. These <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmericanSolidarityParty/posts/730904537078692" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a> swing states such as Ohio, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The American Solidarity Party is looking beyond 2016 and hopes to convince people to vote according to their faith. Maturen <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/religion/2016/10/06/american-solidarity-party-for-change/91666544/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> in the Tennessean earlier this year, "As a Catholic, I truly believe that your actions in life are supposed to line up with your beliefs. . . . At some point, we have to try to start voting that way."</p>
