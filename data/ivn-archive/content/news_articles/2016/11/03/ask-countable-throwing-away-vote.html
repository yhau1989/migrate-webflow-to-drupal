<p>There’s just one week left until Election Day and with all the acrimony in the presidential race, we’ve heard from a lot of Countable users who are wondering about voting third party or not voting at all. Will voting third party or skipping it altogether hand the race to a major-party candidate you disagree with? Is a third party vote a wasted vote? Let’s break it down.</p>

<p>First, it really depends on how you think of your vote: Do you view it as solely a personal expression and action or is it more about results?</p>
<h3><strong>Not Voting</strong></h3>
<p>Ok, so you’re frustrated, we get that. There are a lot of reasons to want to make your voice heard and silence can be a valid option as well. If you don’t want to vote because you think it’d be morally compromising, that’s one thing. If you see not voting as a protest, that’s quite another.</p>

<p>Consider this: A <em>lot</em> of Americans don’t vote. In the last presidential election, just 62 percent of American citizens over 18 years of age voted and 71 percent were registered to vote, according to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2012/tables.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. In non-presidential election years, the numbers are much worse. According to the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center</a>, those stats have remained relatively stable for the last few decades and they’re pretty embarrassing when compared to voting data in other developed nations.</p>

<p>And yet, when Americans don’t vote, the response is rarely, "We should have had better candidates or a better system because so many Americans can’t bring themselves to vote." It’s typically much more like this:</p>

<p>As writer Clay Shirky wrote on Medium earlier this year: "In Presidential elections, non-voters always outnumber voters who choose the winning candidate." And yet, the desires of the non-voters and their reasons for not voting are almost never taken into consideration by the new president, controlling party of Congress, school board member, student body president, etc."</p>
