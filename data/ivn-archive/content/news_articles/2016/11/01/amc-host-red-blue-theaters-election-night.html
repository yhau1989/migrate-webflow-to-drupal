<p>AMC Theaters just announced that they will open their theaters for election coverage, an innovative and great idea.</p>

<p>I can also appreciate their decision to designate separate screens for "Red" fans and "Blue" fans. However, that decision underlines the partisanship that is responsible for an increasingly dysfunctional democracy.</p>

<p>Putting aside the obvious failure to include an option for Libertarian, Greens, or a third of Americans who choose not to affiliate with a party, those of us more concerned about our ability to unify after the election might prefer an option to start that process on Election Day.</p>

<p>How about a third choice for those of us who believe that politics should not be a blood sport? A place where folks who disagree with each other can share the transition from campaign time to a more respectful post-election unity.</p>

<p>How about it AMC? An IVN Unity Screen at every theater. Give Americans a chance to tell our politicians that, contrary to the partisan press, we are far less divided than they are.</p>
