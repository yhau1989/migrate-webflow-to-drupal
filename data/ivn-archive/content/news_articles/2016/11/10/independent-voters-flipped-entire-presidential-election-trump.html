<p>Media pundits, shellshocked by <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>'s victory, will likely spend days trying to dissect&nbsp;the presidential outcome to figure out how their predictions and election models turned out so wrong.&nbsp;While they will continue to talk about "white males" and the impact Libertarian presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a> had on the race, take a look at the following raw data from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania exit polls:</p>

<p>According to the exit polls in all three states, Clinton and Trump have near identical numbers in terms of the percent of their own party's voters casting a ballot for them (i.e. it doesn't appear "white males" from the Democratic Party jumped to Trump).&nbsp;Where Trump's margins&nbsp;came from is&nbsp;with registered independent voters, and no one in the media is talking about this.</p>

<p>IVN <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/11/07/independent-voter-surge-result-election-day-surprise/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Monday</a> that a surge in independent voters in key battleground states was upending the election models that&nbsp;under-sample or completely ignore these voters. Whatever news&nbsp;coverage there was mentioning&nbsp;this surge dismissed it as mostly a side note and <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/11/09/modern-polling-died-last-night-good/" rel="noopener noreferrer">all election models</a> touted by online media, cable news, Nate Silver, Moody's Analytics, leading up to election night all had Clinton winning and often winning by an electoral landslide.</p>

<p>No one in the media saw this coming because they overlooked&nbsp;the voters that are consistently ignored at every institutional level of our political system, from taxpayer-funded primary elections they have limited or no choice in (Pennsylvania, for instance, has&nbsp;closed presidential primaries) to two-sided media coverage.</p>

<p>"This election was determined by all those voters who the parties excluded from the primary process and therefore didnâ€™t have a vested interest in either candidate until the general election," said Dan Howle, co-chair of the Independent Voter Project (a co-publisher of IVN.us).</p>

<p>In Wisconsin&nbsp;and Michigan,&nbsp;registered independents accounted for approximately&nbsp;one-third of the vote. They may overtake both parties in the next election. With the supposed "data advantage" the Clinton camp had, it is surprising -- baffling really -- that they didn't understand this demographic, because Hillary didn't make many stops in any of these&nbsp;supposedly "safe blue" states.</p>

<p>Political&nbsp;pundits and commentators on CNN scratched their heads at why Trump was making so many appearances in states they claimed he had no shot at&nbsp;winning. Yet with&nbsp;all of the election data CNN had at its disposal,&nbsp;they couldn't put the pieces together as to what Trump's strategy was. They scoffed at Trump for making stops in Michigan and Wisconsin. Today they are stunned.</p>

<p>Looking at these three states, many of the independent voters that showed up at the polls are likely blue-collar workers, who have watched manufacturing jobs leave their towns and cities in droves. They are middle-income men and women who have watched their health care premiums skyrocket, regardless of health care subsidies that some of them may not even qualify for. They are looking at a political system that has ignored them at every institutional level for decades.</p>

<p>When offered a choice between more of the same and something new, the answer was clear for a majority of these voters.</p>

<p>As one pundit put it, when you go to the gift shop at the airport there are two shirts. Trump's says, "Make America Great Again." Hillary's says, "Hillary."</p>

<p>Knowing this, are we really surprised that Trump won the 2016 presidential election?</p>
