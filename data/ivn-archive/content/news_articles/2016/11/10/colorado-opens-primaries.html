<p><span><strong>San Diego, CALIF.</strong> - </span><span>As the haze from the presidential election dissipates, many Americans are reflecting on the electoral process itself. And for the first time in a long time, the nation seems to have reached an agreement: flaws in the system must be addressed.</span></p>

<p><span>The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</span><a href="http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/HTML%20Reports/the-frustrated-public-americans-views-of-the-election-issue-brief.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>reports</span></a><span> that, despite a typically divided electorate, “there are few partisan differences in the public’s lack of faith in the political parties, the nominating process, and the branches of government.”</span></p>

<p><span>Primary reform has been a hotly deliberated topic since early 2016, when </span><span>millions of independent voters (</span><span>half of which are </span><a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>millennials</span></a><span>) </span><span>simply weren’t allowed to participate in the presidential primaries.</span><span> Similarly, registered Democrats and Republicans were unable to vote for a preferred candidate outside their respective parties.</span></p>

<p><span>Colorado spearheaded efforts to challenge the two-party control of elections with Propositions 107 and 108, which allow independent voters to participate in partisan primaries. On Tuesday, voters passed the two initiatives, finally giving a voice to the state’s 1.3 million unaffiliated voters. Prop 107 concerns the presidential primary, and Prop 108 addresses state and federal party primaries, like governor or U.S. senator.</span></p>

<p><span>While a majority of voters from each party say they favor open primaries and caucuses, </span><span>some elected officials worry about people disaffiliating for the sole purpose of negatively influencing the primaries. A party-affiliated voter could intentionally pick a weaker candidate for the opposing party, for instance.</span></p>

<p><span>According to Open Primaries, a nonprofit organization that advocates for open nonpartisan primary systems, primary reform is focused on equal participation and voter empowerment – not party advantage. Open Primaries Senior VP Jeremy Gruber said in a</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161109006146/en/Colorado-Vote-Passes-Primary-Reform-Initiatives-Vote" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>press release</span></a><span> Wednesday, “</span><span>Americans are angry and tired of the kind of establishment politics that divides us up between the political parties. We need a new way forward, and that starts by bringing thoughtful Republicans, Democrats and independents together to reclaim our democracy for ALL the people.” </span></p>

<p><span>With a</span><a href="http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/HTML%20Reports/the-frustrated-public-americans-views-of-the-election-issue-brief.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>reported</span></a><span> 9 in 10 Americans lacking confidence in the country's political system, much of the country hopes to see changes in the process moving forward.</span></p>
