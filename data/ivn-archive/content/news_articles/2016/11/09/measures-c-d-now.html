<p><span>San Diego, CALIF. - Two of the most highly contested local ballot measures in the City of San Diego were defeated last night, as the voters of San Diego declined to pass Measures C and D.</span></p>

<p><span>With 43% voting YES and 57% voting NO, Measure C (the Chargers’ Initiative) fell far short of the 2/3 majority needed to pass. Measure D required a simple majority and &nbsp;managed to receive 40% of YES votes.</span></p>

<p><span>A large number of provisional ballots still need to be counted, and while the numbers will likely fluctuate a bit, the outcomes are not expected to change. </span></p>

<p><span>What no on Measures C and D mean:</span></p>
<ul>
 	<li><span>No downtown football stadium</span></li>
 	<li><span>No increased hotel-room (TOT) tax</span></li>
 	<li><span>No approval for Qualcomm Stadium site to be sold for educational or park use</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The cornerstone tenet of Measure D (and by far, the most popular component of either measure) was the development of the Qualcomm Stadium site for parkland and higher education use. Supporters of Measure D say they are still pursuing that goal </span><span>–</span><span> although in what form is not yet known </span><span>–</span><span> but clearly, the public has a desire to make sure the Qualcomm Stadium site is used in the capacity Measure D envisioned.</span></p>

<p><span>Now to Measure C and the Chargers. What happens next? </span></p>

<p><span>Chargers owner Dean Spanos has been outspoken in his reluctance to remain in Mission Valley. </span><span>Spanos released a</span><a href="http://www.chargers.com/news/2016/11/09/letter-dean-spanos-chargers-fans" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>statement</span></a><span> last night indicating that a decision would not be made until after the season ends. “In terms of what comes next for the Chargers, it’s just too early to give you an answer,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span>The team could opt to tear down Qualcomm and build a new stadium in its place, but it’s unlikely given </span><span>Spanos’</span><a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/06/03/chargers-wont-be-pivoting-back-to-mission-valley-site/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>announcement</span></a><span> earlier this year that the team has no intention of staying in Mission Valley.</span></p>

<p><span>A rewrite for Measure C is possible for 2017. </span><span>Haney Hong of the San Diego County Taxpayer's Association was quoted recently saying, "I think that folks would love the Chargers to stay but I think they want to make sure it’s done in a deal that's fair to taxpayers.” &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Taking what they learned from the election defeat, the Chargers could craft a stadium solution more likely to receive voter support.</span></p>

<p><span>The Chargers also have the option of becoming a tenant in the Rams’ new stadium in Los Angeles. The team has until January 15, 2017 to decide.</span></p>
