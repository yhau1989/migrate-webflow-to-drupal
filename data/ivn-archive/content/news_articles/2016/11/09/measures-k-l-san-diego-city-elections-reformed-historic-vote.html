<p><span>San Diego, CALIF.-Democracy is best served when the most voters are participating. That was the signature tenet of Measures K and L and it rang true with wins for the two measures that will amend the City Charter of San Diego.</span></p>

<p><span>Measure K won with 58% of the vote. Measure L won with 65% of the vote.</span></p>

<p><span>Written by the Independent Voter Project, </span><span>Measure K will align San Diego with the State of California’s election rules, using the same nonpartisan top-two runoff process to elect our mayor, city attorney and council members as we use to elect the Governor, state legislators, and members of Congress.</span></p>

<p><span>Chad Peace, attorney with the Independent Voter Project, and author of Measure K said, “Quietly, San Diego did something quite important. Measure K will not necessarily change who will get elected in the future. But it will ensure that our leaders are accountable to everyone.”</span></p>

<p><span>And, drafted by Alliance San Diego, Measure L will ensure that citizen initiatives and referendums are voted on only in the November general election, when the most voters participate.</span></p>

<p><span>Unlike state and federal offices, a local 50%+1 election loophole allowed special interests to elect their candidates when fewer voters were involved in the decision-making process. In San Diego’s last 36 elections, 19 were decided in the June primary, when turnout is often half of what it is in the November General Election.</span></p>

<p><span>Voters rationally assume the races are actually being decided in the general election. Measure K will eliminate the confusion and that loophole.</span></p>

<p><span>For the same reason, Measure L amends the Charter to require all local ballot measures to appear on the November ballot instead of the June primary ballot.</span></p>
