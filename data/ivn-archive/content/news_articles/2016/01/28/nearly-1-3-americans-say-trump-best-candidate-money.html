<p><strong><span>LOS ANGELES</span>, <span>Jan. 27, 2016</span> /PRNewswire/</strong> --&nbsp;In anticipation of the upcoming presidential primaries for the 2016 presidential election, leading personal finance website GOBankingRates.com surveyed nearly 8,000 Americans to find out which candidate they think will be best for their money.&nbsp; Although Donald Trump was the top pick overall from those surveyed, nearly 50 percent of millennials ages 18 to 24 said <span>Bernie Sanders'</span> policies would be best for them financially.</p>

<p>The survey posed the question, "Which presidential candidate would be best for you financially?" and is representative of the U.S. online population with a margin of error of 3 percent.</p>

<p><b>Respondents' Answer Choices:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Donald Trump</span> — 29%</li>
	<li><span>Bernie Sanders</span> — 26%</li>
	<li><span>Hillary Clinton</span> — 20%</li>
	<li><span>Ted Cruz</span> — 9%</li>
	<li><span>Marco Rubio</span> — 8%</li>
	<li><span>Ben Carson</span> — 8%</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those surveyed, 37 percent of the respondents answered "none of the above," indicating that their favorite candidate was not listed or that they had not yet decided. The percentages listed above were taken from the remaining population of respondents.</p>

<p>"The economy is growing, but many Americans are still dissatisfied with slow-growing wages, high taxes or other fiscal policies that affect their bank accounts," said <span>Elyssa Kirkham</span>, the GOBankingRates finance writer on the study.</p>

<p>"In the 2016 election, voters should be looking for a candidate who can help them build greater financial security as individuals, families and communities," Kirkham said. "But opinions on the best way to do this are very divided, and this survey shows that many candidates are offering solutions that voters find favorable."</p>

<p><b>Additional Findings:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>49 percent of millennial voters (ages 18 to 24) say that Sanders would be best for them financially, most likely because he supports free college and a <span>$15</span> minimum wage.</li>
	<li>Two-thirds of adults age 65 and older chose either Clinton or Trump as the candidate who would be best for them financially. Those two candidates have said they won't cut Social Security.</li>
	<li>For fiscal policy, women favor Democrats, whereas men favor Republicans.</li>
