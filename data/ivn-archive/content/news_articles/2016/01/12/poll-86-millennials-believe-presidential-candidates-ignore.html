<p><strong><span>NEW YORK</span>, Jan.12, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> --&nbsp;The vast majority of recent college graduates believe that the current presidential candidates are not talking about the issues that matter most to them, according to a new <a href="http://www.genfkd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GenFKD-Millennial-Sentiment-Survey.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> of millennials by <a href="http://www.genfkd.com/genfkd-survey-finds-that-presidential-candidates-ignore-millennials" rel="noopener noreferrer">GenFKD</a>, a non-partisan organization dedicated to promoting economic understanding and financial literacy to college students and recent graduates.</p>

<p>Millennials account <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2013/10/29/2849201/democrats-2016-white-working-class/" rel="noopener noreferrer">for 36 percent of eligible voters</a>, the largest demographic in the 2016 election, according to ThinkProgress.&nbsp; Despite their voting power, 86 percent of those 18 to 34 say this year's presidential candidates are not addressing them or their key issues they care most about.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jobs and economic growth (19%)</li>
	<li>Climate change (14%)</li>
	<li>Health Care (11%)</li>
	<li>Student Debt (10%)</li>
</ul>
<p>"It is very disappointing that the presidential candidates are ignoring a vital demographic group and the issues that matter most to millennials," said <span>Justin Dent</span>, president and co-founder of GenFKD. "With an uncertain economy and international instability, millennials are more engaged than ever in the upcoming election, yet they are left out of the discussion."</p>

<p>GenFKD polled 752 millennials through <a href="http://www.genfkd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GenFKD-Millennial-Sentiment-Survey.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survey Monkey</a> to determine which issues most concern them and if they felt their concerns were being adequately acknowledged in the national debate.</p>

<p>"Millennials are clearly concerned about the economy they will inherit, and the opportunities available to them," said <span>Christopher Koopman</span> of <a href="http://mercatus.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Mercatus Institute</a> at George Mason University. &nbsp;"Unfortunately, political candidates have a strong incentive to support special interests over the causes that matter most to young people. There is a danger in doing that because millennials are concerned, active, and engaged."</p>

<p>"Until now, there have been less than a handful <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/260526-millennial-unemployment-the-crisis-the-candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer">of millennial issues</a> addressed in hours and hours of debates and interviews," said Dent, a student at the <span>University of Maryland</span>. "We're worried about jobs and graduating into a nation of the underemployed."</p>
