<blockquote><em>[The President] shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.</em> -- Article II, Section 3 U.S. Constitution</blockquote>
<p>George Washington set the precedent that the president should deliver a speech to both houses of Congress annually, yet history also shows a rich and varied approach to the SOTU -- a time honored tradition that really isn't set into stone.</p>

<p>Of course, the Constitution requires the president to inform Congress of the 'state of the union,' but does not set the timing, how it is done, and/or where or not&nbsp;it is directed to the&nbsp;houses simultaneously.</p>

<p>In many ways, this was a face saving technique employed by Washington. Discouraged by the Congress not gladly supporting his proposals, Washington (and other presidents since) refrained from going to Congress in person to make requests--and yet the SOTU gave Washington a platform to both request his agenda and <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29431" rel="noopener noreferrer">chide the houses of Congress into action</a>.</p>

<p>For the president, the SOTU quickly became an important part of their policy arsenal, giving them a chance to have an uninterrupted opportunity to make their political case.</p>

<p>John Adams continued Washington's tradition, holding the SOTU annually before both houses.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Jimmy Carter was the last POTUS to send a written report to Congress in lieu of a SOTU address." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295672614" handle="yee_ivn" hashes=""]Jefferson, however, likened&nbsp;"it to a 'speech from the throne' reminiscent of monarchyâ€™s vestiges," and instead opted to send a <p><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40132.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">written report to Congress</a>.</p>

<p>This practice continued until 1913, with many SOTU reports exceeding 25,000 words (the size of a small book).</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson changed this, stunning the power brokers in Washington by restarting the practice of addressing both houses. He used it, successfully, as a political tool to gain support for his agenda and to maintain a semblance of control over congressional policy.</p>

<p>All presidents since Wilson, except Hoover, have delivered at least one address to a joint session of Congress.</p>

<p>Some 20th century presidents chose to occasionally send written reports instead of addressing congress, although Jimmy Carter was the last to do this in 1981.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, there is no real requirement for Congress to invite the president to deliver a joint address--other than the political fallout and finger-pointing that would ensue if they 'dis-invited' the president.</p>

<p>In modern times, with the advancement in media formats, a 'dis-invite' would almost certainly serve to further the president's agenda far more than that of Congress.</p>

<p>In the Washington time-honored tradition of piling your opponents under rhetoric, a long written report might actually serve the president better than an hour-long address. In that way, the president fully outlays the agenda, placing Congress on the rhetorical defensive.</p>

<p>In a sharply divided Congress like today's, a 'dis-invite' would only serve to placate the hardcore party members.Therefore,&nbsp;such a decision&nbsp;would almost certainly alienate and offend many voters; especially those already '<a href="http://ivn.us/2016/01/11/gallup-major-party-identification-lingers-near-historic-lows/" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned-off</a>' by the party antics and power jockeying.</p>

<p>Gaining political points with the base at the expense of alienating the broader, more politically diverse electorate&nbsp;is foolish, but sometimes foolishness still finds itself into political maneuvering.</p>
