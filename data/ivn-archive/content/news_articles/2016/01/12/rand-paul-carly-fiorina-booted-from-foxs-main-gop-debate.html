[gravityform id="98" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]Fox News released its lineup for Thursday’s GOP debate on Monday night, announcing that the stage will hold seven candidates, cutting Kentucky Sen. <p><a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a> and former Hewlett-Packard CEO <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/carly-fiorina" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carly Fiorina</a> from the lineup.</p>

<p>In preparation for the primetime debate, which will air at 9 p.m. ET, Fox Business Network reportedly <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/rand-paul-carly-fiorina-cut-main-gop-debate-000313217--election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">selected</a> its lineup based off of the top six candidates in the five most recent national polls, as well as any candidates polling in the top five in either Iowa or New Hampshire.</p>

<p>The main stage will feature the smallest GOP lineup thus far, and will include real estate mogul Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.</p>

<p>As a consolation, Paul and Fiorina have been invited to participate in the “<em>undercard</em>” debate, which airs at 6 p.m. ET Thursday. The other GOP candidates participating in the debate are former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.</p>

<p>Paul <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/politics/rand-paul-fox-debate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that because he has been excluded from the main stage, he plans to boycott the debate altogether. <em>“I won’t participate in anything that’s not first tier because we have a first tier campaign,”&nbsp;</em>he explained.</p>

<p>Paul then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/11/rand-paul-bumped-from-main-debate-stage-will-boycott-thursdays-undercard/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the Washington Post that he has resolved&nbsp;to <em>“take the debate to Iowa and New Hampshire”</em> instead.</p>

<p><em>“I think they’ve made a mistake,”</em> Paul said.<em>“I’m not willing to accept a designation as a minor campaign. We’ve raised $25 million. We’ve gotten on the ballot [in]&nbsp;every state. It’s kind of ridiculous to arbitrarily rate the campaigns based on national polling.”</em></p>

<p>Fiorina faced off on the undercard stage during the first GOP debate, and was then moved to the main stage after CNN <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/cnn-amends-criteria-gop-debate-lineup/" rel="noopener noreferrer">amended</a> its rules for the lineup.</p>

<p>Responding to the news on Monday night, Fiorina <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/01/11/nightside-carly-fiorina-checks-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;CBS Radio Boston’s Dan Rea Show that according to the poll used by Fox News, she should be qualified, but that she will still debate “<em>anyone, anytime, anywhere.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Well, you know, these polls are all over the map,”</em> Fiorina said.&nbsp;<em>“In the Fox News poll, I’m in sixth&nbsp;place, which would qualify me, but hey, I’ll debate anyone, anytime, anywhere. I’ll be in South Carolina and what I know is that polls don’t win elections, voters do.”</em></p>
