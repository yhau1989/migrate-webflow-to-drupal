<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/sell-everything-ahead-of-stock-market-crash-say-rbs-economists" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Bank of Scotland's economists</a> warned investors last week to "sell everything" other than high quality bonds, citing Chinese instability and continued suppression of oil prices.</p>

<p>With January's huge slump in the stock markets, it's looking like there's the significant possibility of a long-term bear market.</p>

<p>IVN has been way ahead of the news cycle, reporting on the <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/07/23/chinas-gold-dump-greatest-financial-bubble-human-history-may-soon-burst/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese economic crises</a> since last year, as well as questioning the benefit of long-term suppressed <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/19/american-jobs-banking-industry-will-unusually-low-oil-prices-hurt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">oil prices</a> on the American economy.</p>

<p>All of this comes at a time when Americans as a whole have less than <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/11/02/most-americans-have-less-than-1k-but-wait-it-gets-worse/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,000 in tangible cash assets</a>, coupled with mounting debt loads.</p>

<p>Trouble is brewing not only in the financial sectors, but in the agricultural and consumer markets as well.</p>

<p>In the $1.4 trillion American food budget, staple foods like <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-prices-and-spending.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">beef and eggs</a> are well over 10 percent higher than last year.</p>

<p>The consumer markets are being hit hard as well, with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/list-of-walmart-stores-closing-2016-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart,</a> the world's largest civilian employer, announcing the closure of 269 stores and laying off over 16,000 workers.</p>

<p>It's the perfect storm for the American economy, but it could be even worse politically -- at least for the incumbent party.</p>

<p>Voters tend to have incredibly short memories at election time when it comes to the economy, and somebody is undoubtedly going to be blamed.</p>

<p>A party keeping the White House for more than 8 years has been tough in modern elections, but under potential economic chaos it will be almost impossible.</p>

<p>Politicians love to take credit for a bull market, but voters equally punish them for economic slumps, regardless of the real impact that American politicians have on the world economy.</p>

<p>And this is where voters really need a reality check, and a firm understanding of how globalization has changed the economics of the world forever.</p>

<p>But in the end, a bad economy for 2016 could give the Republicans the White House and both chambers of Congress by employing Bill Clinton's strategy of "it's the economy, stupid."</p>
