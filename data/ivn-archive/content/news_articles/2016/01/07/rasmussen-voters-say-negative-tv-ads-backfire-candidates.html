<p>Rasmussen Reports released the results of a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2016/most_say_negative_tv_ads_backfire_on_candidates_who_use_them" rel="noopener noreferrer">new survey</a> Thursday that&nbsp;found that a majority of respondents&nbsp;(56%) say they are less likely to vote for a candidate who uses negative attack ads against his or her election rival(s). Further, 60 percent see a major disparity between TV ads that attack opposing candidates&nbsp;than promote the candidacy of the person running for office.</p>

<p>The results of the survey have remained relatively unchanged over the last few years. Overall, 55 percent of respondents believe it is possible for a candidate to win an election without going negative, while only 30 percent disagree. Only 10 percent of respondents say negative campaign ads increase the likelihood that they will vote for a&nbsp;candidate, while 29 percent say negative ads do not affect their voting behavior at all.</p>

<p>Other findings worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rasmussen reports that the number of Americans who believe that a candidate can win without going negative has run as high as 64% in 2010.</li>
	<li>58% of respondents&nbsp;say they pay close attention to political advertisements running on television; only 19 percent said they follow them "Very Closely."</li>
	<li>41% are not paying close attention to these ads.</li>
	<li>22% think most political ads promote the candidate who is paying for it;&nbsp;18% are undecided.</li>
</ul>
<p>The poll itself seemed to focus specifically on ads that come from campaigns rather than ads that might be paid for by a political action committee in favor or in opposition of a candidate. Therefore, it is unclear whether or not many of these voters might associate an attack ad from a Super PAC with the campaign of a candidate that PAC supports or can discern who is actually paying for the ad.</p>
