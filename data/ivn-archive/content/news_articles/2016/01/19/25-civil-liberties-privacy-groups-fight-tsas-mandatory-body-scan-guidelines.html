<p>On January 13, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisabrownlee/2016/01/14/growing-list-joins-tsa-body-scan-fight/#2715e4857a0b3820c28e6919" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a letter</a> to the&nbsp;Transportation Security&nbsp;Administration and lawmakers regarding the TSA’s recent&nbsp;decision to make airport body scans a mandatory procedure.</p>

<p>The coalition, which includes&nbsp;the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF),&nbsp;the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and&nbsp;anti-biometrics group, the Constitutional Alliance,&nbsp;said they were writing to Congress&nbsp;<em>“regarding the TSA’s recent claim that it can mandate whole body scanning for airline passengers.”</em></p>

<p>In December 2015, it was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisabrownlee/2015/12/24/tsa-body-scan-just-say-no-leading-expert-says/#2715e4857a0b45797a77789a" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported </a>that the TSA was changing its procedures without notice, making full body scans mandatory for some passengers. Prior to this point, passengers could choose to opt out of the full-body scan machines and undergo a pat-down instead.&nbsp;The new procedures will allow&nbsp;the TSA&nbsp;to select passengers for mandatory body scans.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://privacycoalition.org/TSA-Congressional-Oversight-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter states</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>“We are representative of leading civil liberties, human rights, and non-profit organizations, across the political spectrum. Many of us previously petitioned the DHS Secretary to conduct a public rulemaking on the use of airport body scanners after the agency sua sponte decided to make a pilot project into a national program of electronically strip searching airline travelers.”</em></blockquote>
<p>The letter states that in the lawsuit <em>EPIC v. DHS,</em> a federal appeals court ruled that the TSA failed to conduct a public rulemaking as required by the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

<p>The same court also found that the body scans were not a&nbsp;Fourth Amendment violation because <em>“any passenger may opt-out of AIT screening in favor of a patdown, which allows him to decide which of the two options for detecting a concealed, nonmetallic weapon or explosive is least invasive.”</em> With the new rule changes, that option is no longer available for all passengers.</p>

<p>The coalition called for public hearings to study the TSA’s conduct as well as&nbsp;a temporary hold on full-body scanner funding and increased&nbsp;oversight of the TSA. The letter also demands the TSA be required to publish all de facto regulations,&nbsp;be required to evaluate the cost of screening procedures using whole body scanners, and calls for several changes to regulations to make sure any orders from the TSA are subject to judicial review as are other government actions.</p>

<p>The letter was sent to&nbsp;Representative Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, and Representative Elijah Cummings, Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</p>
