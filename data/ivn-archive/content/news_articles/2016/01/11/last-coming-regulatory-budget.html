<p><strong><span>WASHINGTON</span>, <span>Jan. 10, 2016</span> /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> -- <span>Washington</span> is abound with proposals to "regulate the regulators," namely placing procedural constraints on the writing of regulations.</p>

<p>However basic structural changes in the regulatory system which would obviate the need for many of these procedural requirements by instituting new institutional changes in the regulate state are rare.</p>

<p>The most significant institutional feature of the regulatory state is the establishment of <a href="http://www.thecre.com/pdf/20111211_ALR_Tozzi_Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">centralized regulatory review</a> in the White House Office of Management and Budget.</p>

<p>The second most significant feature of the regulatory state is the forthcoming implementation of a <a href="http://www.regblog.org/2016/01/08/tozzi-regulatory-budget/" rel="noopener noreferrer">regulatory budget.</a> A regulatory budget establishes a cap on the total cost regulators can impose upon the public.</p>

<p>What is needed now is for the public to demand that the process be jump started by:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the Congress initiating a deliberative process on regulatory budgets&nbsp;by introducing legislation&nbsp; once proposed by the then Senator&nbsp;Bentsen( D-<span>Texas</span>) titled <i>The Regulatory Budget Act of 1979 </i>( S. 51 96th Congress 1st Sess 1979) and</li>
	<li>the Administration&nbsp;seeking public comment on mechanisms that can be used to implement a regulatory budget based upon existing law with full consideration of the experiences gained from a <a href="http://www.thecre.com/ombpapers/regbudget.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparable</a> effort made by the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/ombpapers/RegCostAccounting1980.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carter Administration.</a></li>
</ol>
