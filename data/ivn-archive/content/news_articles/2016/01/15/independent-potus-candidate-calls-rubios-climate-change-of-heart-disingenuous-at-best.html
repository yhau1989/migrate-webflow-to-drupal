<p><strong><span>NEW YORK</span>, <span>Jan. 15, 2016</span> /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> -- In response to <span>Marco Rubio's</span> recent campaign event in <span>New Hampshire</span> where the candidate appears to have made a climate change of heart and has called for America to be "number one in wind, and number one in solar, and number one in biofuels, and number one in renewables, number one in energy efficiency. Let's lead in all of these things," independent presidential candidate <span>Ken Fields</span> responded by saying:</p>

<p>"For someone who has so vehemently opposed any acknowledgement of the scientific consensus backing the evidence of human-caused climate change due to our planet's reliance on fossil fuels, Rubio's change of heart seems disingenuous at best. He has voted against energy efficiency and clean energy tax incentives. It's hard to believe him."</p>

<p>When pressed for further comment, Fields stated, "The recent and continued volatility in global oil markets should be evidence enough that energy security is not simply a matter of having and exploiting our own fossil fuel resources, but rather being completely independent of fossil fuels altogether."</p>

<p>Fields officially launched his campaign last week on January 8,&nbsp;2016. His platform revolves around his slogan, "Greatness Must Be Earned" and to do great things, he has advocated the transition to 100% renewable energy for the country over the next 20 years. His policy plan includes, but is not limited to, creating the public and private mechanisms to encourage and nurture the financial markets to participate, a tax holiday for repatriated corporate capital that is invested in renewables and a carbon tax and dividend plan.</p>
