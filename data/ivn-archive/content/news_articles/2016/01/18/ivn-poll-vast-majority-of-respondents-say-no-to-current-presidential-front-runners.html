<p>Many voters are not satisfied with the two major-party candidates deemed as the front-runners in the 2016 presidential election. That is the finding of a poll conducted by IVN News, in which 73% of respondents said that when given the option of choosing <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong>, or <strong>Other</strong>, they want an alternative option over Clinton and Trump.</p>

<p>The results&nbsp;reflect what seems to be the general attitude of the public: many voters feel disenfranchised&nbsp;in the current electoral system, are tired of the media deciding for them who are the most viable candidates, and are not represented by traditional horse-race polling, which doesn't account for&nbsp;broad frustrations with the two-party system.</p>

<p>If the election were held today,&nbsp;nearly three-quarters of respondents said they would want to vote&nbsp;for someone other than the current front-runners for the Republican and Democratic parties. Trump came in second at 20 percent, while only 7 percent of respondents said they would vote for Clinton.</p>

<p>An overwhelming 81 percent of respondents who replied&nbsp;"Other" said they would vote for <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong>. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a></strong> came in second at 6 percent, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gary-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Johnson</a></strong> garnered 4 percent, and 2&nbsp;percent said&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a></strong>.</p>

<p>When asked which party best represents their views, 33 percent said the Democratic Party, 27 percent said none of the parties represent their views, and 13 percent said the Republican Party. Further, 10 percent said they believe the Libertarian Party best represents their views, while 9 percent said Other&nbsp;and 8 percent said Green.</p>

<p>The poll, which&nbsp;ran from January 9 to January 15, amassed over 16,600 responses. In full disclosure, the poll specifically targeted the IVN audience and&nbsp;is not a proportional sampling of the U.S. population.</p>
