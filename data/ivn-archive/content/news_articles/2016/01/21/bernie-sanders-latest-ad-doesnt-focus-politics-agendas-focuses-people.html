<p>Bernie Sanders may have released his most effective campaign ad to date, certainly one that will have people talking going into the February 1 Iowa Caucuses.</p>

<p>No words are spoken, except for the lyrics of Simon and Garfunkel's <em>America</em>, and the required authority line at the end, "I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message."&nbsp;There is no condemnation of the billionaire class or big banks or campaign promises that can be taken with a grain of salt. The focus of the ad is&nbsp;on people -- people who have been won over by the independent U.S. senator from Vermont and the energy present on the ground, at his campaign rallies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pivotal moment in the ad is when it crescendos at the lyrics, "They've all come to look for America," and the image expands to a grid of hundreds of&nbsp;voters who have come out to see Sanders. Sanders' campaign has thus far been grassroots-driven, and the ad highlights that. There is an enthusiasm&nbsp;on the ground, from thousands upon thousands of American voters -- working-class people from average American households -- that is only rivaled now by Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Sanders campaign says the ads will start airing Friday in Iowa and New Hampshire. The Real Clear Politics polling average shows Bernie Sanders gaining on Clinton <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-3195.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Iowa</a>, but he is still behind by approximately 5 points. New Hampshire is <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">another story</a>, where Sanders has a RCP spread of 12.6 points. The latest CNN/WMUR poll shows him leading 60-33, and he is on top in all 5 polls used in the RCP average.</p>
