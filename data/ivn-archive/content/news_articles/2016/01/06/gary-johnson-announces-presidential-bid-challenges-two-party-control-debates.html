<p>Former governor of New Mexico and 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee for president, Gary Johnson, announced his candidacy for president Wednesday. Johnson made the announcement via&nbsp;<a href="http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4688066622001/fmr-gov-gary-johnson-im-running-for-president-/?playlist_id=933116635001#sp=show-clips" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Cavuto's show</a> on Fox Business, saying,&nbsp;"I'm hoping to get the Libertarian nomination for president in 2016."</p>

<p>During his announcement, Johnson highlighted his platform priorities, which include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reducing the $20 trillion national debt;</li>
	<li>Increasing personal freedom;</li>
	<li>Reducing the size and scope of government;</li>
	<li>Being fiscally conservative and socially liberal; and</li>
	<li>Protecting the freedom of religion while cutting off funding for the politics of Sharia law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Johnson has been very vocal about the lack of competition in the presidential election process. He's <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/08/03/gary-johnson-one-debate-rule-getting-way-real-choice-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously argued</a> that the Commission on Presidential Debates has purposely written the rules to exclude all candidates who are neither&nbsp;Republican nor Democrat:</p>
<blockquote>"We've sued the Presidential Debate Commission" said Johnson during his announcement. "The notion&nbsp;that if you're on the ballot in enough states to mathematically be elected president [then]&nbsp;you should be included in the presidential debates. If the Libertarian nominee for president, and I hope that's me, is in the presidential debates, I think that a lot of things can change in this country."</blockquote>
<p>When prodded by Cavuto as to whether or not a Gary Johnson candidacy might "hurt" the eventual republican nominee, Johnson rebuffed saying, "I think a lot of people hold to that belief,&nbsp;but in fact, that's not the case at all. When it comes to Libertarians, Libertarians draw as many votes from Democrats&nbsp;as they do from&nbsp;Republicans."</p>
