<p><strong><span>WASHINGTON</span>, <span>Jan. 8, 2016</span> /PRNewswire-USNewswire/</strong> --&nbsp;President Obama's executive actions on gun control falsely link mental health conditions and gun violence, and violate civil rights protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), says the <a href="http://www.ncmhr.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery</a> (NCMHR), an organization of statewide networks of individuals with psychiatric diagnoses.</p>

<p>"By linking mental health issues with gun violence, the President exacerbates the discrimination and prejudice associated with mental health conditions and drives people away from seeking treatment," said NCMHR board president <span>Daniel B. Fisher</span>, M.D., Ph.D., a psychiatrist who himself recovered from schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Other national disability rights organizations – including the <a href="http://www.aapd.com/resources/press-room/gun-violence-executive-action-statement.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Association of People with Disabilities</a>, the<a href="http://autisticadvocacy.org/2016/01/asan-opposes-ssa-rep-payee-gun-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autistic Self-Advocacy Network</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bazelon.org/News-Publications/Press-Releases/Gun-Violence-Executive-Action-Statement.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law</a> – also oppose President Obama's actions to include individuals who use representative payees to manage their Social Security benefits in the gun background check database.</p>

<p>"As the <a href="https://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/2016/ncd-reacts-president%E2%80%99s-gun-control-proposals" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Council on Disability</a> notes," Dr. Fisher continued, "'linking the need for a representative payee with a presumption of incapacity to exercise any right sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the goals of the ADA: equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.' And publicizing the names of individuals in identified populations constitutes a gross violation of their privacy rights and a dangerous marginalization of an already oppressed group."</p>

<p>Nor will such efforts decrease gun violence. As a federal website notes,&nbsp;"The vast majority of people with mental health problems are <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/myths-facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">no more likely to be violent</a> than anyone else."&nbsp;Most people with mental health conditions&nbsp;are not violent and only 3%-5% of violent acts can be attributed to them.&nbsp;In fact, people with severe mental health conditions <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o5pqqnb" rel="noopener noreferrer">are over 10 times more likely to be victims</a>&nbsp;of violent crime than the general population.</p>

<p>When economist&nbsp;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/63z6doq" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Florida&nbsp;</a>reviewed gun deaths and other social indicators, he found that&nbsp;higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9183525/gun-violence-statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer">more mental health conditions didn't correlate with more gun deaths</a>, Dr. Fisher said. Instead, <span>Florida</span> found that states with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths.</p>

<p>"We need tough gun control laws, such as <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2012/12/16/gun_control_after_connecticut_shooting_could_australia_s_laws_provide_a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia adopted</a>&nbsp;after a mass shooting there in 1996," Dr. Fisher said. "The result was a huge drop in both homicides and suicides."</p>
