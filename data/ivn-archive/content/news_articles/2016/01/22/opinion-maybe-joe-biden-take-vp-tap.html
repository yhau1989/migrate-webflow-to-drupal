<p>There’s no doubt I don’t like VP Joe Biden’s (D) tactics when it comes to throwing both friends and foes under the proverbial bus when it <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/11/06/joe-biden-sabotaged-greg-ormans-campaign-purpose/" rel="noopener noreferrer">advances his platform</a>.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain, vice president ‘Potty Mouth,’ well-known for his timed expletives gets stuff done in Washington and is well liked in the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>On numerous occasions he has stated that he regrets his decision not to run for the presidency, citing family concerns, but as far as a stable, reliable, likable, baggage-free, and electable Democrat, he’s right at the top of the list.</p>

<p>So, why not take the tap for VP a second time?</p>

<p>Both Clinton and Sanders would be crazy to not at least consider him as their VP pick, adding stability to their own problematic campaigns.</p>

<p>Hillary is seen as having way too much political baggage, while Sanders has the portrayal of the crazy socialist ready to reinvent the entire economy.</p>

<p>There’s no limit on how often a person can serve as vice president, unlike the president who is limited to a maximum of 10 years.</p>

<p>The one thing Joe Biden does best, though, is playing the attack dog on the campaign trail — he’s good at it and almost seems to enjoy the role.</p>

<p>Whoever the VP pick for the Democratic nominee is, they’d better be an awesome attack dog, protecting their running mate from the opposition while also keeping them above the political fray.</p>

<p>Especially if Trump, Cruz, or even Carson gets the eventual nomination for the Republican Party, it will be all out insults, attacks, and mudslinging from the get go and the Democratic VP pick better be prepared to deflect and deflate the rhetoric.</p>

<p>Who knows, Trump might pick Sarah Palin as his running mate? Biden has already soundly defeated her in the 2008 debates. He would have an edge with experience.</p>

<p>In the final analysis, the Democrats are going to have to bring someone to the table that is liked by the party, liked by the all-important center, and baggage-free. Unfortunately in 2016, that is a pretty short list.</p>
