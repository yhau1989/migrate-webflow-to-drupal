<p>Former Washington Libertarian Party (LPWA) Chairman C. Michael Pickens believes that the nonpartisan, top-two primary is the best system in the country to get Libertarians elected to office. Pickens cites recent successes party candidates have had in Washington state to make his point.</p>
<p>In most states, the primary process is dominated by political parties. Primary voters participate in taxpayer-funded primary elections where candidates are chosen to represent private political parties in the general election.</p>
<p>However, Washington state uses a nonpartisan, top-two primary similar to California. All candidates and voters participate on a single primary ballot and the top two vote-getters, regardless of party preference, move on to the general election.</p>
<p>In an interview for IVN, Pickens discussed the impact the nonpartisan system has had on the LPWA since it was&nbsp;first implemented in 2008, along with&nbsp;his optimism for the future.</p>
<p>According to Pickens, Libertarian leaders in Washington initially interpreted the top-two system as an effort to stifle the influence of third parties.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;he&nbsp;sees top two differently.</p>
<p>He explained that under more traditional partisan&nbsp;systems, Republican candidates typically&nbsp;attack Libertarian candidates, because if there is a Republican, a Democrat, and a Libertarian on the general&nbsp;election ballot, Republicans will accuse the Libertarian of siphoning votes from the GOP.</p>
<p>"They're all going to the general election so the votes are being split," Pickens&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>He argues that general election voters are essentially&nbsp;forced to choose between voting for their preferred candidate and voting for someone else strategically to avoid a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>[pullout_blockquote quote="It is actually a benefit for us because people can vote the way they want in the primary." author="C. Michael Pickens, chairman of Libertarian Party of Washington"] "In Washington state (under top two), one of the strategies we use is we tell people they can vote their conscience in the primary," Pickens&nbsp;said. "It is actually a benefit for us because people can vote the way they want in the primary."</p>
<p>He further explained&nbsp;that as an added bonus, a third-party candidate no longer has&nbsp;to clear the staggering hurdle of placing first in a general election against a Democrat, a Republican, and perhaps others. Now, a second place finish in the primary is good enough to move on to a contest against just one opponent.</p>
<p>These benefits are not just theoretical, either. Pickens said that after the LPWA&nbsp;shifted its focus in how it recruited candidates and running solid campaigns, the party ran 12 candidates in 2014, 8 of whom made it to the general election. The elections resulted in the highest vote totals in LPWA history.</p>
<p>Further, the party continues to solidify its infrastructure across the state. In 2015, the party fielded 17 candidates, 5 of whom won in local races. The LPWA more than doubled its elected representation&nbsp;from 4 to 9.</p>
<p>"Now we have 23 candidates lined up to run right now that are confirmed and I think 9 potential candidates," Pickens added.</p>
<p>While minor&nbsp;party challenges to top two have diminished in Washington state,&nbsp;they still exist in California, where some party leaders have encouraged their members&nbsp;not to vote&nbsp;in the general election in&nbsp;some races out of protest against the nonpartisan system.</p>
<p>Opponents of top two argue that it diminishes voter choice, restricting options available to voters in the general election when the most people historically participate.&nbsp;With limited&nbsp;voter support, third parties have a tough hurdle to clear to get to the November election under top two.</p>
<p>In response, Pickens says that party leaders should spend less time squabbling over procedure and more time where it counts – campaigning and getting people to the polls.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is third parties have to go to work,” he said. “If we can't get second place in a primary, we're never going to be able to get first place in the general.”</p>
<p>For Pickens, this means going door-to-door, putting up door hangers, and other traditional forms of advertising and campaigning that he says is working for the party now that they have built up a solid infrastructure in the state.</p>
<p>Pickens says there are alternative voting methods and election systems that he would prefer, such as ranked-choice voting and the use of multi-member districts with proportional representation. However, he&nbsp;says top-two is an improvement from what Washington state used to have and&nbsp;was even one of his motivations to move to the state.</p>
<p>“I think we have the best system in the country to get Libertarians elected," Pickens concluded. "If we can get a Libertarian elected to state office, we can actually do a whole lot more around the country, because that will give other people permission, and motivation, and inspiration that maybe they can do that in their state."</p>
