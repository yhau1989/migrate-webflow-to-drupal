<p>Google and Voting Information Project (VIP) teamed up in 2012 to give voters all the information they need in one place. Since then, Google has gained more partners each election year, and now provides the same location-based voting information along with The Pew Charitable Trusts and Internet Association.</p>

<p>Location-based information provides the nearest poll location, election date, sample ballot, and contact information for the secretary of state.</p>
