<p><b>SAN DIEGO, CALIF.</b><span>- Dramatic changes to California’s primary election results could be in store as more than approximately three million ballots still need to be counted. The Secretary of State reports a little more than 5.9 million have been counted so far. </span></p>

<p>The numbers could have a big impact on statewide races, including the Democratic presidential race. As we stand today, Bernie Sanders trails Hillary Clinton by about 400,000 votes but that will very likely change in two week’s time. Some pundits have even speculated Sanders could overtake Clinton and win the state of California.</p>

<p>Local races up and down the state will likely also be impacted.</p>

<p><span>In the </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/06/08/district-1-race-too-close-to-call/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>District One City Council race</span></a><span> in San Diego, Democrat Barbara Bry stands at just over 49%, and with a fair amount of Democratic and liberal votes remaining to be counted, it’s conceivable that Bry could reach the 50% plus one threshold and end the race. The city does not allow the top two vote-getters to square off in a November runoff if one candidate gets 50% plus one.</span></p>

<p>Some media have predicted voter turnout for this primary to be in the 30% range, and while that number is correct for the moment, the outstanding ballots will likely take the turnout to at least between 45-50%.</p>

<p>In the 2008 presidential primary, California voter turnout reached 58%.</p>

<p>Sam Mahood, press secretary with California’s Secretary of State office, told IVN San Diego, “As we are still awaiting reports of all the uncounted ballots, it is premature to comment on voter turnout.”</p>

<p>The County Registrar in San Diego, Michael Vu, is planning to release additional numbers later tonight, tomorrow, and then again Monday. In San Diego County, there are 285,000 mail and provisional ballots that have yet to be counted.</p>

<p>Here is the San Diego schedule for when additional numbers will be released:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><span> By 5 p.m., Thursday, June 9th</span></li>
 	<li><span> By 5 p.m., Friday, June 10th</span></li>
 	<li><span> By 5 p.m., Monday, June 13th</span></li>
 	<li><span> By 5 p.m., Tuesday, June 14th</span></li>
 	<li><span> By 5 p.m., Friday, June 17th</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, keep in mind, turnout figures are preliminary and will change. Counties have about 28 days to canvass the ballots and certify the results for the Secretary of State's office. Ballots are still being counted, and even still coming in — voters could send in vote-by-mail ballots as late as Tuesday.</p>

<p><span>Results will likely be finalized in the next two-and-a-half-weeks.</span></p>
