<p><span>After the Colorado Legislature </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/13/colorados-unaffiliated-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>failed to pass</span></a><span> two bills that would 1) establish a presidential primary and 2) open primary elections to independents, citizens are taking these measures into their own hands.</span></p>

[gravityform id="64" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]

<p><span>One group, </span><a href="http://www.letcovote2016.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Let Colorado Vote</span></a><span>, is working toward placing two initiatives on the November ballot. One initiative would re-institute a presidential primary and open it to unaffiliated voters, and the second initiative would open all remaining statewide primary elections to the state’s 1.3 million unaffiliated voters.</span></p>

<p><span>Independent (or unaffiliated) voters are the fastest growing voting bloc in the United States, representing </span><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/188096/democratic-republican-identification-near-historical-lows.aspx?g_source=Politics&amp;g_medium=newsfeed&amp;g_campaign=tiles" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>42%</span></a><span> of voters and now outnumbering Republicans and Democrats.</span></p>

<p><span>In Colorado, unaffiliated voters are the largest voting bloc, making up almost </span><a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VoterRegNumbers/VoterRegNumbers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>37% of the electorate</span></a><span>. In 2014 alone, a staggering </span><a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/03/02/colorado-caucuses-presidential-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>67%</span></a><span> of new registrants in Colorado chose to be unaffiliated.</span></p>

<p>"Because all taxpayers pay for elections, it’s not right to force voters who want to be independent to join a political party just to have their voice heard," Let Colorado Vote argues.</p>

<p>It is likely these initiatives will be on the November ballot. In fact, Colorado resident and famed signature-gatherer <strong>Carlo Scarsella</strong> uses the lure of a possible presidential primary that is open to independents as a way to spark interest in other state initiatives.</p>

<p><span>Scarsella </span><a href="https://www.cpr.org/news/story/winning-friends-and-influencing-politics-go-guy-signature-collecting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told Colorado Public Radio</span></a><span> that “there are so many disenfranchised unaffiliateds that they’re everywhere. So [an open presidential primary] really grabs their interest.”</span></p>

<p><span>There was quite the outrage among Colorado voters this year after the chaotic caucuses. Democratic voters were frustrated by the </span><a href="http://www.coloradoindependent.com/158071/unexpected-turnout-throws-boulder-caucus-into-chaos" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>long waits and overcrowded precincts</span></a><span>. On the other side, Republican voters didn’t even have the chance to participate because the Republican Party </span><a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/11/voter-burns-republican-party-registration-over-colorados-rigged-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>decided against holding a presidential preference poll</span></a><span> at their caucus.</span></p>

<p>And, the notion of an open presidential primary especially grabs voters' interest now because the March caucuses proved how limiting this type of election system is to voter participation.</p>

<p><span>Caucuses limit participation, Let Colorado Vote explains. There are more than 3.6 million registered voters in Colorado and only 5% participated in the caucuses. Compare this to Wisconsin’s open presidential primary turnout of </span><a href="http://www.fairvote.org/2016_presidential_primary_voter_turnout_analysis_to_date" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>49%</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Let Colorado Vote points out that Colorado is one of just 20 states where unaffiliated voters can’t participate in the presidential nominating process without first re-registering with a political party, one of 17 states that close congressional primaries to unaffiliated voters, and one of only 13 states where legislative primaries are closed to independents. Not to mention, Colorado is one of just 14 states that rely on a caucus system. </span></p>

<p><span>In November, Colorado could join the majority of states that allow independent voters the chance to participate in primary elections that are taxpayer-funded.</span></p>

<p><span>As <strong>Joey Bunch</strong> of </span><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>The Denver Post</span></a> <a href="https://social.newsinc.com/media/json/69017/30727399/singleVideoOG.html?videoId=30727399&amp;type=VideoPlayer%2F16x9&amp;widgetId=2&amp;trackingGroup=69017" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>explains</span></a><span>:</span></p>

<p><em>“It’s their tax dollars paying for these primaries. That’s like throwing a party in my backyard, drinking my beer, and then telling me I can’t come.”</em></p>
