<p>This week, voters in eastern North Carolina will have the opportunity to <a href="http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/news/article_414a72fc-2abb-11e6-ace9-9b06be2ffbb0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">decide</a> the political fate of one of its more independent members.</p>

<p>U.S. Rep. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/search/walter+jones" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Jones</a></strong>, a Republican representing North Carolina's third district since 1995, will engage in a re-match against former political consultant Taylor Griffin. In 2014, Griffin, a former adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain, <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/02/24/partisans-threaten-independent-rep-walter-jones-incumbency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost</a> to Jones by a 51-45 margin.</p>

<p>Jones is perhaps best known for his policy stances - against Middle Eastern wars and his effort to <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/09/08/rep-walter-jones-leads-effort-declassify-full-911-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">declassify</a> 28 pages of the 9/11 Report - that reflect a political independence. The North Carolina third district is reliably Republican, though Jones' antiwar stances have often <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/22281/how_walter_jones_grew_a_conscience" rel="noopener noreferrer">drawn</a> <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/02/24/partisans-threaten-independent-rep-walter-jones-incumbency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention</a> because the district is home to Marine base Camp Lejeune.</p>

<p>In their previous contest, Griffin focused on Jones' tendency to vote against his own party, <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/24/independent-republican-walter-jones-faces-tough-primary-challenge-n-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer">noting</a> that "California should have the most liberal Republican [House member], not eastern North Carolina."</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Jones is perhaps best known for his policy stances - against Middle Eastern wars and his effort to declassify 28 pages of the 9/11 Report - that reflect a political independence. " author=""]

<p>Jones has answered objections that he is insufficiently partisan by <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article60075776.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, "When my party is right, I'm proud to vote with my party," while conceding that not every policy proposed by the GOP is best for his district.</p>

<p>This year, Griffin is focusing on foreign policy to counter his opponent. In one ad, Griffin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMjSPf9jQSI" rel="noopener noreferrer">charges</a> that Jones "empowered Obama to cut a deal with Iran," while the former promises to "stand with our friends and against our enemies."</p>

<p>However, FactCheck.org, a <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/spindetectors/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, investigated the ad and <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/rep-jones-didnt-empower-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer">deemed</a> it misleading. Griffin's claim was based on Jones' signing of a <a href="http://fcnl.org/issues/iran/ellison_jones.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> sent to President Barack Obama to engage in "robust, sustained diplomacy" with Iran, but which did not grant the president additional power to negotiate such a deal. Jones eventually <a href="https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-votes-against-iran-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> against the agreement.</p>

<p>Along with foreign policy, money may play a critical factor in the North Carolina race. According to OpenSecrets.org, Griffin has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/states/cands.php?state=NC" rel="noopener noreferrer">outraised</a> Jones $641,446 to $493,224.</p>

<p>A criticism of Griffin's 2014 run was that many of his campaign contributions came from outside the North Carolina third district. Among his donors in 2016 is <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/singer_paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Singer</a>, a well-known GOP backer of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/05/03/meet-the-billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-quietly-shaping-the-gop-gay-marriage-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gay rights</a> and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/gop-donor-paul-singer-immigration-reform-090726" rel="noopener noreferrer">amnesty</a> for illegal immigrants. Despite Griffin's stated <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article80431297.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposition</a> to those <a href="http://taylorgriffin.org/illegal-immigration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a>, the two presumably have shared <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/neoconservative-super-pac-bets-big-north-carolina-gop-primary-challenge/" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawkish</a> <a href="https://lobelog.com/for-neocon-megadonor-paul-singer-israel-trumps-gay-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign policy</a> visions.</p>

<p>Jones was quick to <a href="http://www.walterjonescommittee.com/seriously" rel="noopener noreferrer">capitalize</a> on the <a href="https://twitter.com/greggiroux/status/735497238525399040" rel="noopener noreferrer">money</a> issue when Griffin held a campaign fundraiser at the Chevy Chase, Maryland home of&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbying-hires/243205-american-bankers-association-names-keatings-successor" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Nichols</a>, a man Jones termed a "Wall Street lobbyist." Griffin and Nichols <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/03/31/an-emergency-kibbles-and-bits-kit/a1981061-810a-4911-8167-b92e48978b87/" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked</a> together in the Treasury Department under the George W. Bush administration.</p>

<p>A third Republican, <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/06/29/battle-tested-congressman-prepares-another-fight-party-hawks-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Law</a>, is also in the race, but lacks the money and name recognition of either Jones or Griffin. However, political observers believe&nbsp;that any support Law garners, as an anti-Jones candidate, would essentially siphon votes from Griffin and diminish the candidate's chances of defeating Jones.</p>

<p>North Carolina held its presidential primary in March and low voter <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article79570877.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">turnout</a> is expected.</p>
