<p>While the Republican Party is trying to unify its members behind the party's presumptive nominee, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, there are some GOP lawmakers, consultants, and politicos who&nbsp;are still holding on to the <strong>#NeverTrump</strong> movement as long as they can.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/federal-politics/sasse-considers-libertarian-presidential-vote/article_f465a94c-cdef-595d-af42-31216db55ad2.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Journal-Star</a>, there is only one Republican senator who has said he refuses&nbsp;to support his party's nominee: <strong>Ben Sasse</strong> (R-Neb.) Sasse says that no matter what happens, he will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Sasse is not sure who he will be voting for come November, but he did tell Journal-Star that he was looking at the Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>"The Libertarian Party is something I would certainly consider in the long term," he said. He also said he hadn't looked closely at the party or its nominee.</p>

<p>Gary Johnson <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/30/governor-johnson-must-included-presidential-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">secured the Libertarian nomination</a> at the party's convention in May and is joined by Liberatrian-Republican&nbsp;Bill Weld.&nbsp;Johnson is a former governor of New Mexico, serving 8 years from 1995 to 2003, while Bill Weld served as governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997.</p>

<p>With Weld on his ticket, its possible that Sasse may not be the only Republican who turns to Johnson as prospects for additional alternatives become slimmer.</p>

<p>With increased interest from the media and <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/19/gary-johnson-just-became-a-serious-presidential-contender/" rel="noopener noreferrer">unconfirmed rumors</a> that Johnson and Weld are attracting high-profile donors like David Koch, this may be the first year a third party candidate meets the 15 percent polling threshold to qualify for the fall debates.</p>
