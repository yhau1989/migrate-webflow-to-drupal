<p>The all-powerful ability to form cloture in the Senate.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the Republic, the feature of requiring three-fifths (or at times two-thirds) of the Senate to cut-off debate of a topic has been used for political jockeying and as a legitimate tactic for the minority position to be heard.</p>

<p>While a viable tactic, it has been one that has had mixed results -- sometimes only slowing the inevitable down.</p>

<p>Other times, such as <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/filibuster-ends-after-gop-agrees-allow-gun-control-votes-senator-n593396" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senator Chris Murphy's (D-CT)</a>&nbsp;filibuster trying to&nbsp;convince Republican leaders to allow votes on gun control issues, filibusters work. Republican leaders acquiesced to the demands and conceded&nbsp;to allowing votes to occur.</p>

<p>Sometimes the filibuster is a protest on one's own majority party, as was the case with Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) filibuster that was only supported by <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/ted-cruz-blasted-by-angry-gop-colleagues-government-shutdown-097753" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 fellow Republicans </a>and brought down the anger of the Republican leadership -- anger that would eventually hurt his presidential bid in 2016.</p>

<p>But most often, as in the case of Strom Thurmond's marathon filibuster in 1957, not a single vote changed and the Civil Rights Act passed as written.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1229297" rel="noopener noreferrer">scholarly opinion</a> since the 1990's has been that the threat of filibuster in the Senate has created a de facto super-majority requirement for legislation to become law.</p>

<p>Prior to the 20th century, filibusters weren't as common, largely due to the senator's beholden to the state legislatures and Senate politics were often marked by entrenched state/region-specific issues.</p>

<p>Senators first loyalty was to their state legislatures, then party alliances (often determined by the make-up of the state legislature). Once senators were no longer beholden to the individual states, their first allegiance seems to be their political party, not the voter.</p>

<p>Because of this, factions could form that could gain enough votes to stage a filibuster.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The idea of a filibuster is that it is a tool within our system for the minority opinion to be heard." author=""]

<p>So why doesn't the Senate change the rules, especially when one party controls the Senate with an overwhelming majority?</p>

<p>Almost 20&nbsp;times during the 20th century, the Democrats had super-majorities in the Senate. They could have changed the rules at any time. Why didn't they?</p>

<p>They did some constant tinkering with the rules, making it easier to break filibusters with a 3/5 vote instead of a 2/3, but the practice was left unscathed.</p>

<p>Simply put, the Democrats knew full well that the tides of politics ebb and flow; eventually, they may be using the same stalling practices.</p>

<p>While Senator Murphy got his way in this most recent filibuster, it's definitely not a given that the other side will cave to demands. In fact, it often strengthens resolves.</p>

<p>The idea of a filibuster is that it is a tool within our system for the minority opinion to be heard. Our country is based on the principle of majority rule, with respect of the minority opinion.</p>

<p>Once the minority opinion no longer has a voice, the entire process just becomes a rubber stamp for the majority's will.</p>

<p>We need the filibuster to remain where it is, a tool to be brought out and used when things need to be slowed down or when bad legislation needs more press coverage.</p>

<p>Because in the end, public opinion of the filibuster is often the only true measure of whether or not it will be effective -- Senate leaders can't ignore public opinion without taking the risk of losing support.</p>
