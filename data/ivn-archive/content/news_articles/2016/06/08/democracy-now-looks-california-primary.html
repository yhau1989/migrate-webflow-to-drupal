<p><strong>Democracy Now!</strong> turned its attention to Californiaâ€™s primary Tuesday, focusing on the excitement surrounding 600,000 new registered voters in the last two months and what that means with the current presidential primary rules in the state.</p>

<p>In its segment, Democracy Now! featured the <a href="https://youtu.be/Z1jcQYbMSL0" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest video</a> from the <a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Independent Voter Project</strong></a> that sought to help voters navigate the rules ahead of the primary and on primary election day (At 51:40).</p>

<p>Host Amy Goodman and Rose Aguilar discussed reports of thousands of voters being excluded from the presidential primary due to broad confusion over the rules; especially, among independent voters new to the process:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Independent voters are labeled&nbsp;No Party Preference, which becomes confusing when there is a party called the American Independent Party. <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/04/01/campaign-warns-independents-fooled-american-independent-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence</a> shows hundreds of thousands of voters mistakenly registered with the party.</li>
 	<li>Aguilar mentioned that No Party Preference voters needed to actively request a party ballot or else they received&nbsp;a NPP ballot with no presidential candidates on it.</li>
 	<li>An early&nbsp;exit poll found that of 250,000 people who already turned in their ballots, nearly half of the&nbsp;people did not vote for president, likely because they did not request a crossover ballot and were not told their options.</li>
 	<li>Many voters casting a ballot by mail reportedly received the wrong ballot for president. If they returned a completed&nbsp;ballot for other statewide races without the presidential race, they lost their right to vote in the presidential contest in 2016.</li>
 	<li>Parties dictate the rules for 'their' taxpayer-funded presidential primaries, which means the rules can change from one election year to the other. In 2016, independent voters could cast a ballot in the Democratic, Libertarian, and American Independent primaries. Crossover voting between parties is not allowed under the semi-closed rules.</li>
</ul>
