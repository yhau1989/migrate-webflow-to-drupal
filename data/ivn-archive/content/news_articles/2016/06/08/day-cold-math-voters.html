headline: 4 Harsh Realities Voters Will Face Going into the November Elections

<p>I've never liked the lesser-of-two-evils type of election. It's bad politics and the <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/08/12/poll-voters-must-choose-two-choices-dont-trust/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voters deserve better</a>.</p>

<p>But after Tuesday&nbsp;night, the near end of the primary season, the cold math becomes a race between <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has secured an overwhelming number of delegates to win the Republican nomination; Clinton will have enough delegates (after all the votes are counted) that she only needs the support of about 150 superdelegates to clinch the nomination at the convention.</p>

<p>It doesn't look like either side has a viable option for stopping the nomination of these two candidates, other than some pre-convention rules switch-a-roo.</p>

<p>Today is the day we face the harsh realities of the 2016 -- ones that many are not going to be happy with.</p>
<h2><strong>1. 'I'm voting against ____'</strong></h2>
<p>This is going to dominate political discussions and decisions until the November election.</p>

<p>The reality is, there will be millions of voters who will go to the polls and vote for a candidate they don't like, because they like the other one even less.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that America has been saddled with poor candidates (consider the election of 1912, with <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/19/trump-isnt-first-say-anything-candidate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teddy Roosevelt as a sore-loser candidate</a>), and the voters usually make the parties suffer for it.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Expect your party nomination practices to change in the next 4 years</strong></h2>
<p>Both parties are likely to create rules that fundamentally change how candidates are picked in the next 4 years. Some of these rules may be good, some bad.</p>

<p>The Republicans will probably focus on something that doesn't reward a 'less-than-majority' winner enough to capture the White House, or even put into place party 'safety-valves' to give the party at least some control of a 'runaway' process.</p>

<p>The Democrats will almost certainly amend the superdelegate structure. They have prided themselves in that no race has ever been decided with superdelegates -- until this one.</p>

<p>Both parties will probably continue their <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/03/dnc-chair-independents-wouldnt-allowed-vote-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">war on independents</a> and try to <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/05/25/gop-party-leaders-consider-shutting-out-independents-in-more-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">close off more and more avenues</a> for independents to vote in the primaries, limiting the influence of 'outsiders' on 'their' political process.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Don't expect an independent 'Savior' candidate</strong></h2>
<p>People need to fully grasp the mechanics of living in a federal republic.</p>

<p>A candidate doesn't just sign up at the FEC in Washington, D.C. and get put on the ballot in all 50 states for the general election.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Both parties will probably continue their war on independents and try to close off more and more avenues for independents to vote in the primaries." author=""]

<p>The party nominees automatically get that gift (on the ballot in all 50 states), while any independent running&nbsp;has to petition in each state (each state has their own rules, so this isn't a universal formula),&nbsp;get the&nbsp;petitions certified, and then get on the ballots -- all by a deadline that has long past in almost every state.</p>

<p>Some of the confusion on this is probably the 1992 Ross Perot run for the White House. He had an early ground-pounding campaign in the states to get on the ballot, but then he dropped out of the race for a while, only to return in October of the election year.</p>

<p>Swooping back in at the end has probably left the impression with too many that a candidate can launch a 50-state challenge whenever they choose, but that is far from reality.</p>

<p>Had he not done the significant legwork in the 50 states prior to dropping out, he would never have been able to swoop back in at the last minute.</p>

<p>Likewise, there will be no last minute independent political 'savior' candidate; we're stuck with what we have.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Before voting for a minor party candidate....</strong></h2>
<p>Some have openly stated they have no intention of supporting one of the major&nbsp;party candidates.</p>

<p>The old adage is that voting for a minor party candidate is throwing your vote away.</p>

<p>That might be debatable, but voting for a minor party candidate that isn't on the ballot in even half of the states is definitely a wasted vote.</p>

<p>Before choosing to vote for a minor party candidate,&nbsp;<em><strong>make sure they are on the ballot in enough states to matter, preferably all of them.</strong></em></p>

<p>While there is no date on <a href="http://www.jill2016.com/ballotaccess" rel="noopener noreferrer">this webpage</a>, Jill Stein (Green Party Candidate) can highlight this problem: at the time this page was last updated, she was not on the ballot in 29 states (considering this is her official campaign site, you'd hope the information would be current).</p>

<p>While she can campaign, make a lot of speeches, get some support, and financial backing, the simple reality is that she could never attain the 270 electoral votes needed to win.</p>

<p>This is the coldest math of all when considering a minor party candidate -- that being whether or not they will even be on the ballot in enough states to matter.</p>
<h2><strong>In the end... VOTE!</strong></h2>
<p>Regardless, the worst kind of voter is the one who stays home and chooses to not vote.</p>

<p>Cast your ballot for where it will do the most good (or the least damage), but don't throw it away or just not use it.</p>

<p>Don't try to use your vote as a 'message' to the parties -- they are already receiving the message loud and clear. Vote for whomever you think can both win and govern in your best interest.</p>

<p>2016 is a referendum to the parties on the 2020 election; a big reset button is about to be pushed in the parties -- from rule changes to party platforms.</p>

<p>The political parties can wait 4 more years for their next chance -- the American voter cannot. We need to cast our votes where we believe they will do the most good.</p>
