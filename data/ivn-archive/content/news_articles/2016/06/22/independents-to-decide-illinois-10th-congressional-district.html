<p>For the third consecutive election, the Illinois 10th congressional district will see the same candidates battle each other in a race where independent voters could make the difference.</p>

<p>The district has witnessed some of the tightest elections in recent history. <strong>Robert Dold</strong> won in 2010 before consultant and Democrat <strong>Brad Schneider</strong> defeated him two years later. The Republican returned in 2014 and defeated Schneider. The margin of victory for the winner in each of the past three elections were <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/house/il/illinois_10th_district_dold_vs_seals-1284.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/house/il/illinois_10th_district_dold_vs_schneider-3304.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, and <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/house/il/illinois_10th_district_dold_vs_schneider-4888.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a> percent respectively.</p>

<p><a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2016/06/ils-10th-cd-congressional-race-to-be-another-expensive-squeaker.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polling</a> for the 2016 contest done by each party shows its corresponding candidate in the lead, suggesting that the race is a true toss-up.</p>

<p>The 10th district covers much of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/IL/10" rel="noopener noreferrer">northeastern</a> corner of Illinois, particularly the northern suburbs of Chicago in Lake County. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-illinois-10th-district-primary-20160308-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to the Partisan Voting Index of the Cook Political Report, the Illinois 10th congressional <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2016/06/ils-10th-cd-congressional-race-to-be-another-expensive-squeaker.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">district</a> is the most liberal to have a Republican representative, so moderate and independent voters may well be the deciding factor in the race.</p>

<p>In attempting to reclaim his old seat in 2014, Dold <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/04/democrats-may-lose-illinois-10th-congressional-district-2014/" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> himself as an "independent-thinking moderate." In a biographical statement on his 2016 campaign website, Dold leads off by <a href="http://doldforcongress.com/about-bob-dold/" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a> he is "currently serving his second term as an independent voice for the Tenth District of Illinois in the United States Congress." Dold also <a href="http://dold.house.gov/press-releases?ID=252D42C3-E54C-4C04-B706-76CAAA61D6E1" rel="noopener noreferrer">touts</a> his support for bipartisan measures, including reforming the partisan drawing of congressional districts:</p>
<blockquote>"There's no doubt that gerrymandering has led to a deeply partisan political climate. We need to end the backwards practice of letting politicians choose their voters instead of letting people choose their representatives."</blockquote>
<p>In addition to presenting himself as an independent, Dold also emphasizes his moderation compared to other Republicans. Dold has previously broken with his party over <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/266024-illinois-republican-backs-pro-lgbt-rights-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer">gay rights</a>, <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2012/06/dold-explains-why-he-opposed-the-gender-based-abortion-ban.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">abortion</a> restrictions, and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/283425-gop-lawmaker-breaks-with-party-calls-for-votes-on-gun-control" rel="noopener noreferrer">gun control</a>. He was also one of the first <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-republicans-donald-trump-222875" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans</a> to publicly <a href="http://www.wlsam.com/2016/05/06/breaking-r-congressman-bob-dold-says-he-will-not-endorse-donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">refuse</a> to support Donald Trump for president due to the businessman's comments on women, Latinos, Muslims, and POWs.</p>

<p>However, Dold's decision refusing to support Trump may not necessarily help him. Trump was the top vote-getting Republican in Lake County with <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/IL/Lake/59197/163847/Web01/en/summary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">36%</a>, not far from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/illinois" rel="noopener noreferrer">39%</a> showing he used to win majority of state's delegates.</p>

<p>The outcome of the Illinois 10th congressional district could also be decided by the higher voter turnout of a presidential election compared to a midterm. The year Schneider won, 2012, was a presidential election year. That year, Schneider <a href="http://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/ElectionInformation/VoteTotals/2012GEOfficialVote.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished</a> 3,000 votes ahead of Dold with 133,000. By contrast, Dold <a href="http://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/ElectionInformation/VoteTotals/2014GEOfficialVote.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">regained</a> the seat in 2014 against Schneider by needing only 95,000.</p>
