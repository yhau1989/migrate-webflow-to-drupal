<p>Los Angeles, CALIF. - Democratic Congressional candidate&nbsp;<strong>Loretta Sanchez</strong>&nbsp;received a big endorsement from the former Republican&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Riordan" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayor of Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;<strong>Richard Riordan</strong>.</p>

<p>Sanchez is&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2016/06/08/harris-sanchez-face-off-dem-v-dem-showdown-u-s-senate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently second</a>&nbsp;to Attorney General Democrat&nbsp;<strong>Kamala Harris</strong>&nbsp;in the race for the U.S. Senate's 46th district seat.</p>

<p>Getting Riordan's support is big for Sanchez, who will need all the Republican votes she can muster to overtake Harris.</p>

<p>Responding to the endorsement, Sanchez said, "I have tremendous respect for Mayor&nbsp;Riordan’s commitment to public service, and I’m honored to have his endorsement for the U.S. Senate." She added:</p>
<blockquote>“Coming from a working-class family, I know that nothing pulls people out of poverty more effectively than a good paying job, and as U.S. Senator, I will work with leaders across the aisle, business and labor leaders, and workers to strengthen our economy so that more Californians may have economic security.”</blockquote>
<p>Riordan remains one of the most respected political figures in Los Angeles. He was mayor from 1993-2001 and to date, is the last Republican to serve as Mayor of Los Angeles. Riordan said, "I’ve known Loretta Sanchez for many years, she is tough and not afraid to take a stand on important issues." He added, "Loretta knows how to work with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. She is the leader we need in the U.S. Senate."</p>

<p>Sanchez anchored her primary campaign by highlighting her votes against the war in Iraq and the Wall Street bailout. The Riordan endorsement should do two things: 1) secure crossover Republican votes and 2) consolidate her southern California base.</p>
