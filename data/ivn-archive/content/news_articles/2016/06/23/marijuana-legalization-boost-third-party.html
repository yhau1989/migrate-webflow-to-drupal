<p>Third-party presidential candidates, <strong>Gary Johnson</strong> and Dr. <strong>Jill Stein,</strong> do not have the same advantages as <strong>Donald Trump</strong> or <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>. However, both candidates mounted presidential bids in 2012 and&nbsp;may gain&nbsp;new political ground this election year thanks to one issue - marijuana legalization.</p>

<p>A recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/568faad2-81ab-4bd0-b373-8577326e76bd.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monmouth University</a>&nbsp;poll shows&nbsp;third-party candidates, Johnson and Stein,&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;13 percent of likely voters and 26 percent of the total independent voters.&nbsp;Johnson, the presumptive Libertarian Party nominee received 9 percent and Stein, the Green Party nominee received 4 percent.</p>

<p>While Stein and Johnson were pro-legalization during their&nbsp;2012 campaigns, the issue&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/06/01/poll-results-gary-johnson/" rel="noopener noreferrer">did not resonate&nbsp;with voters</a>&nbsp;enough to catapult either candidate into the forefront, but four years later, new pro-legalization voters are coming into the fold.</p>

,&nbsp;"[t]he fact that a majority of American voters favors legalizing marijuana in general shows how attitudes about the drug have changed."<p><strong>Tim Malloy</strong>, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll,&nbsp;states in a <a href="http://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2354" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent poll</a></p>

<p>According to the Quinnipiac poll: 36 percent of Republicans, 65 percent of Democrats, and 61 percent of independents think the use of marijuana should be legalized - which amounts to about 54 percent of voters nationwide. The findings are similar to a 2015 Pew Poll, where <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/14/in-debate-over-legalizing-marijuana-disagreement-over-drugs-dangers/?utm_source=viz&amp;utm_medium=viz.referral&amp;utm_campaign=viz.ref.3844&amp;utm_viz_id=e9RXN96JQjz&amp;utm_pubreferrer=ivn.us%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong majorities</a> of Democrats and independents favored legalization.</p>

<p>Both Trump and Clinton have staked out softer positions on the issue, favoring legalizing marijuana for medicinal use only - and in Trump's case - leaving the rest up to the states.</p>

<p>Johnson has been outspoken, touting&nbsp;the economic and social benefits of legalization, not to mention&nbsp;sharing his own experience as the former CEO of Cannabis Sativa Inc.&nbsp;<span>"Marijuana products, from a medicinal standpoint, directly compete with legal prescription drugs that kill 100,000 people a year... There has not been one documented death due to marijuana,"&nbsp;Johnson&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/marijuana-legalization-2016-libertarian-gary-johnson-explains-why-he-supports-legal-2383547" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told the International Business Times</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Likewise, Dr. Stein&nbsp;</span><a href="http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/l/44/Jill-Stein" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported the national legalization of marijuana</a><span> in her Green Party for both nominations.</span></p>

<p>Contrary to 2012, a major party nominee also supported marijuana legalization this election.&nbsp;<strong>Bernie Sanders&nbsp;</strong>called for&nbsp;<a href="http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-drug-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">legalizing the recreational use of marijuana </a>nationally, as well.</p>

<p>The support for the legalization of marijuana is up. Whether or not the&nbsp;third party candidates can&nbsp;become a rising threat to the major parties remains to be seen.</p>
