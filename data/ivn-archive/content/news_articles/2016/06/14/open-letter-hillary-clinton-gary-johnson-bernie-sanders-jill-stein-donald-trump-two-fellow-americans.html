<p><em>This open letter was written by Jacqueline&nbsp;Salit, president of IndependentVoting.org, and Cathy Stewart, vice president of <a href="http://IndependentVoting.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndependentVoting.org</a>.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 48 hours since the mass murder in Orlando, the political environment in our&nbsp;country is worsening. Leaders such as yourselves — who seek the office of the presidency — must take responsibility for that. Put campaign interests aside and&nbsp;have a serious and principled conversation together and with the American people&nbsp;about the unsettling nature of this devastating act of violence, rather than jockey&nbsp;for position and votes.</p>

<p>We call on you to suspend your campaigning to hold a joint press conference to&nbsp;demonstrate that communicating across the ideological and partisan divide serves&nbsp;the American people best. Whatever differences exist with respect to a posture on&nbsp;terrorism and crimes in the name of Islam, on gun violence and on the free&nbsp;expression of human sexuality, it would be meaningful to the American people for&nbsp;such a joint action to take place. Law enforcement is doing its job, and it is a&nbsp;difficult one. But it's not sufficient for any of us to say on Facebook or Twitter or at&nbsp;the Tony Awards or at campaign rallies that these events must make us stronger,&nbsp;unless we actually do something to make ourselves stronger. You cannot say this&nbsp;is a time where Americans must stand together if the presumptive leaders won’t.</p>

<p>The problem is that the culture of our partisan election system makes it difficult, if&nbsp;not impossible, to respond as a unified nation. Everything that the Orlando&nbsp;massacre raises does not reduce to guns or immigration. And no candidate,&nbsp;regardless of what they claim, has cornered the market on truth.&nbsp;Obviously, a joint appearance among the five of you would be shocking to many,&nbsp;but the violence has already shocked us. A shocking response that changes our&nbsp;political culture might put us—and the world—on a safer and better path.</p>
