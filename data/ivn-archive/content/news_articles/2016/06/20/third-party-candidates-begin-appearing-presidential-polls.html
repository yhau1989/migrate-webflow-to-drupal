<p>A recent poll&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-unfavorables-spike-clintons-challenged-poll/story?id=39856303" rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a> that presumptive nominees <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> have record-high unfavorability ratings: 55 percent and 70 percent, respectively. Yet despite their unpopularity, the general electorate&nbsp;may not be exposed to third party candidates as an alternative.</p>

<p>This is largely a result of the <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">rules</a> governing who is included in the presidential debates. According to guidelines set by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a candidate must poll at 15 percent to be invited to participate. (Note: The <strong><a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> </strong>has <a href="http://ivn.us/2016/04/13/debates-commission-monopoly-reduces-competition/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed an amicus brief</a> in the case to open up the debates.)</p>

<p>The CPD claims that the 15 percent criterion is fair because it treats all candidates equally (no candidate is automatically invited simply for having won a party's nomination) and because, in the words of CPD Director <strong>Dorothy Ridings</strong>, "During the course of the campaign, the candidates are afforded many opportunities in a great variety of forums to advance their candidacies."</p>

<p>But&nbsp;recent polling shows that many voters are not aware of third party options.&nbsp;The results of a Huffington Post/YouGov poll published on June 1, for instance, showed that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-johnson-is-unknown_us_574f3a1ce4b0ed593f1319c5" rel="noopener noreferrer">approximately two-thirds</a>&nbsp;of respondents had&nbsp;not heard of Libertarian Party nominee <strong>Gary Johnson</strong>. Candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, have for months enjoyed billions of dollars of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">"free" media coverage</a>.</p>

<p>Third party candidates find themselves in a kind of catch-22. Because they lack popular support, pollsters often decide not to include them in their surveys; yet this exclusion inhibits their ability to gain exposure and support, as their names are not mentioned when the media reports the findings of the latest poll.</p>

<p>In 2012, for example, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/07/result-of-third-party-lawsuit-could-decide-outcome-of-2016-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approximately 90 percent of polls</a> did not include Gary Johnson or Green Party nominee <strong>Jill Stein</strong>. As a result, reports on presidential polls&nbsp;tended not to refer&nbsp;to these candidates – sometimes even&nbsp;<a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer">representing support for them as "other"</a>&nbsp;– keeping <a href="http://ajrarchive.org/Article.asp?id=5448" rel="noopener noreferrer">their exposure</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012#Results" rel="noopener noreferrer">electoral performances</a>&nbsp;minimal.</p>

<p>In May of this year, the trend seemed to continue. A senior editor for HuffPost Pollster, explaining why its site had not reported on the standing of Johnson in the polls, observed that of the 15 pollsters it tracked, only 3 had included him.</p>

<p>"The answer to why HuffPost Pollster isn’t including Johnson in our charts should be clear at this point," she&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-johnson-polls_us_574f0fdce4b0eb20fa0c6ba2" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>. "We can’t include him when pollsters aren’t polling on him."</p>

<p>In June, however, some polling organizations have started to be more inclusive.</p>

<p>On June 1, RealClearPolitics posted <a href="http://ballot-access.org/2016/06/01/major-polls-begin-including-johnson-and-stein/#comment-251414" rel="noopener noreferrer">two polls</a>&nbsp;measuring public opinion in Georgia. Both Quinnipiac and Public Policy Polling (PPP) included Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein as options (Stein is currently not the party's nominee: the Green Party will select its nominee in August).</p>

<p>Since then, this practice has continued, at both the state and national levels. On June 7, PPP released the results from a poll in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5963.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida</a> that included&nbsp;Clinton, Trump, Johnson, and Stein, and Quinnipiac published its results of a four-candidate survey in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ct/connecticut_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5959.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecticut</a>. The next day, PPP published the results of a poll in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5964.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pennsylvania</a> that also included all four candidates.</p>

<p>On June 12, SurveyUSA <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/SUSA_June_2016_National.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> a national four-way poll for <em>The Guardian</em>, and on June 16, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/Reuters_Ipsos_June_11th_to_15th_2016.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters/Ipsos</a> followed suit. Also that&nbsp;day,&nbsp;PPP&nbsp;released&nbsp;the results of&nbsp;a four-candidate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_VA_61616.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll in&nbsp;Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>As <strong>Michael Barone</strong> has <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/voters-may-be-fleeing-both-major-party-candidates/article/2594257" rel="noopener noreferrer">observed</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>Washington Examiner</em>, the results have been fairly modest for Johnson and Stein. In three-way contests involving Clinton, Trump, and Johnson, Johnson has polled 8 percent on average, drawing equally from Clinton and Trump. When Stein has been&nbsp;included, Johnson's support has fallen to 5 percent, with Stein winning 3 percent.</p>

<p>Yet Barone also notes that the support for Johnson and Stein may represent&nbsp;something significant: "potential flight." Given the unpopularity of Clinton and Trump, many voters are considering alternatives, or may in the end decide not to vote at all.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Johnson and Stein can be expected to monitor closely the effects of increased exposure as a result of being included&nbsp;in presidential polling. Perhaps one of them – or both – may hit the 15 percent threshold and be invited to participate in the CPD debates, which <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates" rel="noopener noreferrer">begin in September</a>.</p>
