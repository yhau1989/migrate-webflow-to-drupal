<p>The popularity of Cinco de Mayo has been growing in the recent years, celebrating Mexican culture and heritage, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations. But what is Cinco de Mayo?</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Cinco de Mayo is not the celebration of Mexico's Independence Day, which is on September 16.</p>

<p>Cinco de Mayo is actually the celebration of the victory of Mexican&nbsp;troops over the French army at the battle of Puebla in 1892. This was the first major victory by Mexico against France during the Franco-Mexican War (1861-1867).&nbsp;Today, Cinco de Mayo is used to promote Mexican culture and celebrate&nbsp;prominent figures of Mexican descent in the United States such as Cesar Chavez, the famous farmers' rights activist.</p>

<p>The day is usually celebrated with mexican food, margaritas, and mariachi bands.</p>
