<p>On Tuesday, Pennsylvania held primary elections where voters could choose either a Democrat or Republican candidate who would then proceed to the November ballot in the state's municipal elections.</p>
[advertisement title=""] Like 17 other states, Pennsylvania has a closed primary system, meaning that only voters registered with the Democratic or Republican parties are allowed to vote. This system prevents over 1 million voters, who have registered as independent or with a minor party, from voting in the primary.

<p>However, like in all states, these partisan primary elections are ultimately funded by the taxpayers. For this year's primaries, the bill is estimated at <a href="http://tribune-democrat.com/local/x319991622/Independents-minor-party-members-locked-out-of-primary-election" rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million</a>. Although such a system has&nbsp;historically been the status quo, a growing share of independents in the American electorate are now speaking out.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/05/primary_election_independents_excluded_unconstitutional.html#incart_river" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Zencey</a>, a writer for&nbsp;Pennlive and The Patriot-News, published a piece in which he argues that the closed primary system in Pennsylvania potentially violates the state's constitution:</p>
<blockquote>"Then there’s that whole “free and equal” elections thing in the Pennsylvania constitution. Although the courts have yet to consider the question, I believe that a taxpayer-funded election which excludes a particular class of duly registered voters is not “free and equal” under Pennsylvania’s constitution."</blockquote>
<p>More ideas to address this issue are currently being discussed. State Sen. Rob Teplitz supports a bill that would allow independents to register with one of the two main parties in order to vote in the primary before reverting to their original status. Yet, this remains a cumbersome process that would still not offer true equality to voters not registered with the two main parties, leaving many non-party affiliated voters feeling separate, but equal.</p>

<p>Matt Zencey and <a href="http://tribune-democrat.com/local/x319991622/Independents-minor-party-members-locked-out-of-primary-election" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Bullock</a>, founder of Independent Pennsylvanians, both consider the nonpartisan top-two open primary a likely solution to the issue. A third solution, evoked by <a href="http://tribune-democrat.com/local/x319991622/Independents-minor-party-members-locked-out-of-primary-election" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Kauffman</a> from Common Cause,&nbsp;could be to make the parties pay for their primaries.</p>
