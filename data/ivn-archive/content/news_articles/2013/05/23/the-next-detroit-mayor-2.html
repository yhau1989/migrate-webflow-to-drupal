<p><span>Last week, current Detroit Mayor&nbsp;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Bing" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Dave Bing">Dave Bing</a><span>&nbsp;announced he would not seek re-election for the&nbsp;post he has held since 2009. This opened up what would already have been a very interesting election. </span></p>

<p><span>A total of nineteen people have filed to take part in the primary election on August 6. Although the mayoral race is technically nonpartisan, a Democrat has held the seat since&nbsp;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_mayor" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Detroit Mayors">1962</a><span>. The top two vote netters from the primary </span><span>will then face-off on November 5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Of course, there has already been some controversy as one of the high-profile candidates has had his&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;challenged. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duggan" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mike Duggan">Mike Duggan</a>,&nbsp;the&nbsp;former CEO of the Detroit&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;Center, faced a challenge to the&nbsp;residency&nbsp;requirements that candidates must abide by.</p>

<p>On May 23, the Detroit Election Commission voted 2-1 in favor of allowing Duggan to stay on&nbsp;the&nbsp;ballot. According to early poll numbers, Duggan is the preliminary favorite in the race... although there is a long way to go. If successful, Duggan would be the first white mayor of Detroit in <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/03/04/mike-duggan-a-white-candidate-for-gasp-detroit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mike Duggan: A White Candidate For (Gasp!) Detroit">40 years</a>.</p>

<p>The next mayor of Detroit, whether Duggan or someone else, will face an interesting&nbsp;situation&nbsp;upon taking office. Detroit, due to budget woes almost beyond comprehension, has had a state appointed emergency manger in place to help sort out their budget mess.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;the&nbsp;first nine months of their term,&nbsp;the&nbsp;next Detroit mayor will almost be a&nbsp;second&nbsp;in command when it comes to any fiscal decision-making. This could somewhat serve as&nbsp;insulation&nbsp;for the mayor with what will&nbsp;likely&nbsp;be some&nbsp;unpleasant&nbsp;decisions that the citizens of Detroit will be faced with.</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp;emergency&nbsp;manager's <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130512/NEWS01/305120168/kevyn-orr-highlights-report-45-day-city-financial-crisis-emergency-manager" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="9 highlights of Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr's report to the state">report </a>earlier this month, almost every department in&nbsp;the&nbsp;city needs to be overhauled.</p>

<p>Regardless of who wins the election in November, they have a huge job ahead of them.&nbsp;While&nbsp;it may seem that much of the nation doesn't expect much from Detroit, aside from cars, Michigan and&nbsp;the&nbsp;rest of the region would benefit greatly by Detroit taking steps towards economic health.</p>
