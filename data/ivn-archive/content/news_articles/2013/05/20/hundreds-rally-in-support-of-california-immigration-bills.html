<p>Last week, Assembly Bill 4, also known as the "<a href="http://ivn.us/california/2013/05/17/ab-4-makes-it-harder-to-deport-undocumented-immigrants/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trust Act</a>," passed the California State Assembly in a mostly party-line vote. The bill, authored by Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), was rejected by all Republican members of the Assembly, but only received two no votes from the other side of the aisle.</p>

<p>The Trust Act would place restrictions on local law enforcement on what crimes they are allowed to report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if the suspect is in the country illegally. If passed, the measure will have a major impact on federal deportation efforts as ICE officials rely on the help of city police.</p>

<p>Advocates argue the bill is necessary because, under current law, immigrants could be reported for frivolous crimes and that would break up families and hurt communities. Supporters of the bill further argue that current law discourages people -- specifically immigrants -- from reporting crimes out of fear of deportation.</p>

<p>Support for AB 4 is not small and hundreds of advocates of this bill, and other pieces of legislation currently being considered in the California Legislature that would expand immigration rights in the state, converged on Sacramento on Monday for 17th annual <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/political/la-me-pc-immigrant-day-20130520,0,5030249.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immigration Day</a>.</p>

<p>About 500 immigrants met with lawmakers to discuss a handful of bills and the issue of immigration in California.</p>

<p>Along with the Trust Act, advocates also voiced their support for another bill by Ammiano, AB 241, which would provide workplace protections for domestic workers. The "California Domestic Workers Bill of Rights" is currently being considered in the Appropriations Committee. .</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/2013/01/16/california-bill-would-allow-driver-licenses-for-illegal-immigrants/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AB 60</a> is also on the list of bills advocates support. If passed, the will give more unlawful immigrants an opportunity at receiving a state driver's license if the person wanting a license can show proof they have paid taxes.The passed the Committee on Transportation back in April and is also being considered by Appropriations.</p>
