<p>The United States uses more oil than any other country in the world, consuming more than 18.5 million barrels a day. Despite important resources in its soil, the U.S. remains dependent on foreign oil.</p>

<p>In 2011, 45 percent of the crude oil and&nbsp;petroleum&nbsp;products consumed in the United States were imported. The main oil exporters to the United States are Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico,&nbsp;Venezuela, and Nigeria.</p>

<p>However, with the exploitation of huge shale gas formations in North Dakota, Texas, and potentially California, U.S. domestic&nbsp;production&nbsp;is expected to rise sharply in the coming years. By 2014, the U.S. dependence on foreign oil could be reduced to 33 percent.</p>

<p>The exploitation of this unconventional oil is extremely costly and is only profitable as long as the price of oil remains really high. Moreover, the techniques used to extract unconventional oil are more contested because of their strong impact on the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Considering these elements, do you think the United States will be able to reduce its dependency on foreign oil?&nbsp;</strong></p>
