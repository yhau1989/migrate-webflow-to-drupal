<p>Memorial Day is America's second favorite day for grilling after the 4th of July. But, why we celebrate Memorial Day is much more than just a day for BBQ and sales.</p>

<p>Memorial Day was established in 1868 to honor those who died during the Civil War. It was&nbsp;originally&nbsp;called Decoration Day because people decorated soldiers graves.The holiday&nbsp;has since been extended to honor all Americans who died in military service.</p>

<p>In 1968, Memorial Day became a national holiday and its date was changed from May 30 to the last Monday of May to create a three-day weekend.</p>
