<p>Florida Independent Voting.Org’s (FIV) BLOG on Florida legislation benefited greatly from the civil, thoughtful and well-reasoned comments and responses to each other.&nbsp; It’s a joy to read comments from people with a brain that can express themselves with logic rather than anger and rote ideologies.&nbsp; Thanks very much!&nbsp; When the FIV movement began, we all had reservations and ideas to “make it better”.&nbsp; The following comments are offered as additional food for thought.&nbsp; Let’s keep the dialogue going!</p>

<p><b>Grassroots Campaigns</b><b>:&nbsp;</b>A true grassroots campaign, according to what I’m told, is almost always short on money and probably name recognition as well.&nbsp; A grassroots candidate can make up for not being a major party candidate by efficient use of time and hard work of a volunteer base.&nbsp; The grassroots candidate needs the time before AND after a primary to become known and viable in the general election.&nbsp; Typically a primary is followed by the general election in two-three months.&nbsp; Florida has its primary in August giving the underdog candidate less than three months to make his/her case.&nbsp; If the candidate only surfaces between primary and general elections, the advantage goes to the well-financed better-known candidate.</p>

<p><b>Survival</b>: Michael Higham raises two very helpful points.&nbsp; First, Top 2 isn’t about independent candidates.&nbsp; It is about finding the best candidate regardless of party affiliation or no party affiliation.&nbsp; One premise of Top 2 is that all candidates will need to appeal to a much broader base and, therefore, not represent the usual extremes of one party or another.&nbsp; Second, surviving a Top 2 primary makes the underdog more competitive in a one-on-one race.&nbsp; One of the strategies in Texas No Limit Poker is to eliminate the competition early in a hand and only have to deal with one opponent.&nbsp; Not a bad strategy for a candidate for office?</p>

<p><b>Money! Money! Money</b>!&nbsp; We need campaign finance reform, period! The IRS did a very dumb thing in targeting conservative 501c4 organizations but the underlying motive may have been pure.&nbsp; A 501c4 can’t devote more than half its time in political activism and be legal.&nbsp; It does matter whether what the IRS did was legal or not despite the incredibly dumb comment by Dan Pfeiffer, President Obama’s spin doctor.&nbsp; What matter much, much more is having the guts to change the system from inside!&nbsp; The Catch 22 we face is that the current US Congressional and Florida Legislative incumbents will never allow meaningful campaign finance reform.&nbsp; We need to elect individuals that aren’t owned by corporations or wealthy individuals.</p>

<p><b>Build The Government Voters Deserve</b>: A group named Represent Us&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://represent.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://represent.us/</a>&nbsp;is pursuing legislation titled “The American Anti-Corruption Act”.&nbsp; Trevor Potter (Former FEC Commissioner and Steven Colbert Super PAC lawyer) is one of the authors of the legislation.&nbsp; A group named Move To Amend&nbsp;<a href="https://movetoamend.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://movetoamend.org/</a>&nbsp;is pursuing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.&nbsp; Top 2 is a building block to complement these movements.&nbsp; We need to build a better government brick-by-brick.<b></b></p>

<p><b>More Candidates</b>:&nbsp; Regarding Top 3 or 4, FIV simply wanted to stay within the construct of Washington and California Top 2 laws to hopefully reduce or eliminate future court challenges.&nbsp; Some would argue for instant runoff as well.&nbsp; If one assumes a close race to be &lt;6% difference between the second and third place candidates in a Primary Election, Washington State only had 7% of the total 400 races (US Congressional and State/Senate/Representatives) spanning 2008 – 2012 that were close.</p>

<p>Kevin, your point about voter turnout is certainly valid regarding Top 2 and candidate selection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>FIV believes Top 2 requires a culture change which means time must pass</b>.&nbsp; We are working on a set of metrics based on Washington States Top 2 election history from 2008 through 2012.&nbsp; The bottom line to voter apathy is grassroots organizing and large doses of perseverance.&nbsp; One of the often cited reasons for not voting in a primary is that there is no real differentiation between candidates.&nbsp; We are early in the life of Top 2.&nbsp; We need to give it some time.&nbsp; Higher quality candidates can boost turnout.&nbsp;&nbsp; See below for a peak at Florida compared to California and Washington State turnout.&nbsp; Turnout is a problem that we collectively need to address.</p>

<p>The BLOG comments provided by IVN members highlight the difficulties of finding that perfect solution to election system reform.&nbsp; FIV encourages every Floridian to spread the word and seek support for a constitutional amendment to make our election system something to be proud of.</p>
