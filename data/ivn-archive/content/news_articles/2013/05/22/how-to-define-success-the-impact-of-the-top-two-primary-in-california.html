[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Last week, the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) invited Professor Gabriel Lenz to discuss his study on the impact of the top-two primary system in California. As a result of focusing solely on the election of more moderate candidates, the study does not offer a clear understanding of the consequences of the top-two primary.

<p>The <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/03/27/can-californias-new-primary-reduce-polarization-maybe-not/" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> by Professor Lenz and the&nbsp;University of California, Berkeleyâ€™s Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) is trying to answer one question: Does the top-two primary help moderate candidates? The experiment was conducted during the June primaries with 2839 voters in districts where moderate candidates faced extreme candidates.</p>

<p>At this stage of&nbsp;completion, the <a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/workshops/political-methodology-workshop/methods-workshop-gabriel-lenz" rel="noopener noreferrer">result</a> of the experiment is that moderate candidates do not perform better under the top-two primary system than they did under the closed one. One of the main reasons for this result is most voters failed to distinguish extreme candidates from moderate ones.</p>

<p>The results of this study, one of the only ones conducted during the 2012 elections, will likely please opponents of the top-two primary and fuel their arguments that Proposition 14 is a failure. However, before taking this result for granted, it is important to understand the limits inherent to studies such as this one.</p>

<p>The IGS study only recorded voter behavior during the 2012 June primaries and was focused on one issue: the election of moderate candidates. By its nature, the study is unable to grasp the impact of the top-two primary in its entirety.</p>

<p>First, by only looking at the June 2012 primaries, the study did not take into account the election of a number of <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/02/15/new-electoral-system-in-ca-means-more-competitive-races-data-reveals/" rel="noopener noreferrer">moderate candidates</a> in the November elections. A number of intra-party races ended in the favor of the more moderate candidate.</p>

<p>Despite most of these candidates finishing second in their primaries, they managed to appeal to a broader audience in the general election. This led, for example, to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/06/first-big-victory-for-open-primary-pete-stark-headed-for-defeat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric&nbsp;Swalwell</a>'s victory over long-time incumbent Pete Stark and Marc Levine's win over <a href="http://www.calbuzz.com/2013/05/top-two-politics-biz-plots-back-stories-backbiting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Allen</a>, an incumbent who had the support of the Speaker of the Assembly.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The supporters of 'top-two' also strongly believe the primary system will introduce much needed competition in state elections." author="Lucas Eaves"]Second, while it is true that electing more moderate candidates was one of the major arguments made in favor of the top-two primary, it was not the only one.&nbsp;Judging&nbsp;the success of the top-two primary only in the light of that criteria doesn't reveal the big picture.

<p>Proponents of the top-two primary believe it is truly important for the democratic process to offer&nbsp;equal ballot access to everybody, regardless of party affiliation. This is a goal that cannot be measured with numbers, but is achieved simply by the use of the open, nonpartisan format.</p>

<p>The supporters of "top-two" also strongly believe the primary system will introduce much needed competition in state elections. The nonpartisan primary system, combined with independent redistricting, resulted in California having the <a href="http://ivn.us/editors-blog/2012/09/14/california-with-most-competitive-elections-in-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer">most competitive</a> elections in the country in 2012.</p>

<p>More importantly, in a state clearly dominated by the Democrats, the top-two primary has allowed a new type of competition to emerge: intra-party competition. While nobody can expect the Republicans to retake the upper hand in California&nbsp;anytime soon, increased competition among Democrats has the potential to significantly impact the state's political landscape.</p>

<p>For the upcoming 2014 elections, <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2013/05/16/calling-for-silicon-valley-to-change-politics-dem-house-candidate-ro-khanna-draws-tech-stars-to-sf-fundraiser/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ro Khanna</a>, former&nbsp;Assistant Commerce Secretary and supported by Silicon Valley, is already challenging seven-term congressman Mike Honda, who is supported by President Obama, Nancy Polosi, and the whole Democratic establishment. More competitive races like this are expected to emerge within the next year.</p>

<p>A few more election cycles will be needed to evaluate the true impact "top-two" has on California, but it would be denial to believe that nothing has changed.</p>
