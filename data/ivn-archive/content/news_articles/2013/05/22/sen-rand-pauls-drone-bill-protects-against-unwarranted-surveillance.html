<p>On a day when much of the media is talking about governmental surveillance and abuse, Senator Rand Paul introduced the Preserving Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act of 2013. If passed, the act would protect civilians against unwarranted govenrment intrusion through the use of drone technology.</p>

<p>"The use of drone surveillance may work on the battlefields overseas, but it isn't well-suited for unrestrained use on the streets in the United States. Congress must be vigilant in providing oversight to the use of this technology and protection for rights of the American people. I will continue the fight to protect and uphold our Fourth Amendment," Sen. Paul said in a press release.</p>

<p>Paul previously expressed constitutional concerns with drone policy in his historic filibuster, in which he warned against the potential dangers of domestic drone strikes. Paul has been&nbsp;adamant&nbsp;about the need for due process in drone policy,&nbsp;and includes in his bill that "no evidence obtained or collected in violation of this Act can be used/admissible as evidence in a criminal, civil, or regulatory action."</p>

<p>Rand Paul's drone bill cites three permissible situations that would allow for unwarranted surveillance: border patrol, situations where there is imminent danger to life, or if there is a high risk of terrorism.</p>
