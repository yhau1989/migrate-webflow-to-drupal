<p>The <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/05/08/obama-maintains-approval-advantage-but-gop-runs-even-on-key-issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center</a> released a new public opinion poll and it shows a disparity between how the American people perceive the actions of the Presidency and the Congress. The poll also shows public perception of the two branches as being uncooperative.</p>

<p>President Obama's job remains approved by a majority of Americans (51 percent) while both Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress have less than a one-third approval rating. Republican leaders, with 22 percent job approval rating, the lowest rate for congressional leaders from either party in 20 years.</p>

<p>Despite having their actions disapproved in general, the Republicans in Congress are considered to do a better job, or as good of a job, than Democrats on three major issues: economy, immigration and gun control.</p>
<p>However, 80 percent of Americans believe that Obama and Republican leaders are not working together, up from 65 percent in February 2011. Forty-two percent believe that Republicans are to blame rather than Obama (22 percent).</p>

<p>The study also shows that most Americans say that Obama stands up for what he believes in (76 percent), that he fights hard to pass his policies (67 percent) but only 49 percent think he is able to get things done.</p>
