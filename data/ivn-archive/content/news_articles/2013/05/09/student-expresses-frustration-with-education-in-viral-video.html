<p>The following video is making its way around the internet as we speak. A student expresses frustration with how his teacher shows a lack of commitment to engaging with students. It is said to take place at a public high school in Duncanville, Texas.</p>

<p><em>"If you would just get up and teach instead of giving them a packet. There's kids in here that don't learn like that, they need to learn face-to-face."</em></p>

<p><em>"You want kids to come into your class, you want them to get excited for this? You got to come in here and make them excited. You want a kid to change and start doing better? You have to touch his heart. You can't expect a kid to change if you just 'tell them'."</em></p>

<p>The student is right in many regards. Handing out packets and expecting students to learn from filling out answers after reading a textbook is probably not the most effective way to teach. He and his classmates are the ones being short-changed by the underwhelming education.</p>

<p>But viewers shouldn't be quick to attack the teacher from this class. Maybe she was having a bad week, or feels confined by curriculum standards. Who knows? Her response, or lack thereof, to the student's comments can be telling, though.</p>

<p>If the student felt the need to finally voice his opinion, the frustration with education in the classroom may have been going on for a while.</p>

<p><strong>How would you respond to the student frustration with education? What else should be considered when watching the video? Let us know in the comments.</strong></p>
