<p>While his son, Senator Rand Paul, has taken most of the national spotlight away from his father, Ron Paul has not stopped advancing his "<a href="http://www.campaignforliberty.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Campaign for Liberty</a>." Ron Paul and his supporters have built up a massive database of "liberty loving" supporters since the organization launched in 2008, following his second unsuccessful campaign for the Presidency. And today, he is robo-calling his supporters to <a href="http://www.chooseliberty.org/nationalidcard.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign a petition</a> against the inclusion of a National ID card in immigration reform negotiations. From the petition:</p>
<blockquote>Right now, freedom-stealing Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), banding together with other statists from both parties, are scheming to sneak a massive power grab into a new "immigration reform" bill.

<span>If passed, it would require every American to obtain a National ID card to work legally in the U.S. - and you can bet it will be only a matter of time until they're required even for simple purchases</span>.</blockquote>
<p>Ron Paul calls the current proposals "by far the worst national ID card the statists have come up with yet.” And he blames the "Gang of 8," which includes Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Chuck Schumer, for working with Obama to "sneak a national ID" into an immigration reform bill. &nbsp;"A statist's dream,” Paul decries.</p>

According to Paul, the national ID would create a new federal database with biometric information on all citizens and those who work within the United States. He claims that, in short time, it would be illegal for anyone to have a job without an ID card. "Every time any citizen applies for a job, the government will know...[and]&nbsp;once the government&nbsp;bureaucrats&nbsp;know exactly how we run our lives, they will try and control them."

<p>He warns that "the government will know what you eat, drink, and read. Once they know this information, they will regulate everything" from your food to your education, depriving us of our freedom.&nbsp;<span>Issues like amnesty are just being used as cover. The National ID is what the "statists" really want.</span></p>
