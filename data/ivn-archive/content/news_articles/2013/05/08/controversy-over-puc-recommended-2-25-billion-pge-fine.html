<p>Major newspapers are covering a recommendation by the California Public Utilities Commission to fine PG&amp;E over $2.25 billion for negligence that led to a&nbsp;catastrophic&nbsp;gas explosion in San Bruno in 2010. Most outlets have taken the angle that PG&amp;E deserves the enormous award for "decades of negligence." &nbsp;<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/calif-agency-says-pg-e-205017803.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bruno-explosion-20130506,0,1062469" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323687604578467293475230014.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/State-Fining-PG-amp-E-does-not-make-sense-4492767.php#ixzz2SeoRfgOE" rel="noopener noreferrer">San&nbsp;Francisco Chronicle</a>&nbsp;took another side, raising a some good points: the money should be used to increase safety, not simply to punish PG&amp;E.</p>
<blockquote>The fines proposed by San Bruno and The Utility Reform Network would not threaten PG&amp;E's stability, Earley said. But by increasing the cost and difficulty of raising capital, it could slow the speed of pipeline repairs and upgrades.</blockquote>
<p>IVN will be following up on this story later this week.</p>
