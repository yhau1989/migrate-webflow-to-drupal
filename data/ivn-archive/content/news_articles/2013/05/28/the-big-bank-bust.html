<p><strong>The Lessons We Didn't Learn</strong></p>

<p>The stock market has been on a tear lately. &nbsp;It has been setting new records right and left. &nbsp;And not just the NYSE, but also Nasdaq and the S&amp;P. &nbsp;Even unemployment is slowly dropping as jobs are slowing coming back. &nbsp;By a mere look, our economy seems to be improving. &nbsp;But looks can be deceiving. &nbsp;With the stock market doing so well, businesses are making record profits but still hiring people, creating jobs, and even borrowing still struggle. &nbsp;We have managed to make our way through a housing collapse and a banking collapse which brought on what is termed "The Great Recession," but could we possibly be laying the seeds for the next one? &nbsp;And could it be even worse than this last one?</p>

<p><img alt="11927816-bank-runs" height="198" src="cloudinary://11927816-bank-runs-250x198.jpg" width="250">The banks are the main focus of this part piece since they are essentially the foundation of the economy. &nbsp;In 2008, the banking industry collapsed (as a result of the housing market collapse). &nbsp;Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008 since no other bank was interested in buying up its assets. &nbsp;But the dominoes were already starting to fall. &nbsp;Other big banks started declaring that they, too, had bad assets and were on the verge of bankruptcy. &nbsp;The Bush administration (with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson) and the Democrats that were controlling Congress came up with TARP (the Troubled Assets Relief Program). &nbsp;TARP, which was part of the larger Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, was designed for the government to buy up assets and equity and strengthen the financial system. &nbsp;The EESA was designed to provide the banks the funds they would need to operate and not go into bankruptcy. &nbsp;The banks were deemed "too big to fail," and the economy would not be able to sustain a hit if all the major banks went bankrupt the same way Lehman Brothers did. &nbsp;The funding came from the taxpayers and was set at $700-billion. &nbsp;(This would later be reduced by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to $475-billion. &nbsp;The Congressional Budget Office announced in October 2012 that total disbursements would be $431-billion.) &nbsp;Taxpayers were not too pleased by this move since they were footing the bill and the banks were still foreclosing on their houses and weren't giving them any assistance. &nbsp;Even the federal government wasn't doing much to assist the average taxpayers. &nbsp;The argument in favor though was that, again, the economy would get even worse (possibly to a depression level) if all the banks failed at once. &nbsp;The easy solution in this was to buy time so that the banks could shore themselves up and then get to a more manageable size. &nbsp;The problem is that this easy solution never happened.</p>

<p><img alt="bank-failure" height="170" src="cloudinary://bank-failure-250x170.jpg" width="250">Instead of the big banks being busted up into a size more manageable and able to go bankrupt without bringing down the entire economy, they only got bigger. &nbsp;JPMorgan Chase would buy Bear Stearns, Bank of America would buy up Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo would buy Wachovia. &nbsp;<em>(NOTE: This is just a small sample and not a complete list.)</em>&nbsp; So the banks that were too big to fail before are even bigger now. &nbsp;And in a real smack to taxpayers, and largely unknown to them as well,&nbsp;the bailouts are still happening. &nbsp;In February of this year, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/business/dont-blink-or-youll-miss-another-bank-bailout.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;smid=fb-share&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>&nbsp;reported on a secret deal struck in July 2012 between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bank of America.&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't mean that Congress hasn't made any attempt at all to break the banks up. &nbsp;In January, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) wrote legislation that would have the Government Accountability Office study whether banks with more than $500-billion in assets require an economic benefit. &nbsp;This legislation passed unanimously in the Senate. &nbsp;It even earned the praise of conservative columnist George Will, who wrote in the &nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-will-break-up-the-big-banks/2013/02/08/2379498a-714e-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html?tid=pm_opinions_pop" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>&nbsp;that conservatives should be on board not only with that legislation but also with the proposal that the two Senators were teaming up on to bust up the big banks. &nbsp;When a bank goes bankrupt (yes, there is irony ), it should not be able to bring down all the other banks and the entire economy. &nbsp;In 1995, the largest 6 banks had combined assets that were 16-percent of GDP. &nbsp;Today, that number is 64-65-percent of GDP.</p>

<p>In 2012, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, was summoned before Congress after it was reported that the bank had lost $2-billion in "risky" trading in May. &nbsp;Early reports were denied and minimized in an attempt to minimize exposure. &nbsp;JPMorgan Chase had accepted taxpayer bailout money from TARP, afterall. &nbsp;By July 2012, the amount was upgraded to $4.4-billion and the bank was still continuing to lose money on the bad hedge fund investments. &nbsp;The ordeal is still under investigation by the FBI, SEC, and the Federal Reserve. &nbsp;But it still goes to show how little these big banks (and their CEO's) actually care for the US taxpayers and the economy as a whole. &nbsp;They are continuing to make risky investments, and then they will expect us to bail them out should things go sour once again.</p>

<p>During the recession, the people learned many things. &nbsp;We learned to do without certain things and make cut backs where we could; we learned not to buy things that we probably couldn't afford; and we learned to save up whenever it was possible. &nbsp;We have redefined ourselves. &nbsp;Yet, as we have made these adaptions, the big banks have not. &nbsp;They are still making risky and bad investments. &nbsp;And though they are posting record profits (in the billions), they still are being quite frugal with credit. &nbsp;Part of the bailout was to help keep credit flowing so the economy could continue. &nbsp;Sadly, that part wasn't made a requirement for getting taxpayer bailout funds. &nbsp;And while the banks were too big to fail before, they have been allowed to get even bigger by our very government. &nbsp;Millions of people remain unemployed (and even more underemployed) because the economy is not growing by leaps and bounds that the stock market would have you believe as of late. &nbsp;We all know the lessons that should have been learned from the recession. &nbsp;And as we, the people, have taken note of them, the banks have only turned a blind eye. &nbsp;They are planting the seeds already for the next economic collapse almost on the exact same reason. &nbsp;The 4 big banks can manipulate the economy in any way that suits them. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it will again catch up with them, and it will be us, the taxpayers, that pay the ultimate price. &nbsp;It would even seem plausible that the next time could be even worse since we are less likely to allow the government to bail them out again with our tax dollars. &nbsp;The lessons need to be learned... both by the big banks and the government. &nbsp;It goes back to the old axiom, "Fool me once, shame on you. &nbsp;Fool me twice, shame on me."</p>
