<p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and drone policy have recently taken center stage among privacy advocates, with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) involvement in domestic drone use causing a stir among those both for and against the commercial use of drones within our borders.</p>

<p>While the FAA test sites have the potential to create thousands of jobs in a market that could quickly reach <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/04/26/civil-rights-groups-urge-faa-to-test-drone-surveillance-capacities/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$90 billion</a>, the potential for abuse remains high, leading civil liberties groups to advocate for the additional monitoring of surveillance capabilities to better prepare for privacy concerns in the future.</p>

<p>Lawmakers have also taken action. California State Assemblyman Jeff Gorell (R-Camarillo) and Assemblyman Steven Bradford (D-Gardena) introduced a bill to put restrictions on how law enforcement agencies' use drones.</p>

<p>"Our legislation clarifies how law enforcement and other public agencies will be allowed to use UAVs, and protects the public from unwarranted intrusions,‚Äù Gordell explained in a February <a href="http://arc.asm.ca.gov/member/AD44/?p=article&amp;sid=426&amp;id=254287" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>.</p>

<p>In light of the recent attention on domestic drone policy, proposed legislation, and the outpour of privacy concerns, IVN is hosting a tweet chat on <strong>Thursday, May 9, at 5pm PT </strong>on "Drone Policy &amp; Privacy," with the intention of fostering a constructive conversation on the potential benefits and dangers of using drones for commercial use and how these concerns should shape policy.</p>
