<p>Immigration reform and drones are among the most highly discussed issues in the country. For states bordering Mexico, the two issues are becoming one.</p>

<p>One of the major component of the immigration reform bill proposed by the "Gang of Eight" in Congress is increasing border&nbsp;security -- especially with Mexico. The bill allocates $6.5 billion to this goal, which would not only include the&nbsp;deployment&nbsp;of helicopter and horse patrol at the Southwest border region, but also a greater use of drones.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawandsoftware.com/bseoima/bseoima-senate-1106.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Article 1106</a> of the bill, titled "Equipement and Technology," provides:</p>
<blockquote>"ENHANCEMENTS.—The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, working through U.S. Border Patrol, shall—

<b>1. </b>deploy additional mobile, video, and agent-portable surveillance systems, and <b>unarmed,</b> unmanned aerial vehicles in the Southwest Border region as necessary to provide 24-hour operation and surveillance;

<b>2. </b>operate unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles along the Southern border for 24 hours per day and for 7 days per week;"</blockquote>
<p>Not only would the bill create 24/7 drone surveillance over the border region, but it defines the <a href="http://www.lawandsoftware.com/bseoima/bseoima-senate-1101.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern border region</a> as "the area in the United States that is within 100 miles of the Southern border."</p>

<p>This extensive definition would include major cities like San Diego, California; Tucson, Arizona; and the suburbs of Austin, Texas. Millions of people could be affected by the bill.</p>

<p>California Senator&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/politics/2013/05/13/13622/will-immigration-reform-mean-drones-over-southern/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dianne Feinstein</a> has called for an amendment that would reduce the geographic reach of drones. However, this concern is not shared by all senators and the amendment has been delayed for further discussion.</p>
