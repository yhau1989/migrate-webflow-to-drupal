<p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee unveiled a new advertisement Thursday, simply titled, "Yes." The ad features Senators Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) among others. The two prominent Republicans have become highly regarded within the party in recent months and their inclusion in the fundraising pitch is a warm sign from the party establishment.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rand Paul's clip promotes a nonpartisan appeal. Taken from the senator's speech at Howard University, Paul says, "You're more important than any political party. More important than any political pleadings or partisan pleadings."</p>

<p>In the minute and a half spot, the narrator makes the RNSC's case to the viewer:</p>
<blockquote>"I know things have been tough, but if you can believe it, we're working for you... It might not always seem like it, but we say yes a lot. We say yes on jobs for you."</blockquote>
<p>The ad also includes a soundbite from Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), who managed to <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/01/22/tight-senate-vote-to-reform-the-filibuster-draws-near/" rel="noopener noreferrer">filibuster</a> his own proposal in January regarding the debt ceiling.</p>

<p>At a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/it-might-finally-be-time-for-the-nuclear-option-in-the-senate/276377/" rel="noopener noreferrer">time</a> when the 'nuclear option' to reform the filibuster is being encouraged by members of the press, Senate Republicans are making a tough sell to constituents; especially since being labeled the 'Party of No' by Michael Grunwald of TIME magazine during the 2012 campaign. The label has yet to fade completely from the political ether of Washington.</p>

<p>Whether the ad is part of a larger, concerted effort to work across the aisle or merely a fresh coat of paint over the world's greatest deliberative body's fraying infrastructure remains to be seen. Congressional approval sits only 5 percent above its recent low of 10 percent.</p>

<p>Likewise, public approval for multiple swing-state Senators dropped considerably <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gun-control-votes-approval-ratings-poll-senators-2013-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">following</a> the failed gun control vote last month. Senate Republicans have significant ground to regain before 2014. It's up to voters to decide if they'll say 'yes' next November.</p>
