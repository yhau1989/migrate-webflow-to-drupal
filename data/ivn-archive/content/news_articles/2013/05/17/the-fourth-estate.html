<p><strong>Freedom Of The Press And National Security</strong></p>
<blockquote>"Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost." &nbsp;Thomas Jefferson~</blockquote>
<p>During the course of this past week, I've watched the story unfold of the raid on the Associated Press (AP) by the Department of Justice. &nbsp;The Justice Department obtained records for 20 different phone lines (both work and personal) from AP personnel. &nbsp;Under the law, when it comes to a media entity, the Justice Department is to give the media organization advanced notice of a warrant or subpoena unless it is felt that doing so would jeopardize the investigation. &nbsp;In this particular case, the AP was not given advanced noticed. &nbsp;So what in particular was the Justice Department looking for? &nbsp;They are investigating a leak in the department to the media. &nbsp;The investigation started after the AP ran a story last May about a counter-terrorism investigation in Yemen.</p>

<p><img alt="media-buy-NS_Newsflash" height="194" src="cloudinary://media-buy-NS_Newsflash-250x216.jpg" width="225">I'm not here to state that this is a scandal and that something illegal was done. &nbsp;This is for investigators to seek out and for Congress to question. &nbsp;Yes, we in the media have the right to question, as well. &nbsp;But these answers, along with all the factual information, have yet to be released. &nbsp;So it would be unwise to jump to any conclusions without all of the information that is needed to form an opinion on these instances. &nbsp;Congress has told the Obama administration repeatedly that it needs to stop the leaks of information related to national security. &nbsp;With the AP raid, however, Congress is not only calling into question its legality but also if the Justice Department went too far to stop the leaks. &nbsp;During a recent appearance on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Eric Holder (who had recused himself from the leak investigation prior to the raid at the AP) said the leaks warranted a strong response from the federal government. &nbsp;Some members of Congress, including Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) has said a media shield law would have been needed in this instance to prevent this from happening. &nbsp;Such a law has been proposed but has been defeated in the past. &nbsp;And as each congressman has stated this claim, they have not taken notice that in the particular piece of legislation, a national security investigation would have been exempt. &nbsp;Since 9/11, the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) have often made broad exceptions to the law in terms of national security.</p>
<blockquote>"The free press is the mother of all our liberties and of our progress under liberty." &nbsp;Adlai E. Stevenson~</blockquote>
<p>The Founding Fathers included within the First Amendment to the Constitution our right to freedom of the press. &nbsp;As each branch of government was a check on the others, the press was given the freedom to check on all of them and to make those answer to the public. &nbsp;State-run media only&nbsp;propagates&nbsp;the government's actions to make the public believe such actions and laws are necessary. &nbsp;The press of our new republic needed and required freedom from government censorship in order to keep the government in check rather than the people. &nbsp;Without the ability to know information... without the ability to question our elected leaders... then democracy can't survive or progress. &nbsp;It will just deteriorate into despotism. &nbsp;As stated in the Stevenson quote above, freedom of the press is essential to any democratic (or republican) form of government. &nbsp;The final say should always lie with the people, and the people have the right to be informed.</p>

<p>The raid at the AP does seem excessive. &nbsp;Surely, there were other ways to find out the necessary information. &nbsp;One of the biggest assets with our press is the ability to speak&nbsp;anonymously.&nbsp; Could people now fear that this is under threat? &nbsp;That their cover could be blown? &nbsp;Yes, we should not have leaks in regards to national security... unless there is wrongdoing. &nbsp;However, could this raid have a trickle down effect that could keep people from talking on any range of subjects? &nbsp;Without the ability to keep people's identity secret, the press would have a difficult time doing its job. &nbsp;In its quest to find a government leak, what else could the Justice Department uncover during its search of the phone records? &nbsp;Wouldn't that be classified under a privacy violation? &nbsp;In regards to a government leak, this is not the media's problem or responsibility. &nbsp;This is the responsibility of the government to find it on its own end. &nbsp;This does not mean that a journalist cannot be called in front of a grand jury if required to do so. &nbsp;In <em>Branzburg v. Hayes</em> (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did not protect a journalist the right to refuse a subpoena by a grand jury. &nbsp;However, this is a particular individual and not a raid of an office and obtaining information from several different journalists... both work related and private. &nbsp;Though the government did at least have a subpoena for the records, they still need to walk the fine line between national security and freedom of the press. &nbsp;They need to remember that that particular burden falls on them and not upon us. &nbsp;In the meantime, I shall continue to watch as this unfolds. &nbsp;The freedom of the press is vital to our society, to our government, and to our nation. &nbsp;We cannot allow it to be trampled on.</p>
