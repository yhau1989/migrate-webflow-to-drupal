<p>Despite being the most commonly used drug in the United States, with over 100 million Americans admitting to trying marijuana a least once, marijuana laws affect hundreds of thousands of people negatively every year.</p>

<p>In 2009, 858,000 people were arrested for marijuana-related offenses and in 88 percent of these arrests, the culprit was charged with possession only. In 2011, half of the 1.5 million arrests for drug-related&nbsp;offenses&nbsp;were for marijuana.</p>

<p>Not only are current marijuana policies affecting the hundreds of thousands of Americans who use marijuana, but these policies are costing an estimated $10 billion per year to the American taxpayers.</p>

<p>At a time when federal and state&nbsp;governments&nbsp;are cutting their budgets, should we reconsider marijuana policies?</p>
