[outset type="half"]  [/outset]Who isn’t tired of the infighting among opposing political parties and houses of Congress?&nbsp;The current proposed budget deal, which is likely to pass, is just a stepping stone to the next looming round of difficult decisions to be made -- or not made.<p><a href="http://www.falchuk2014.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="ivn-falchuk.v5" height="280" src="cloudinary://ivn-falchuk.v5.gif" width="336"></a></p>

<p>There is a new movement, called the C-Party, which seeks to fix hyper-partisanship in Washington.</p>
<h4><strong>"C" for Compromise</strong></h4>
<p>The only way our government can function is to get past the divisiveness which prevents any beneficial bill from being passed -- often from even being discussed.</p>
<h4><strong>"C" for Cooperation</strong></h4>
[social_link quote="Can we convince our elected lawmakers to work together for the common good?" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295632729" handle="CPartySolution" hashes=""] The American people would embrace such a position.
<h4><strong>"C" for Compassion, for Civility, for Common Ground</strong></h4>
We may not all agree on every issue; that’s not the American way. [social_link quote="Can we instead encourage our leaders to show some respect for the opposing views of others?" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295632729" handle="CPartySolution" hashes=""] The mean-spirited accusations and utter disregard for alternative viewpoints serve no redeemable purpose in running our country or facing the critical issues which lie ahead.

<p>We need our elected representatives to listen for elements of an opposing argument which they find they may actually agree with, and use this to build consensus.</p>
<h4><strong>"C" for Country</strong></h4>
<p>We are one America. We need to gather people from opposing sides of an issue -- liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans -- and talk, share ideas, debate, and seek common ground. In everyday life, there is no aisle which divides us. We remain united despite our different views and beliefs. Why can’t Congress rise above partisan politics and solve the problems we face for the good of the country?</p>

<p>Where in the constitution (another "C"?) does it say that our representatives must be true to their party first and the American people second? The idea of the C-Party is not aimed exclusively at Republicans or Democrats. Let’s begin by supporting and electing candidates from either party who will put their constituents first.</p>
<h4><strong>"C" for Consensus</strong></h4>
<p>No one wins when dysfunction prevails. Recent history of government shutdown and the threat of fiscal default clearly demonstrates this. But we can work together to prevent these and other undesirable effects of inaction. The current budget deal, while far from perfect, was a monumental step in the right direction. Representative Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray sought common ground and found it.</p>
<h4><strong>"C" for Courage, for Chutzpah</strong></h4>
<p>There is far too much pressure on our lawmakers to toe the party line. We need leaders who have the backbone to declare themselves to be above partisan politics and reach across the aisle on a regular basis, not just in times of crisis.</p>

<p>There is a chance to declare a bold new approach in our two-party system which is in dire need of refinement. The idea behind the C-Party is not a revolution or an attempt to create a separate third party. Instead, it represents just a simple shift in direction which can only result in positive change.</p>

<p>Our form of government needs to return to the days when it was seen as a beacon to the world, not the ineffectual and seemingly paralyzed entity into which it has transmuted. The C-Party movement can help restore our nation to a democracy in its truest meaning and initial intent.</p>
