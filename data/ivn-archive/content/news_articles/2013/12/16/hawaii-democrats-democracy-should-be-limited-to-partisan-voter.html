<p>Since 1980, Hawaii has opened up its primary system to allow all voters, regardless of party affiliation, to vote. However, earlier this year, the Democratic Party of Hawaii (DPH) <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/11/democratic-party-of-hawaii-files-lawsuit-to-close-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenged the state law</a>, asserting their First Amendment right of association:</p>
<blockquote>“The lawsuit isn’t about excluding voters, but ensuring Democrats are selected at the primary stage by those willing to identify as Democrats.” -&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante Carpenter, chairman of the DPH.</blockquote>
<p>In July, a Hawaii federal court <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/15/hawaii-democratic-party-fails-prove-open-primaries-unconstitutional/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled against the Democratic Party</a>, upholding the current Hawaii open primary law:</p>
<blockquote>“Secrecy of voting shall be preserved; provided that no person shall be required to declare a party preference or non-partisanship as a condition of voting in any primary or special primary election. Secrecy of voting and choice of political party affiliation or non-partisanship shall be preserved.”</blockquote>
[social_blockquote quote="Just 35 of next year's 435 congressional elections across the country will be competitive." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/2013/12/16/hawaii-democrats-democracy-should-be-limited-to-partisan-voter/" handle="ChadPeace" hashes="EndPartisanship"] But now, the Democratic Party -- a party that prides itself on inclusiveness -- has re-asserted its right to prevent nonpartisan voters from participating at the most critical stage of the election process: the primary.

<p>The legal constructs of the case are <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/22/how-do-primary-elections-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer">not as simple</a> as a "parties have the right of private association" v. "voters have a right to participate" argument would suggest. The issues here are more complex, requiring factual and legal considerations that are either overlooked or not even considered by the traditional media.</p>

<p>According to one analysis, just <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/25/just-35-of-435-elections-competitive-after-201-years-of-gerrymandering/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">35 of next year's 435 congressional elections</a> across the country will be "competitive." This means that in over 90% of congressional races, only the voters who participate in the majority parties' primary elections will have a meaningful vote because the candidate who wins that primary will&nbsp;<em>de facto</em> have won the entire race.</p>

[outset type="half"]&nbsp;[/outset]Beyond this gerrymandering problem, ballot access requirements, a public dialogue that revolves around Republican and Democratic primary winners, and a national electorate that self-identifies as independent more than either of the two major parties are all facts that we should consider.<p><img alt="onetwothree.v2" height="280" src="cloudinary://governor-cuomo-wants-publicly-funded-campaigns-new-york-46364.gif" width="336"></p>

<p>However, the party's First Amendment right to keep unwanted voters out of its primary is a compelling one. But, isn't the right of any voter to participate in our democracy without being forced to join a party equally or more compelling? Should voters have to choose between their own right of non-association and the right to participate? When a private group's right conflicts with a fundamental right of an individual, whose right should trump whom?</p>

<p>Our democratic, republican, and libertarian ideals would suggest that when taxpayers fund something, the rights of the individual taxpayer or voter should trump the right of any private organization.</p>

<p>But, that is not the position of the Hawaii Democratic Party.</p>
