<p>According to a report by the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/military-sex-assault-reports-jump-50-percent" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>, the number of sexual assaults reported in 2013 increased dramatically by 50 percent compared to 2012. The report highlights a serious problem in the military that has gone mostly under-reported in the mainstream media even though there were serious scandals and new legislation passed in Congress to protect the rights of victims and strip commanders of the authority to overturn jury convictions. Officials in the defense department say the news is an indicator that more victims are willing to come forward, which has been a major concern as assaulted military personnel have expressed fear about going to a superior officer about crimes committed against them.</p>
