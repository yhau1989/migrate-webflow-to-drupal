<p>Capitol Hill publication, The Hill, named freshman U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) 'Person of the Year.' Cruz, one of the runner-ups for TIME Person of the Year, arguably made the biggest impact in Congress and has not even served a full year of his first term.</p>

While public opinion on Cruz may be as polarized as the 113th Congress, in very few instances in American history has a freshman in Congress ruffled so many feathers. Usually freshmen, like in any institution, keep their head down and make every effort not to step on anyone's toes. [social_link quote="For Ted Cruz, kicking shins may be a better metaphor than stepping on toes." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295633718" handle="theshawng" hashes=""]

<p>Love him or hate him, Cruz was a major player in the government shutdown and has led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- colloquially known as Obamacare. In fact, while many freshman in Congress don't draw too much attention to themselves, it seems like Cruz looks for any opportunity he can to keep the spotlight on himself.</p>
