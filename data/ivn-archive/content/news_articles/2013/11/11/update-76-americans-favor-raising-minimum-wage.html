<p>Up 5 percentage points from March, 76% of Americans would vote in favor of raising the minimum wage to $9 per hour.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165794/americans-raising-minimum-wage.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll </a>comes shortly after a White House official confirmed President Obama's support for the&nbsp;Fair Minimum Wage Act, a bill introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) and widely supported by Democrats.</p>

<p>“The President has long supported raising the minimum wage so hardworking Americans can have a decent wage for a day’s works to support their families and make ends meet, and he supports the Harkin/Miller bill that accomplishes this important goal,” <a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/11/07/obama-supports-10-minimum-wage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official told TIME</a>.</p>

Of those polled, [social_link quote="76% of Independent voters supported raising the minimum wage to $9/hour" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295630444" handle="" hashes=""],&nbsp; the same percentage of Americans who support it as a whole.

<p>Minimum wage currently rests at $7.50 and is not adjusted for inflation. If it did keep up with inflation, the minimum wage would be about <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/14/why-we-should-raise-the-national-minimum-wage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$10.70</a>.</p>

<p>Those <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/15/why-we-should-not-raise-the-national-minimum-wage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed</a> to raising the minimum, however, argue that it wont actually reduce poverty, it could lead to less working hours, and it will have a detrimental impact on young Americans.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Would you support raising the minimum wage to $9 per hour? What about $10.10 per hour, as proposed in the Fair Minimum Wage Act?&nbsp;</em></strong></h2>
