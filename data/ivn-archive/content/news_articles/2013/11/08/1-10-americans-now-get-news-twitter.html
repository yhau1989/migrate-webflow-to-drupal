<p>Just days before Twitter's debut on Wall Street, Pew Research Center released a <a href="http://www.journalism.org/files/2013/11/Twitter-IPO-release-with-cover-page-new2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> outlining the role of news on Twitter and the demographic of Twitter news consumers.</p>

The key finding:&nbsp; [social_link quote="Nearly one-in-ten U.S. adults (8%) get news through Twitter. " hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295630172" handle="" hashes=""] Twitter users who consumer news on the social network tend to be <p><strong><em>young</em></strong>, <strong><em>educated</em></strong>, and using a <strong><em>mobile</em></strong> device to access the news.</p>
<p>[outset type="half"] <img alt="twitter_news_consumption" height="316" src="cloudinary://twitter_and_news.png" width="317">[/outset]The report comes shortly after Pew's release of a <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/06/10-ways-facebook-improving-way-get-news" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed analysis</a> of the role of news on Facebook, which finds Facebook news consumers to be higher in number, but not age.</p>
<p>Of those who receive news on Facebook, 34% are between the age of 18-29 year old. Almost half of Twitter news consumers - 45% - are young.</p>

<p>Pew's <i>Twitter News Consumers: Young, Mobile and Education</i> goes on to note that while attracting a highly educated audience, with four in ten Twitter news consumers having received a bachelor's degree, Twitter conversations do not represent public sentiment.</p>

<p>"During the 2012 presidential race, Republican candidate Ron Paul easily won the Twitter primary â€” 55% of the conversation about him was&nbsp;positive, with only 15% negative. Voters rendered a very different verdict," the report notes, referencing a previous Pew study on <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/03/06/twitter-vs-polls-how-to-best-measure-public-opinion/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reaction to Events</a>.</p>

<p>The main purpose of Twitter is to spread breaking news.</p>
