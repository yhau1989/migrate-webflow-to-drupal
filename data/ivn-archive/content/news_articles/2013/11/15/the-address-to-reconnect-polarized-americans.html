<p>A documentary project by Ken Burns and PBS, <em>The Address</em>, challenges Americans to rehearse and memorize one of the most iconic speeches in history, Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The documentary itself follows a middle school in Putney, Vermont, the Greenwood School, throughout the academic year as the students rehearse, memorize, and ultimately recite Lincoln's famous speech.</p>

<p>At a time when <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/13/congress-wont-job-1-chart/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> show that Congress has become increasingly polarized, this documentary comes as a much needed shot of nonpartisan nostalgia. Yet, even when polarized Americans fall victim to the allure of partisan politics, it's hard to forget the triumphs of generations past that united the country in the face of grave adversity.</p>

<p>Above, actor/comedian Louis C.K. sits down with sitcom legend Jerry Seinfeld for a reading. Below is the speech itself so you can see how much you are able to recite from memory after a quick read.</p>
