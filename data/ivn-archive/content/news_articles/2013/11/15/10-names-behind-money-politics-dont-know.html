<p>There are basically five ways for money to flow into politics; well, six if you include the revolving door -- oh wait -- there's also the spousal side door and family back door — so that makes seven. The following is a list of the top 10 individuals who donate to 527s, nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations with the primary purpose of influencing elections. Data was collected from the Center for Responsive Politics on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSecrets.org</a>, which supplies&nbsp;a wealth — pun intended — of information.</p>
