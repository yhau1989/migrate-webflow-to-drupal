[/outset]This just in: The 113th Congress could be the most unpopular congress ever, with&nbsp;Americans' approval of the way Congress is handling its job dropping to 9% - <p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165809/congressional-approval-sinks-record-low.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines" rel="noopener noreferrer">the lowest in Gallup's history</a>.</p>

<p>Solidifying what almost every American already knew, Gallup <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165809/congressional-approval-sinks-record-low.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:</p>

<p><em>"The government shutdown in October clearly didn't help Congress' image, and it appears that the impact of that incident may linger, given the record-low approval this month."</em></p>

<p>This is the same Congress that was reported to be the <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/17/report-finds-113th-congress-most-divided-in-history-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">most divided ever</a> back in July, and the same Congress that let partisanship get in the way of a functioning government back in October.</p>

<p>This is the same Congress that has <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/28/5-issues-voters-want-congress-to-make-progress-on-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stalled</a> on passing legislation on immigration reform, privacy, tax reform, and sequestration.</p>

<p>This is the same Congress that jeopardized veteran benefits during the government shutdown, yet sent an array of press releases stressing the importance of <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/11/congress-puts-partisanship-honoring-nations-veterans/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">honoring our veterans</a>.</p>

<p>And this is the same Congress that recently voted to <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/31/congress-reduces-workdays-2014-pay-cuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce the number of workdays</a>&nbsp;while maintaining a&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/09/history-of-congressional-salaries-compared-to-median-worker-wage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$174,000 salary</a>&nbsp;(while&nbsp;the median American household income at&nbsp;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/17/news/economy/poverty-income/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$51,017 a year</a> in 2012, with 15% of Americans living in poverty).</p>

<p>While over <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/151943/record-high-americans-identify-independents.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">40%</a> of Americans no longer identify with the Republican or Democratic party, <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/04/11/congress-is-not-representative-of-americas-diversity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">99.6%</a> of Congress does. So did we really need Gallup to tell us that something is wrong in the legislative branch?</p>
