[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Last week, both Illinois and Hawaii passed same-sex marriage making them the 15th and 16th states to do so. Overall, 2013 has been quite a year for the LGBT community. These last two states just seem to put the icing on the proverbial cake.

<p>It all comes on the heals of the 2012 election where voters in three states (Maine, Maryland, and Washington) approved same-sex marriage and rejected a ban on it in the state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>So, what has transpired during the year?</p>

<p>Rhode Island, Delaware, Minnesota, and New Jersey all legalized same-sex marriage. The first three were passed by the state legislatures while New Jersey was done through the New Jersey Superior Court (<em>Garden State Equality v. Dow</em>).</p>

<p>With 14-states and DC (this excludes Illinois and Hawaii), the total population living in the various states that have same-sex marriage is roughly 104-million (33% of the population). This number will increase with the two newest states being added into the mix.</p>

<p>In Colorado, civil unions were legalized in May. And starting in late August, several counties in New Mexico began issuing same-sex marriage licenses.</p>

<p>Currently, New Mexico has no statutes against gay marriage or in favor of them. There is currently a court case seeking clarification as to whether banning/denying same-sex marriage in the state would violate the state's constitution. The counties in New Mexico that began issuing the licenses did so after various court rulings.</p>

<p>Then there is California. In 2008, the legislature passed same-sex marriage. The law was quickly overturned by voters with Proposition 8 that same year, which was soon followed by a lengthy court battle over the issue.</p>

<p>Lower courts ruled that Prop. 8 was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court (<em>Perry v. Schwarzenegger</em>) ruled that the proponents didn't have ground to bring the suit and threw out the case leaving the ruling by the lower courts. California resumed same-sex marriages as a result.</p>

<p>It wasn't just on the state level where advancements were made. There were federal developments, as well, as another case made its way to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In June, the Supreme Court ruled that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was unconstitutional in&nbsp;<em>United States v. Windsor</em>. It made it to where the federal government would recognize same-sex marriages that are performed in states where it is legal.</p>

<p>The federal government then stepped up even more stating that even if a couple lived in a state that did not recognize same-sex marriage, those marriages would be recognized on the federal level so long as they were performed in a state where they are legal. Other parts of DOMA are now being argued in the courts, as well, especially where states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states where it is legal.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Over 1/3 of the US population lives in a state where gay marriage is legal." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295630320" handle="" hashes=""]So, what should we expect in the coming year?

<p>According to a Quinnipiac poll in September, 56 percent of adults (57% of registered voters) approve of same-sex marriage while 36 percent disapprove. Support for gay marriage has remained roughly constant through the year while those opposed have dropped slightly.</p>

<p>Even with these numbers, the push for equality may appear to slow down a bit, especially after the speed of progress during the last two years.</p>

<p>Why is this? So far, the movement has been getting same-sex marriage approved in various states that had no constitutional bans (the exception being Maine which overturned its ban in 2012).</p>

<p>So, either courts are going to have to throw out the state bans and rule them unconstitutional or voters are going to have to overturn them in an election.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, New Mexico has neither a ban in place or any laws supporting same-sex marriage. Other states to watch include Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and even Virginia and Arizona.</p>

<p>In each of those states, recent polls show a majority of the population supports same-sex marriage. Most of these states, however, have constitutional bans on same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is the only state listed above that does not have a constitutional ban. It only has a state statute which can be dealt with by the legislature.</p>

<p>In Oregon, there is already a movement underway to overturn its constitutional ban. It will be interesting to see if they push for it in the 2014 midterms or wait for the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/06/in-gay-marriage-debate-both-supporters-and-opponents-see-legal-recognition-as-inevitable/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research</a>, 72 percent of those asked (proponents and opponents) say that same-sex marriage is inevitable. This is up from 59 percent in 2004.</p>

<p>Even the southern state of South Carolina is starting to show some movement on this issue. In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/04/republicans-need-to-pay-attention-to-this-poll-on-gay-marriage-in-south-carolina/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winthrop University Poll</a>, 52 percent state that they do&nbsp;not&nbsp;approve of same-sex marriage. This may not seem very surprising, but the state did approve a constitutional ban in 2006 with 78 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Mitt Romney won the South Carolina in 2012 with 55 percent of the vote. It has a Republican governor, two Republican senators, a Republican-controlled legislature, and 6 out of 7 of its U.S. Representatives are Republican. The state is solidly red, but yet attitudes are changing to a slight degree.</p>

<p>The possible cause of this is that, according to a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/gay-marriage-support-hits-new-high-in-post-abc-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post-ABC News</a>&nbsp;poll, a majority of Republicans aged 18-49 approve of same-sex marriage. Even U.S. Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have stated they support same-sex marriage, and several more Republican Senators just voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).</p>

<p>The progress of gay rights in 2013 has been remarkable. There is still plenty of work to be done though. The next couple of election years (2014-2016) should still see great progress being made.</p>
