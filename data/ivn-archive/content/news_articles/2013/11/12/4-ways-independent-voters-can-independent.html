[article_highlights] [article_highlight title="Save independently" url="#finance"] [article_highlight title="Independent business practices" url="#trade"] [article_highlight title="Independent medical care" url="#healthcare"] [article_highlight title="Get independent news" url="#media"] [/article_highlights]&nbsp;<p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/independent-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent voters</a> like to do their thinking outside the narrow confines of false dichotomies and established paradigms. They don’t like their choices made for them, they’re weary of a debate that never seems to go anywhere, and they’re bored of the made-for-television drama that partisan politics has become.</p>

<p>But if you’re an Independent voter, you can declare your independence in other areas too.</p>

<p>Independent voters can also be:</p>

[anchor title="finance"]
<h2><strong>Independent Savers</strong></h2>
<p>Independent voters don’t have to save for the future using the same old dollar-denominated, two-party-approved, and Wall Street-administered investment vehicles that crashed and burned in 2008, and are continually subject to losses <a href="http://www.coinnews.net/tools/cpi-inflation-calculator/" rel="noopener noreferrer">from inflation</a>.*</p>

<p>Throughout US history, gold and silver bullion-- though they may not be very exciting nor offer a likely chance at massive returns-- have been reliably safe over the long run from dollar inflation and economic downturns.</p>

<p>Less risk-averse independents who want to protect their savings from the Fed’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/three-fed-policy-voters-signal-prolonged-easing-to-boost-growth.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">endless monetary expansion</a> and maybe even get <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/foreignstocks.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">some big returns</a> in the short term might turn their eyes toward investment in foreign stock markets.</p>

<p>The very adventurous and risk-taking independent might even take a look at the rapidly growing digital currency market, exemplified in recent news headlines by the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> boom.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Independent voters are bored of the made-for-TV drama partisan politics has become." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295630522" handle="" hashes=""] The potential upside? Back in 2009, one Norwegian man bought $27 worth of bitcoin on a whim and promptly forgot about it. Last month, after just four years, he discovered that his investment was <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/29/bitcoin-forgotten-currency-norway-oslo-home" rel="noopener noreferrer">now worth $866,000</a>.</p>

<p>The potential downside? It’s easy <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/dumb-mistakes-costly-bitcoin-losses/" rel="noopener noreferrer">to lose</a> a lot of bitcoin through “dumb mistakes” or in the sudden crashes that happen <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/02/bitcoin-price-takes-a-beating-after-silk-road-gets-busted/" rel="noopener noreferrer">now</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/04/bitcoin-crashes-losing-nearly-half-of-its-value-in-six-hours/" rel="noopener noreferrer">then</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Independent Traders</strong></h2>
<p>Want to be even more independent from the artificial confines of a financial system that the establishment has chosen for you? Saving isn’t the only economic activity with plenty of room for more independence.</p>

<p>The Internet is now making it possible for savvy, independent-minded <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/small-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer">businesses</a> to buy and sell goods and services without US dollars, or any cash at all -- and realize huge savings in the process.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2009/02/16/story7.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">When John Howie needed</a> $30,000 in decorative granite for his new restaurant in Seattle, he didn't try to stretch his cash. Howie used his account credit with Seattle barter group BizXchange to pay the granite company, which is also a BizX member.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2012/10/chef-john-howie-plans-new-bothell.html?s=image_gallery" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="451" src="cloudinary://_John_Howie_Seastar_Bellevue_600.jpg" width="600"></a></p>

<p>Howie will also gradually pay back some of the cost by allowing other BizX members to use their own barter accounts to pay for items in his restaurant and bar... like this delicious bowl of lobster macaroni and cheese:</p>

<p><a href="http://seastarrestaurant.com/Bellevue/Cookbook" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="448" src="cloudinary://Lobster_Mac_Cheese.JPG" width="336"></a></p>

<p>With offices in Seattle, Washington and Oakland, California, <a href="http://www.bizx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BizX</a> is an online marketplace for cashless transactions. It’s like a combination between Craigslist and <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/bitcoin.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a>, where buyers and sellers barter goods and services in exchange for credits that can be redeemed for other goods and services on BizX.</p>

<p>Online barter has become a booming market for the growing number of businesses that are short on cash but have plenty of unused capacity or inventory they’d like to sell.</p>

<p>BizX members include thousands of businesses around the world (see if you recognize a couple <a href="http://www.bizx.com/bizx-community/" rel="noopener noreferrer">from this list</a>), which <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/23/small-business-barter-entrepreneurs-finance-barter.html%20" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanged $50 million</a> worth of goods and services without cash in 2008. And that’s just one online barter company</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irta.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Reciprocal Trade Association</a> says that in 2012, its 85 member barter organizations facilitated cashless exchanges between over 400,000 companies worldwide, helping them to sell their excess business capacities and inventories for <a href="http://www.irta.com/index.php/about/modern-trade-barter" rel="noopener noreferrer">an estimated $12 billion</a> in previously lost and wasted revenues.</p>

<h2><strong>Independent Patients</strong></h2>
<p>Online bartering has also created a remarkable opportunity for patients and doctors to declare their independence from the frustrating health insurance regime.</p>

<p>Susan is a Virginia physician and a big fan of bluegrass. Mike is a Virginia music school director who bartered to trade her a fiddle and fiddle-playing lessons in exchange for medical services.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/oldfashioned_bartering_helps_p.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Cleveland.com article</a> about it with a picture of Susan and her new fiddle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/oldfashioned_bartering_helps_p.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="352" src="cloudinary://large_bartering-health.jpg" width="453"></a></p>

<p>From the same story: in 2008 a New Jersey man named Robert traded his web design skills in exchange for nearly $1,000 of dental work. Just a few days after posting the offer on Craigslist, he received a response from a dentist about an hour from his home.</p>

<p>In an increasingly expensive, confusing, and unpredictable market for health insurance and medical services, made only more so by the volatile political system, independents can find solace and savings outside the monolithic health care paradigm through this kind of health care bartering.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.itex.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITEX</a> Corp. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itex_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer">is another</a> booming West coast company with an online marketplace for cashless transactions. Here’s what <a href="http://www.itexinsandiego.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">their San Diego exchange</a> looks like. <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2009/02/16/story7.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">With 24,000 members</a> across the country in 2009, ITEX <a href="http://www.itex.com/AboutUs/InvestorRelations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">processes more than</a> $140 million a year in Gross Merchandise Value. And a big piece of that is health care services.</p>

<p>Health care trades on ITEX rose 45 percent in 2009 to an average of about <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/oldfashioned_bartering_helps_p.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 million every month</a> in health care bartering. ITEX spokesman Allen Zimmelman says, “Health care bartering has risen dramatically since the recession began, as people lose their health insurance and consumer spending drops.”</p>

<p>But independents don’t have to barter cashless goods and services to save money on health care. In fact, paying doctors in cash up front and merely shopping around online for the best deals on tests -- <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2007/07/31/paying-cash-for-health-care/" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this Lakewood, Colorado man</a> does -- can result in huge discounts and savings while sticking it to the insurance companies.</p>

<h2><strong>Independent Viewers</strong></h2>
As a veteran writer of independent news and commentary, [social_link quote="I recommend that serious independents just turn off CNN, Fox News, and/or MSNBC et al." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295630522" handle="" hashes=""] and never look back. (And if you're still listening to talk radio-- <p><i>why</i>??)</p>

[caption id="attachment_23295630540" align="aligncenter" width="600"] These 6 Corporations Control 90% of The Media in America[/caption]<p><a href="http://ivn.us/2012/06/18/did-you-know-that-just-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="These 6 Corporations Control 90% of The Media in America" height="451" src="cloudinary://consolidation.jpg" width="600"></a></p>

<p>Aside from the readily-observable fact that partisan politics is the bread and butter of the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/mainstream-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mainstream media</a>, its viewers are also artificially confined to hearing about, thinking about, and debating just a few (usually never more than three at a time) carefully selected #issues, #stories, and #narratives each week.</p>

<p>Breaking out of that matrix can be tough, because even alternative news sources will often merely provide an alternative perspective on the very narrow set of stories that the corporate media giants hand-picked for you to talk about that week.</p>

<p>Independents don’t have to settle for websites and blogs that only serve up the same dish with a little seasoning. Here are just a very few recommendations of my personal favorites as possible starting points for a very fresh take:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Conferences</a>, <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_us" rel="noopener noreferrer">VICE</a>, <a href="http://bigthink.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Think</a>, <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">HowStuffWorks</a>, <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Dot</a>, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TorrentFreak</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/stefbot/videos" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefan Molyneux</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Godin</a>, <a href="http://singularityhub.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singularity Hub</a>, <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Ferriss</a>, <a href="http://documentarystorm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DocumentaryStorm</a>, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZeroHedge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia’s Main Page</a> (or a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/199285/learn-something-new-every-day-with-wikipedias-randompage" rel="noopener noreferrer">random one</a>), <a href="http://www.findingdulcinea.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finding Dulcinea</a>, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> (which is especially good if you use its subscriptions to customize the headlines based on your interests)… the truly adventurous could even <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">read a book</a>.</p>
