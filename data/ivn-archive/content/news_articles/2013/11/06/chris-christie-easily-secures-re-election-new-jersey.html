[outset][/outset]Nearly as soon as the polls closed, Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was projected as the winner. Due to his commanding lead in exit polls, Christie's victory isn't a surprise.<p><a href="http://endpartisanship.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Super No Funding Time_ad2" height="400" src="cloudinary://leave-it-to-canada-to-analyze-cause-of-partisanship-in-us-84225.jpg" width="600"></a></p>

<p>Christie's dominating victory in a blue state is expected to be a major case to national Republicans ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Christie has the support of Republicans, Democrats, and independents and is currently a GOP favorite for the presidential election.</p>

The special election had a record low voter turnout and cost the state $24 million, but had the potential to be a high profile race if it was held in November, which would have threatened Christie's incumbency.</p>
