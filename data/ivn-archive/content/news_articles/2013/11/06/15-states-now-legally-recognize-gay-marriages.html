<p>While much focus was put on the major gubernatorial and mayoral races across the nation on Tuesday, Illinois lawmakers approved the legalization of same-sex marriage. The law will go before Governor Pat Quinn who is expected to make Illinois the fifteenth state to allow gay couples to wed.</p>

<p>Currently, Illinois allows civil unions for same-sex couples, but for many the law didn't go far enough to ensure equal rights for all couples. The legalization of same-sex marriage in Illinois comes not even a month after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/21/sex-marriage-legalized-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer">withdrew his appeal</a> to delay marriage equality in his state.</p>
