[social_blockquote quote="30% of Americans get news on Facebook" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295629866" handle="@PewResearch" hashes=""] With over 1.1 billion users, Facebook has become a popular medium through which we share news.

<p>Pew Research Center and the Knight Foundation&nbsp;<a href="http://www.journalism.org/2013/10/24/the-role-of-news-on-facebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a>&nbsp;that about half of adult Facebook users, 47 percent, get news there. That is equal to 30 percent of the U.S. population.</p>

<p>With almost a third of the population seeing at least some news on Facebook, whether it's intentional or not, what do we really know about news on Facebook?</p>

[heading title="Here are the top 10 facts about news on Facebook" subtitle="From Pew's The Role of News on Facebook Report"]

<p><b>1. How We Engage:</b> 43 percent of Facebook news consumers post or share links to news stories on the network, with 32% of all Facebook news consumers discussing news with others Facebook.</p>

<p><b>2. More Time on Facebook Means More News:</b> 67 percent of Facebook users who spend about an hour a day get news there compared with only 41% of those who spend less than an hour a day on the site.</p>

<p><b>3. Your Political Affiliation Matters on Facebook: </b>Those with a political party affiliation are more likely to say they prefer news that shares their own point of view. From the report:</p>
<blockquote><b>"</b>Among U.S. adults overall, about a third of Republicans (33%) and Democrats (30%) like news this way, compared with 19% of independents. That pattern also is true among Facebook news consumers; among this group, 36% of Republicans, 34% of Democrats and just 24% of independents say they like news that mostly shares their own point of view."</blockquote>
<p><b>4. We're Not All News-Seekers:</b> In fact, the majority (78%) of people who consume news on Facebook get it while they are on the site for other reasons.</p>

<p><b>5. Millennials 'Like' Getting News on Facebook: </b>Young people (18- to 29– year-olds) account for about a third, 34 percent, of Facebook news consumers. This is in line with <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/06/03/10-statistics-you-didnt-know-about-social-media-and-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous Pew findings</a> that younger adults are much more likely to be politically active on social networking sites. <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/06/03/10-statistics-you-didnt-know-about-social-media-and-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer">

<p><strong>6. News Consumption is Not Limited to One Topic:</strong> About&nbsp;half, 49 percent, of Facebook news consumers report regularly getting news on six or more different topics, with the most popular topic entertainment, with community news a close second.</p>

<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile vs. Desktop:</strong>&nbsp;While mobile access to Facebook is growing,&nbsp;<span>Facebook news consumers' primary device for access is still a desktop/laptop: 53 percent desktop/laptop versus 46 percent mobile.</span></p>

<p><strong>8. Families and Friends Matter:&nbsp;</strong>Only 34 percent of Facebook news consumers have "liked" news organizations or journalists, thereby placing news in their news feed.</p>

<p>"<span>That means, then, that two-thirds of people who get news on Facebook have it passed along to them second, third or twentieth hand from their Facebook friends – rather than directly from news organizations," Pew reports.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>9. &nbsp;Getting To Know Your Friends:</strong>&nbsp;58 percent of Facebook news consumers&nbsp;have been surprised by a friend’s or family member’s political views posted on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>10. Why We Post:&nbsp;</strong>The most common reason why members of this group post news links is to pass along information they think is important for people to know.</p>
