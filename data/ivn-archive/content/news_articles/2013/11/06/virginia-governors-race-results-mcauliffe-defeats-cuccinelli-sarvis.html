<p>After months of personal attacks and divisive rhetoric, Democrat Terry McAuliffe will become Virginia's 72nd Governor. According to the Virginia State board of elections the former Democratic Party Chairman <a href="http://electionresults.virginia.gov/resultsSW.aspx?type=SWR&amp;map=CTY" rel="noopener noreferrer">defeated</a> Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Libertarian Robert Sarvis, 48 percent to 45.5 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>McAuliffe will replace the current Governor, Bob McDonnell, who soured with voters after apologizing for <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/mcdonnell-deeply-sorry-repays-loans-from-williams/article_0ab18eb4-f3bf-11e2-9520-0019bb30f31a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">improperly</a> receiving gifts in 2011 and 2012. The governor's race results follow strikingly negative campaigns from both front runners, each side resorting to personal attacks and negative advertising ahead of Tuesday's election.</p>

<p>Despite voter's consensus surrounding the alienating tactics used by Cuccinelli and McAuliffe, they advanced to the general election in June since <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/06/paltry-turnout-seen-virginia-primary-election" rel="noopener noreferrer">neither</a> faced a primary challenger. Only 3 percent of the state's 5.2 million registered voters cast a primary election ballot <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/06/11/in-off-year-va-primary-paltry-turnout-seen/" rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to CBS.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/11/05/virginia-race-for-governor/" rel="noopener noreferrer">result</a>, the Libertarian candidate, Robert Sarvis drew new-found support from Virginians seeking an alternative and secured nearly 8 percent of the vote. He was polling at about 10 <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2013/virginia/election_2013_virginia_governor" rel="noopener noreferrer">percent</a> going into election night in spite of not being allowed to participate in the various gubernatorial <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/libertarian-sarvis-injects-fresh-face-into-va-governors-race-forum/2013/10/26/15cddd32-3e67-11e3-b7ba-503fb5822c3e_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">debates.</a></p>
