<p>The practice of wiretapping has taken a new shape as technology has evolved. Telephone lines are no longer the only communication medium vulnerable to infiltration. E-mail, text messaging, and almost any form of online correspondence is susceptible to monitoring by a third party.</p>

<p>There have been a number of landmark court cases that have shifted the way government respects or rather, doesn't respect a citizen's privacy. Protected under the 4th amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to privacy is not as ironclad as some may think.</p>

<p>Evidence obtained without a warrant was first challenged in the Supreme Court case <em>Olmstead v. United States. </em>The Court ruled that the 4th amendment didn't apply to legally overheard telephone conversations. Future cases like <em>Katz v. United States</em> and <em>Smith v. Maryland</em> push the boundaries of privacy protections.</p>

<p>Luckily the 4th amendment has provided a significant stopping point for government overreach, but it continues to be tested even today, with legislation like the Patriot Act and the Protect America Act of 2007.</p>
