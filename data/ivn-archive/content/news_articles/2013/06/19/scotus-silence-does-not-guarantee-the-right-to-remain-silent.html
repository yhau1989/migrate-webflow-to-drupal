<p>Who knew the right to remain silent is contingent on expressly invoking that right?</p>

<p>The Fifth Amendment protects an individual's right against self-incrimination, allowing one to remain silent as a means to invoke that right. However, you cannot remain silent as a way to invoke the right to remain silent, you must expressly invoke the right to remain silent. Contrary to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/opinion-recap-if-you-want-to-claim-the-fifth/" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular belief</a>, the Supreme Court has held that view for decades since deciding&nbsp;<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/465/420/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Minnesota v.</em> </a><em><a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/465/420/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Murphy</a>&nbsp;</em>(1984).<span>
</span></p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>There is an express invocation requirement which means that a person must express the desire to invoke the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination in order to have that right. There are only two instances when the right against self-incrimination via the right to remain silent does not need to be expressed: (1) when you are on trial, allowing you to decline to take the stand; or (2) when you fail to assert the right due to governmental coercion.</p>

<p>The latter instance provided the basis for the&nbsp;<em>Miranda</em> <a href="http://www.mirandawarning.org/whatareyourmirandarights.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning</a>:&nbsp;"You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law." But, according to Monday's Supreme Court decision&nbsp;in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-246_7l48.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Salinas v. Texas</em></a>, anything you say&nbsp;<em>or don't say</em> can and will be used against you.</p>

This ruling hinged on the fact that the police were conducting informal questioning (Salinas was not in custody) and no official&nbsp;Miranda rights had been read. The individual was questioned for one hour, answering all of the police questions. When asked a possibly incriminating question regarding gun ballistics, the individual "[l]ooked down at the floor, shuffled hit feet, bit him bottom lip, cl[e]nched his hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up."

<p>Testimony regarding the individual's silence and fidgeting was permitted in court as evidence of his guilt.</p>

<p>This ruling prompts the question: what's next? Perhaps asserting the right against self-incrimination will also be permitted as evidence of guilt in court.</p>
