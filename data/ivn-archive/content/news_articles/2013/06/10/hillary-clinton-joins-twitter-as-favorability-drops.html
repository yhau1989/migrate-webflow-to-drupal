<p>It's official. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is now on Twitter, tweeting from the Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">@HillaryClinton</a>.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/344132945122054144</p>

<p>Her Twitter debut comes on the same day a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/162986/hillary-clinton-favorability-slips-slightly.aspx?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup Poll</a> marks her favorability at the lowest point its been since an&nbsp;unsuccessful&nbsp;presidential campaign in 2008. Based on a Gallup Poll conducted from June 1-4, 39% of Americans view Hillary Clinton unfavorably. In April, this number was 31 percent.</p>

<p>Her recent congressional&nbsp;testimony about the Benghazi controversy could be partially responsible for this drop in support, with independent voters most notable losing trust in the her leadership ability.</p>

<p>"Although Democratic and Republican attitudes toward Clinton have been static over these past contentious months, independents' views are now notably less favorable. A slim majority (52%) of independents hold a favorable opinion of Clinton, down from 63% in April."</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/162020/hillary-clinton-popular-obama-biden.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically</a>&nbsp;been a popular official in the Obama Administration - more popular than Obama and Biden - with high approval ratings among American citizens.</p>

<p>Could Twitter be an attempt to win back the trust of independent voters before a potential 2016 presidential campaign?&nbsp;If so, will it work?</p>
