<p><a href="http://cacs.org/ca/article/70" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Common Sense</a> (CACS) provided an infographic (below) that illustrates the differences between Senate Bill 69 and Governor Brown's education funding proposals. The two will be the competing plans to bring money to K-12 schools.</p>

<p>SB 69 relies on higher revenue projections that were provided by the Legislative Analyst Office (LAO). Gov. Brown's plan relies on the more modest estimates from the Department of Finance.</p>

<p>Base grants are the amount of money given to all districts. SB 69 supplemental grants are an additional 40 percent of the base grant, per-pupil, for the percentage of disadvantaged students in a school district. The governor would have supplemental grants at 35 percent, but have additional concentration grants for struggling districts.</p>

<p>Per-pupil funding would result in the following in SB 69:</p>
<blockquote>0 percent english learning/low-income (EL/LI) students = <strong>$7,378</strong>; 25 percent EL/LI = <strong>$8,116</strong>; 50 percent EL/LI = <strong>$8,854</strong>; 75 percent EL/LI = <strong>$9,591</strong>; 100 percent EL/LI = <strong>$10,329</strong></blockquote>
<p>Disadvantaged students are those who are free or reduced school lunch recipients, English learners, or a foster child.</p>

<p>The infographic assumes that the state crafts the 2013-2014 budget with the Department of Finance's lower projections. With that in mind, here is how both plans pan out in per-pupil funding:</p>
