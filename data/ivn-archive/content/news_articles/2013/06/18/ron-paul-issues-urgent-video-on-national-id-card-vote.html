<p>Ron Paul sent an urgent e-mail to his massive e-mail and fundraising base in opposition to a National ID Card vote on the current immigration reform bill. &nbsp;Ron Paul calls the National ID card amendment a ploy by the "Gang of Eight," which includes Chuck Schumer, Lindsay Graham, and John McCain, to try and sneak a massive National ID card amendment that will allow the government to monitor everything that you do.</p>

<p>"In the wake of recent events, the statist believe they have the perfect excuse to ratchet up their attacks on our remaining liberties," Paul warns.</p>

<p>Unlike the mainstream Republican opposition to immigration reform, Ron Paul's vehement opposition has nothing to do with&nbsp;amnesty or a pathways to citizenship. Paul warned that, with a National ID program, "it will only be a matter of time until they spend their work days making sure we don't eat, drink, or do anything that they don't want." And&nbsp;the most dangerous part of this amendment, he says, is the "biometric tracking technology which would allow federal bureaucrats to track our every move."</p>

<p>Here's the text of the e-mail:</p>
<blockquote>National ID is on the Senate floor.

And Harry Reid could force a vote at ANY hour - ANY day now.

<span>[Name], I can't stress enough how critical it is you watch the special video I made about how YOU can help defeat this dangerous scheme</span>.

With Harry Reid calling the shots in the U.S. Senate, there's literally not a moment to waste.
