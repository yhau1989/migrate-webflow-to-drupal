<p>Immigration has always played an important role in the development of California over the last two centuries. Today, immigrants represent a major portion of the California's electorate and more importantly have become the backbone of the economy.</p>

<p>According to the Immigration Policy Center's <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/new-americans-california" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 report,</a> &nbsp;foreign-born Californians now represent 27 percent of the state population and nearly half of them have been naturalized, meaning they can vote in the elections.</p>

<p>Immigrants represent a third of California's workforce and play a crucial role in industries such as agriculture, manufacturing or construction. Immigrants also represent an important share of the taxpayers as they contribute $30 billion in federal taxes,&nbsp;$5.2 billion in state income taxes, and&nbsp;$4.6 billion in sales taxes&nbsp;each year.Unauthorized immigrants in California also pay taxes to the amount&nbsp;$2.7 billion&nbsp;in state and local taxes in 2010.</p>

<p>Latino and Asians represent the majority of immigrants and children of immigrants. They now constitute 51.3 percent of California's population. These two groups not only have a great buying power in California,&nbsp;$310.5 billion for Latino's,&nbsp;$236.7 billion for Asians, but they also create many jobs. Businesses owned by Latinos and Asians comprise 1/4 of all businesses and employ more than 1.3 million people.</p>

<p>California immigrants constitute the backbone of the state's economy and are expected to play an important role in California economic recovery.</p>
