<p>According to research done by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stateintegrity.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="State Integrity">StateIntegrity.org</a>, states with unregulated campaign contributions have a higher risk of corruption in political financing. A&nbsp;state's overall risk is based on laws in place and the potential for corruption.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/campaign-contribution-limits-overview.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Four states">Four states</a> (Missouri, Oregon, Utah, and Virginia) do not have laws limiting campaign contributions, and consequently registered poor scores on the study's scale for potential corruption.</p>

<p>Because actualized corruption is not possible to accurately gauge, State Integrity created a scale which measures the potential for corruption in government. This is based on laws in place, their effectiveness, and the public's access to information and ability to be a check on government.</p>

<p>On a scale measuring corruption in all 50 states from least corruption potential to most, here is how the states that allow unlimited contributions rank:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.stateintegrity.org/oregon" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>: 14th, <a href="http://www.stateintegrity.org/missouri" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>: 16th, <a href="http://www.stateintegrity.org/utah" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Utah">Utah</a>: 36th, and <a href="http://www.stateintegrity.org/virginia" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>: 47th</p>

<p>While overall scores don't provide much correlation, the Political Financing category shows poor scores for these unlimited contribution states. Oregon earned a D-, Missouri an F, Utah an F, and Virginia an F as well.</p>

<p>It was not only their lack of campaign finance limitation that earned these poor scores.</p>

<p>The calculation of corruption risk for the Political Financing section&nbsp;takes into account any and all regulations in place for the financing of political parties and individual candidates, the effectiveness of those regulations, and citizen access to the regulations.</p>

<p>These states provide little oversight and transparency in these categories, which the study deemed important in its scale of overall state corruption.</p>

<p>While some may suggest the study incorporates a tough grading scale, this may not be the case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stateintegrity.org/california" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="California">California</a>, which ranked 4th on the corruption scale overall, earned itself a B- in political financing. It did so by earning stellar scores in citizen access and regulations in place, but still had F marks in terms of the effectiveness of those regulations.</p>

<p>Even if stifling the potential for corruption is difficult, a state can gain a B- on this scale for simply showing effort.</p>

<p>Regardless of personal belief on money in politics as it pertains to the ethos of democracy, there appears to be a direct connection between regulation on campaign contribution and the ensuing probability for corruption. This issue presents itself not only in state legislatures, but on the national scale as well.</p>

<p>Transparency Internationalâ€™s <a href="http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="survey">survey</a>&nbsp;of global corruption perception, and their subsequent <a href="http://www.transparency-usa.org/documents/CPI2012-TI-USAPressreleaseFINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="summation">summation</a>, notes that the 2012 spending in the United States elections, as well as the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, dropped America below comparable nations in the developed world.</p>

<p>The nation's 74 percent on the global scale ranked the US at 19th in corruption; a score lower than countries such as Australia, Germany, Singapore, Canada, Japan, and Denmark.</p>

<p>Even if these studies are merely measuring perception and potential, are Americans willing to accept scores of mediocrity in something as important as the nation's legislative firewalls to prevent corruption?</p>
