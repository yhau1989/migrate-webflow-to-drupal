<p>The latest voter registration figures in the City of San Diego explain the collapse of the Republican Party in the City. And the numbers don't look good for their prospects in 2014. For the first time, voters who decline to state a party preference now outnumber Republicans in San Diego.</p>

<p>Following a 2012 election that should have been a wake-up call to many for Republicans, 2014 will likely produce an even greater shock to the "establishment." By the numbers, only one City Council District is "Republican," and four are "safe" Democratic. Four lean Democratic with independents either equal to or a larger force than Republicans.</p>

<p><span>The picture is even bleaker for Republicans statewide. Even San Diego County has tipped to Democrats with independents now in a statistical tie with Republicans.</span></p>
