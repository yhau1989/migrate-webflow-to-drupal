<p><strong>The Favorable Winds of Pride</strong></p>

<p>I've spent most of the morning watching the House of Lords in Great Britain debate same-sex marriage. &nbsp;The legislation has already passed the House of Commons and is now awaiting approval from the upper chamber. &nbsp;Today was only the second reading and debate on a proposed amendment. &nbsp;And just last week, I watched as the Illinois House of Representatives decided not to vote on same-sex marriage, though the deadline for the bill was extended through the summer so it could be taken up if they were called back to deal with other pressing issues.</p>

<p>Both of these debates are on the heels of progress that has been made here in the US and in countries around the world. &nbsp;Just this year, in the United States, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Minnesota have approved same-sex marriage. &nbsp;Minnesota had just voted down a constitutional amendment in the November elections banning same-sex marriage. &nbsp;In all 12 states and DC allow same-sex marriages. &nbsp;As for internationally, Brazil, Uruguay, New Zealand, and France have approved same-sex marriage within the year. &nbsp;In all, thirteen countries have allow same-sex marriage with New Zealand and Uruguay to begin in August.</p>

<p><img alt="pride_postage" height="145" src="cloudinary://pride_postage-210x145.jpg" width="210">Despite opposition, the proverbial wind seems to be at the back of progressives and those in favor of equality. &nbsp;According to a recent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/abc-washington-post-gay-rights-poll-_n_3245068.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News/Washington Post</a> poll conducted between May 1 - 5, 55% of Americans support same-sex marriage. &nbsp;This goes with an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll done in April that showed that 63% of Americans are in favor of the federal government recognizing same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal. &nbsp;A <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/162398/sex-marriage-support-solidifies-above.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a> poll posted on May 13, showed that same-sex marriage had an approval rating of 53%. &nbsp;Conservative columnist George Will once stated on&nbsp;<em>This Week with George Stephanopoulos</em> that opposition to gay marriage is literally dying off, and he is essentially correct with that statement. &nbsp;Polls continually show that the greatest opposition for same-sex marriage comes from those that are older than 65. &nbsp;Only 44% support same-sex marriage among that demographic. &nbsp;Those that are 18-29 years old, support same-sex marriage 81%. &nbsp;And as the older generation continues to die off and with the influx of the younger generation, we are already seeing a dramatic shift in this discussion.</p>

<p>Even the political divide is changing. &nbsp;It was the Labour Party that brought about civil unions for same-sex couples in Great Britain, but yet it's the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, that is supporting same-sex marriage. &nbsp;In the US, the needle is gradually starting to move. &nbsp;First it was only the most liberal of politicians that supported civil unions and then same-sex marriage, but time would tick by and even the moderate liberals (Democrats) would come to show their support. &nbsp;Independents jumped on board. &nbsp;It was the conservative side (Republicans) that are the hold-out as they have been baiting the voters that are against equal rights. &nbsp;But even that needle position has started to shift in our favor. &nbsp;First it was just the moderate conservatives that either hold elected office in predominantly liberal states or those that are no longer in office. &nbsp;Then, just this year, two sitting Republican Senators (both moderates) came forward to support same-sex marriage. &nbsp;They are Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL). &nbsp;Regardless of how they came to our side, we should be grateful to have a voice in our support that was once against us. &nbsp;It gives us that small breach in the wall of opposition that we have needed. &nbsp;With their help, we can now focus on other moderates to get them to come over our to our side... especially if they are from states that have approved same-sex marriage already or at least lean more liberal.</p>

<p>We have begun what is essentially referred to as Pride Month here in the US. &nbsp;And this year, we have even more to be grateful for and to have pride in. &nbsp;Through living our lives, telling our stories, and continuing the drumbeat for equality, we are making progress toward equality. &nbsp;Even with set-backs, we are continuing to push the conversation forward. &nbsp;We will continue to face opposition, bullying, false attacks, and more. &nbsp;But we will rise above such people and such offenses . &nbsp;We will continue to educate by just being ourselves and eradicating the stereotypes that still prevail. &nbsp;So as we celebrate pride, let us be thankful for all that we have and the progress that has been made, all the work countless people have done, and take a momentary pause in our quest to regroup so we are ready to get back out there and continue on.</p>

<p>The wind has filled our sails and we are being guided by the sun rising higher and higher in the sky. &nbsp;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. wrote, "The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving." &nbsp;So today, we will celebrate, and tomorrow, we will continue to move forward.</p>
