<p>According to the latest survey by <a href="http://features.pewforum.org/same-sex-marriage-attitudes/slide4.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research</a>, independent voters who support expanding marriage rights to gay couples is steadily rising. Jumping from 52 percent in 2012 to 57 percent in 2013, independent support for gay marriage is on track to pass 60 percent by 2014.</p>

<p>As seen in the chart above, support among independent voters has risen 14 percentage points since 2001. While the numbers went through a roller coaster period from 2001-2009, they have steadily increased since then.</p>

<p>Overall, the Pew study shows 50 percent of Americans support the legalization of gay marriage, while 43 percent oppose it.</p>

<p>When evaluating ideological differences, trends indicate that support has nowhere to go, but up. Since 2001, the percentage of liberals and moderates who support marriage equality has risen 17 points, while support among conservatives has risen 12 percentage points.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/06/in-gay-marriage-debate-both-supporters-and-opponents-see-legal-recognition-as-inevitable/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveals</a> that no matter what people think of gay marriage, 72 percent of Americans -- nearly three-quarters -- believe legalization is inevitable.</p>

<p>As societal attitudes continue to change concerning homosexuality and gay marriage, the Pew study indicates that increased support is not restricted to party affiliation, political ideology, age, gender, or ethnicity.</p>
