<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>“Unlike traditional town halls and telephone town halls, this online conversation will allow Virginians to submit their comments and questions over several days, and it will allow constituents to view my responses when it is most convenient for them."</em> – <a href="http://www.warner.senate.gov/public/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Warner</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why he made the cut:&nbsp;</strong>Recognizing early in his career the benefits of reaching out to potential voters online, Sen. Mark Warner is no stranger to social media and its role in raising awareness.&nbsp;Warner’s constructive use of Facebook to further familiarize individuals with his political standings has rightfully earned him over 21,000 likes. By sharing articles about relevant legislation and posting informative statuses detailing his opinion on said legislation, he uses the social network as an avenue for communicating his positions with the constituents he represents.</p>

<p>Additionally, his devoted presence on Twitter allows him to express his beliefs in a more impersonal setting, allowing him to share with his 40,000 plus followers his day to day activities.&nbsp; On Twitter, he actively joins conversations in line with issues he supports and is deliberate in his use of hashtags, which allows him to broaden his audience online beyond those he represents. Warner uses Twitter to relate to his followers by tweeting pictures and retweeting those who address him in their tweets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Warner’s current efforts to use social media to gain support for immigration reform has seen results. Through Facebook and Twitter alone, Warner has stimulated meaningful discussion among voters about the pressing issue of immigration reform, creating a more politically informed voter base.</p>
