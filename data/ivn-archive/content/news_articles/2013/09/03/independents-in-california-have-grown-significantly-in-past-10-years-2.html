<p>The Public Policy Institute of California's latest compilation of voter facts reveals the <a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=526" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth</a> of non-affiliated voters in the state. Within the past ten years, registering as a non-affiliated voter increased by 5.6 percent:</p>
<blockquote>As of February 2013, the share of California voters who say they are registered as independent (also known as "decline to state” or "no party preference”) is 20.9 percent — up from 15.3 percent in 2003.</blockquote>
<p>Voter registration with the Democratic party slightly increased with an extra half-percent (43.9 percent to 44.4 percent), but Republican registration experienced a large dip. PPIC states there are 100,000 less Republican voters in California, a decrease of 6.3 percent (35.2 to 28.9).</p>

<p>The Republican Party is trying to regain its influence and become more significant in California politics under new leadership. New GOP Chairman Jim Brulte has already <a href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/general-news/20130328/california-gop-chair-jim-brulte-calls-for-republicans-to-leave-their-comfort-zones" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> for the party to "leave its comfort zones," but may face a steeper uphill battle with independent-minded voters.</p>

<p>Despite non-affiliated voter status, 41 percent of them say that they lean Democrat in elections while 29 percent lean Republican and 30 percent can go either way.</p>

<p>The two major parties may also have a difficulty convincing younger voters, who tend to remain politically independent:</p>
<blockquote>About half of independent likely voters (49%) are college graduates, compared to fewer Democrats (39%) and Republicans (34%). Independents have the highest share of likely voters age 18 to 34 (28%), compared to Democrats (22%) and Republicans (15%).</blockquote>
<p>Independent voters reached their highest point just before the June 2012 primary election when a <a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=784" rel="noopener noreferrer">record-high</a> registration hit 21.3 percent. <a href="http://ivn.us/california/2013/07/09/third-party-registration-in-california-on-the-rise/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third-parties</a> are also growing in the state, but PPIC revealed in 2012 that third parties may find it difficult to attract independent voters:</p>
<blockquote>Seven in 10 independent likely voters (71%) say they would prefer to remain unaffiliated even if there was a political party that was a good reflection of their political views.</blockquote>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that non-affiliated, independent voters are not politically homogeneous. An increase of independents in California means an increase diversity of opinion and less predictable voter behavior.</p>
