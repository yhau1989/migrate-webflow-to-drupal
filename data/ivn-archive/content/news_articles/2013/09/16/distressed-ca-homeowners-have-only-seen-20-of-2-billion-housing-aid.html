<p>With existing-home sales and prices surging, once-dour housing analysts now glow about the return of a linchpin for the economy and one of the most-watched barometers for the recovery.</p>

<p><a href="http://m.npr.org/news/Business/214306863?textSize=small" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Public Radio</a> aired a newscast that positively beamed about the rebound in early August, trumpeting stats that home construction jumped more than 20 percent from a year ago.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2013/08/existing-home-sales-spike-in-july" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors,</a> existing-home sales — completed transactions for single-family homes, condos, and townhouses — shot up by 6.5 percent to crest at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million in July.</p>

<p>Add to that the good news for other gauges — with <a href="https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/35529_cshomeprice-release-0827.pdf?force_download=true" rel="noopener noreferrer">S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indices</a> showing that home prices rose 12.1 percent year-over-year in June — and it would seem that the all-important housing market has finally turned a corner 4 years after it went belly up.</p>

<p>What role did federal aid injections play in housing’s slow return? Recent reports suggest it varies at best.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama helped pass legislation in 2010 that extended his Republican predecessor’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to include an 18-state, $7.6-billion <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/Monthly%20Report%20to%20Congress%20August%202013.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardest-Hit Fund</a>. The program was designed to keep struggling homeowners in their homes and prevent new foreclosure gluts unhelpful to home construction.</p>

<p>However, federal housing aid remains trapped behind red tape and still-high eligibility requirements, according to analysis by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/15/federal-mortgage-help/1990473/" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, which found that only 16 percent of the funds have reached homeowners in need of mortgage unemployment assistance and payment reductions.</p>

<p>California — one of the nation’s hardest-hit states, with one in every 901 homeowners facing foreclosure, according to <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/statsandtrends/foreclosuretrends/ca" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealtyTrac</a>&nbsp;— has been granted the most of any state with nearly $2 billion in aid disbursements. Of that, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/Monthly%20Report%20to%20Congress%20August%202013.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">36.6 percent</a> has been funneled through the system and reached state and nonprofit coffers.</p>

<p>But, how much of that have California homeowners actually seen? Not much.</p>

<p>The CalHFA Mortgage Assistance Corporation (CalHFA MAC), the nonprofit tasked with reviewing applicants for eligibility and working with mortgage servicers to make homes more affordable, <a href="http://keepyourhomecalifornia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HFA_CA_Q2_2013.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that it has doled out close to $382 million in assistance to 26,242 homeowners since it secured its tax-exemption status.</p>

<p>This means distressed homeowners in California have only seen 20 percent of their $2 billion in federal aid from the Hardest-Hit Fund.</p>

<p>It’s not a far cry from other states. By comparison, the <a href="http://www.rgj.com/article/20130303/BIZ02/303030052/Help-homeowners-slow-reach-masses-Nevada" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reno-Gazette Journal</a> recently discovered that homeowners in neighboring Nevada, which weathered the worst of the housing crisis, have netted only 11 percent of its own, much smaller $194 million allocation so far.</p>

<p>“This is government bureaucracy at its finest,” the Journal quoted Victor Joecks, communication director for the <a href="http://npri.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nevada Policy Research Institute</a>, a conservative think tank.</p>

<p>Joecks&nbsp;called the programs “a perfect example of why government shouldn’t pick winners and losers in the economy.”</p>

<p>To be fair, a lot depends on variables typically out of control for the nonprofit execs and staffers charged with processing homeowner applications.</p>

<p>Large mortgage servicers like Bank of America and Chase, responsible for bad loans and properties, must agree to the form of assistance before anything is spent.</p>

<p>Case in point, CalHFA provides a disclaimer with its servicer list that says Bank of America will only participate in loan recasts for principal reductions — a controversial program that critics say helps needy homeowners, but also weaken the bottom lines of banks and government-backed enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>

<p>The Journal quoted executive directors for Nevada’s hardest-hit fund nonprofit as pointing to frequently problematic barriers, including lack of awareness and high borrower eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>However, slow-moving aid recalls efforts by lawmakers and analysts to resist stimulus legislation like the Hardest-Hit Fund in the first place.</p>

<p>Even if the funds remain out of reach for distressed homeowners, it seems to be costing Americans less on the whole. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44256_TARP.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated</a> that TARP's transactions would fall $3 billion less than its $24 billion forecast earlier in 2013.</p>

<p>Only time will tell if it helps the housing recovery.</p>
