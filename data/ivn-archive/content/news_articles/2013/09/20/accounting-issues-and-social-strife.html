<p>In 2011, Wisconsin state budget and accounting issues actually got so exciting they brought reminders of protests from the 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp; The 2011 debate centered on how the state would approach paying retirement benefits for government workers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wisconsin’s ‘Budget Repair Bill’ included provisions to limit pay and benefits and to restrict collective bargaining. These provisions sparked widespread protest, including counter-protests in favor of the bill.&nbsp; After the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the bill, the protests faded away, but the social forces remain strong underneath.</p>

<p>Looking at finances across the 50 states, Truth in Accounting (TIA) estimates that Wisconsin is actually in relatively good shape.&nbsp; TIA’s latest estimate for Wisconsin’s “<a href="http://www.statedatalab.org/glossary/detail/each-taxpayers-financial-burden-surplus" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taxpayer Burden</a>” runs at $4,800, compared to a 50 state average of $9,100.</p>

<p>Just south of Wisconsin’s border, there is a lot of financial trouble but little apparent social turmoil.&nbsp; TIA’s latest estimate for Illinois’ Taxpayer Burden’ runs at $42,200.&nbsp; In other words, every taxpayer in Illinois (roughly equal to the number of households in the state) would have to write a check for $42,200 to pay off the bills that exceed the assets the state has available to pay those bills.&nbsp; This is the second highest TIA Taxpayer Burden estimate of all the states in the entire nation.</p>

<p>Why are we seeing active social strife popping up in Wisconsin, but not in Illinois?</p>

<p>Truth in Accounting believes that untruthful accounting is an important part of the answer.&nbsp; State governments have long been allowed to accumulate massive debts off of their balance sheets, all the while touting ‘balanced budgets’, achieved in important part by shady government accounting.</p>

<p>Wisconsin reports its results under government accounting standards like those for Illinois.&nbsp; However, Wisconsin has significantly stricter controls on funding future obligations that lie outside the state’s official balance sheet.&nbsp; Because of these controls, Wisconsin has some of the best-funded government retirement benefits in the nation.&nbsp; Illinois, by contrast, has some of the worst funded programs – and they aren’t on the balance sheet.</p>

<p>Push came to shove earlier in Wisconsin. In Illinois, we may just be looking at the calm before the storm.</p>
