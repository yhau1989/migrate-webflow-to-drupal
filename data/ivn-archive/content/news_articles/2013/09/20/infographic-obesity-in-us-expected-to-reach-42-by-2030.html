<p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, 1.4 billion people are overweight -- half a billion are obese -- and America&nbsp;is&nbsp;at the top of the list of the most obese developed nation in the world -- 31.8 percent&nbsp;of its population and rising.&nbsp;That means almost 1 in every 3 people in the United States is classified as obese.</p>

<p><em><strong>That number is expected to grow to 42 percent&nbsp;by 2030.</strong></em></p>

<p>What's driving our expanding waistlines, which eats away at $147 billion annually in medical costs? For starters, only 24 percent of American adults eat the recommended 5 servings of produce daily.</p>

<p>The issue, Michelle Obama argues, starts at a young age, with her most recent push focusing on food marketing and its impact on shaping the eating behaviors of children.</p>

<p>“Whatever we all might believe about personal responsibility and self-determination, I think we can all agree that it doesn’t apply to children,” Michelle Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/09/18/michelle-obamas-plays-referee-in-the-food-tug-of-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;food company executives in a meeting on the topic earlier this week.</p>

<p>While obesity rates among low-income preschoolers has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/06/childhood-obesity-preschoolers/2623909/" rel="noopener noreferrer">decreased in 19 states</a> since the first lady's push for healthy living between 2008 and 2011, it is still a widespread problem in not only America, but worldwide.</p>
