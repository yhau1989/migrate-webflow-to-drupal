<p>Supporters of Proposition 14 and the Top-Two Open Primary system in California have scored another legal victory after the California Superior Court in Alameda ruled in favor of motions to dismiss all claims made by the plaintiffs in the case against Proposition 14.</p>

<p>In November 2011, third parties in California challenged the new primary system, claiming it violates the right of association for third party candidates and political parties, as well as the rights of voters to vote freely in elections. The plaintiffs are left with the option to appeal the ruling, but for now, "top-two" has withstood all legal challenges against it.</p>
