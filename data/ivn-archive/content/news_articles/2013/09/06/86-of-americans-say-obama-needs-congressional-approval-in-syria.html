<p>While President Obama could have to wait <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/06/obama-wait-congress-vote-syria" rel="noopener noreferrer">two weeks</a> for Congress to vote on U.S. involvement in Syria, Obama has already made it clear that with or without Congressional approval, he has the authority to attack Syria.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/09/03/poll-can-president-elevate-syrian-conflict-without-approval" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a> our readers, "Should <em><strong>any</strong></em> president be allowed to authorize an act of war without approval?"</p>

<p>Of the 438 respondents, <em><strong>86% of our readers answered NO</strong></em>, the president should not be allowed to authorize an act of war without approval.</p>
