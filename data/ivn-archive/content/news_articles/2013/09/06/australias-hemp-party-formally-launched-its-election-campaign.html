<p>“America has given us huge encouragement,” proclaimed Michael Balderstone, HEMP’s President. “Half of America now has access to medical cannabis and now they’ve started to get new regulations for recreational cannabis. So, you now, the wall is down there and no big deal, the place hasn’t gone crazy.”</p>

<p>In Australia, the production of industrial hemp is legal, but its psychoactive cousin that we all adore remains illegal. <a href="http://the420times.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Help End Marijuana Prohibition wants marijuana legalized</strong></a> for all adults, which is a strategy that they feel will help bring an end to the criminal activity that is directly associated with the black market.</p>
