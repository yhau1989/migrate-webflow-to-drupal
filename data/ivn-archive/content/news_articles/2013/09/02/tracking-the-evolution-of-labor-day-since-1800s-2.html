<p>In 1970, postal workers staged a massive strike wherein 210,000 workers brought New York, Detroit, and Philadelphia to a stand-still. Then-president Nixon was forced to declare a state of emergency. The balance between 'management' and workers remains a fundamental dynamic in political life today.</p>
