<p>I became an advocate for online voting&nbsp;in the United States because I strongly believe we need greater voter participation.&nbsp; Higher voter turnout from all demographic groups, particularly younger working voters, is an important goal.&nbsp; Common sense tells me that making voting less inconvenient can help us achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Higher turnout is certainly still the dream of online voting advocates.&nbsp; After several years of listening to opponents,&nbsp; however, &nbsp;I must admit that&nbsp;I am equally moved by frustration over how our current voting systems are characterized by most "election integrity" advocates.&nbsp; There is a distinct "if it aint broke don't fix it" attitude regarding election modernization. &nbsp;The problem, of course, is that the status quo is extremely broken.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of "<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/03/nyc-board-of-elections-workers-unearth-hundreds-of-uncounted-2012-ballots-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">mushroom ballots</a>?"&nbsp; Election insiders use this term to refer to paper ballots that "emerge from the shadows" weeks, months, or even years after an election.&nbsp; They either accidentally or criminally end up in someone's garage, the trunk of a car, or shoved in the wrong folder and stored away uncounted.&nbsp; In case you think these are just stories from the past, think again. &nbsp;Several months ago hundreds of&nbsp;ballots <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/07/more-ballots-found-in-espaillatrangel-primary" rel="noopener noreferrer">popped</a> up in different elections in New York City. Make no mistake, this kind of thing still happens all the time.</p>

<p>We all remember the U.S. Presidential election of 2000 and Bush V. Gore. &nbsp;We saw the impact that a small number of poorly designed ballots had on a major election. Proponents of voting on paper seem to have forgotten.&nbsp; They insist we can't trust our elections to digital technology, despite using it for everything else in our lives, because of the "scale" of&nbsp;impact if something goes wrong. What larger scale does one need than Bush V. Gore?</p>

<p>Ballot confusion will always happen with paper voting. Too many things get crammed onto one page, or multiple pages are used.&nbsp; Some counties in Florida were using ballots up to 12 pages <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/florida-secretary-of-state-recommends-changes-to-u/nWFyL/" rel="noopener noreferrer">long</a> in last year's election,&nbsp;bringing about the eight hour long&nbsp;lines to vote&nbsp;on election day.</p>

<p>Next time&nbsp;opponents of online voting"are "warning" you about&nbsp;security issues that are quite theoretical, ask yourself what is secure about paper voting. &nbsp;The mushroom ballots alone&nbsp;answer that question,&nbsp;and there is nothing theoretical about them.</p>

<p>Online voting, on the other hand, gives you much more than added convenience.&nbsp; It brings the very security and auditability that the election integrity people claim is so vital.&nbsp; All important data is kept forever, in redundant fashion on multiple servers.&nbsp; No votes ever emerge from the shadows or disappear into them with digital voting.</p>

<p>Ever hear of an "over-vote"?&nbsp; Your ballot is thrown away when the people hand counting the votes (usually partisan election supervisors) decide&nbsp;that a stray pencil mark on your ballot invalidates it. &nbsp;Your vote is then literally thrown in the garbage.&nbsp; How many times&nbsp;have you taken the trouble to vote, only to have it not count? &nbsp;You'll never know&nbsp;because it isn't like they tell you.&nbsp; As for online voting, there are no over-votes, ever.</p>

<p>Recently, when I claimed in a discussion about&nbsp;voting that most critics&nbsp;are unwilling to examine the severe flaws of the status&nbsp;quo,&nbsp;a prominent advocate for paper voting disagreed.&nbsp; He said the election integrity community is very interested in how to make a more secure paper ballot, a better marker, or a more efficient way to hand recount the ballots.&nbsp; Should this be what the future of voting brings us, a better paper ballot or a better marker?</p>

<p>So how do you think we should&nbsp;be&nbsp;voting in the United States in the decades to come - mushrooms or cloud?</p>
