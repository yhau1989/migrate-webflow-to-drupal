[social_blockquote quote="We have to find a new balance." hyperlink="http://a.ivn.us/16joKTB" handle="@Pontifex" hashes=""] The libertarian approach to social issues seems to be gaining steam, even with vestiges of traditional order like Catholic Church. In a broad sense, the appreciation and adherence to traditional values, but not violating others' liberty is what aligns Pope Francis here.

<p>In an exclusive <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with America Magazine, published Thursday, Pope Francis revealed a libertarian undercurrent to his philosophy on social issues like abortion and gay marriage, yet reaffirmed the church's position remains consistent.</p>
<blockquote>“We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. This is not possible. I have not spoken much about these things, and I was reprimanded for that. But when we speak about these issues, we have to talk about them in a context. The teaching of the church, for that matter, is clear and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time."</blockquote>
<p>Pope Francis' stance sounds somewhat similar to Ron Paul's <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/octoberweb-only/ron-paul-church-abortion-narcotics-marriage.html?start=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a> made during the presidential campaign, "Biblically and historically, the government was very uninvolved in marriage. I like that. I don't know why we should register our marriage to the federal government. I think it's a sacrament. I think it should be biblical, and politically I don't like to fight with people who disagree with me, as long as they don't force their views on me."</p>

<p>The two most divisive culture war topics in American politics have been a hotbed for political mudslinging for decades. The Pope appears to recognize the tension, and said focusing on such topics are a recipe for disaster.</p>
<blockquote>"The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church’s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently.... We have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel."</blockquote>
<p>Such a strategy has swept the American political scene as well. More politicians have opened up to the prospect of legalizing same-sex marriage over the last few years. Republicans like <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/03/justin_amash_draws_ire_of_same.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Amash</a> (R-Michigan) and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/susan-collins_n_3005415.html?utm_hp_ref=politics" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Collins</a> (R-Maine) contend that it isn't the federal government's place to interfere.</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers are toeing a similar line to Pope Francis when it comes to social issues. Each face a base of supporters historically hostile to socially liberal ideologies. Yet, traditional attitudes on social issues are eroding as consensus continues to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/gay-marriage-support-hits-new-high-in-post-abc-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow</a> in the direction of greater personal freedom.</p>

<p>So is Pope Francis the Ron Paul of popes? Not exactly but he's probably about as libertarian as the papacy can get.</p>
