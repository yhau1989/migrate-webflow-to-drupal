<p>When asked about the balance between our right to privacy versus government interest in relation to the NSA scandal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said the government "blew it" at the TechCrunch Disrupt Conference in San Francisco.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We take our role really seriously. I think it's my job, it’s our job, to protect everyone who uses Facebook and the information they share with us. It’s our government’s job to protect all of us, our freedom and the economy. They did a bad job at balancing those things here...</em>

<em>Frankly, I think that the government blew it. They blew it on communicating the balance of what they were going for."</em></blockquote>

<p>The number, reports Zuckerberg, is around 9,000 requests.&nbsp;<em><strong>Watch his statement below:</strong></em></p>
