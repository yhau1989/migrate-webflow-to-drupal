<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/district-of-columbia.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="district-of-columbia" height="200" src="cloudinary://district-of-columbia.png" width="200"></a>The District of Columbia Council is in the process of considering the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana, but a pro-marijuana organization titled DCMJ, which is a group of residents working to change the outdated marijuana laws in the District of Columbia,&nbsp;proclaims the decriminalization bill doesn’t go far enough.</p>

<p>DCMJ has proposed making possession of less than two ounces of dried flowers and/or cultivating up to three marijuana plants civil offenses rather than criminal. Said offenses would be punishable by fines up to $100 which would be assessed by alcohol regulation authorities.</p>

<p>Attorney General Irv Nathan discovered a provision that would require offenders under the age of 18 to attend a drug awareness program which violates a city restriction preventing ballot items from appropriating taxpayer funds.</p>

<p>Furthermore, adding marijuana offenders to the groups protected by D.C.’s Human Rights Act could be a financial liability for the city meaning that possession would remain illegal under federal law and he is unacquainted with a decree that would give the council consent to prevent police from arresting individuals in violation of federal law.</p>

<p>According to Adam Eidinger of DCMJ 2014, after receiving that particular news the group pulled their current proposal and will submit a revised copy as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The bill to&nbsp;decriminalize marijuana&nbsp;in the District of Columbia is expected to pass the council later this year and could become law by early 2014.</p>
