<p>Thousands of bikers roared into Washington D.C. Wednesday, to protest a rally organized by the American Muslim Political Action committee (AM PAC).&nbsp;The response was brought on by AM PAC’s choice to hold their ‘Million American March Against Fear’ on September 11, 2013.</p>

<p>The march was organized to draw attention to multiple issues facing Muslims living in America and abroad. These include the lack of transparency and unanswered questions surrounding the 9/11 attacks, social injustice facing Muslim Americans, and the use of armed drones abroad.</p>

<p>The National Parks Service granted a permit for AM PAC’s march around the National Mall and Capitol. However, it did not grant the bikers permit request for a police escort. Belinda Bee, coordinator of the ‘2 Million Bikers to DC’ ride, questioned the political motives behind the National Park Service’s decision.</p>
