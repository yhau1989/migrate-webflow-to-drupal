<p>As the United States government is just hours away from its first shutdown in 17 years, Senate Democrats and House Republicans continue to go back and forth on who is to blame instead of sitting down and having a real discussion on practical solutions. If a budget deal is not met by 12:01 Tuesday morning, departments classified as "non-essential" will close until Congress agrees on a budget for the 2014 fiscal year.</p>

[comment_cta title="Do you think members of Congress should not receive pay if they allow the government to go into a partial shutdown?"]

<p>If non-essential departments close, many federal employees may see a delay in pay depending on how long it takes for lawmakers to agree on a budget deal. This includes soldiers.</p>

<p>Some have expressed the belief that members of Congress should see a freeze in pay, an idea that has been presented to legislators in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. While many have dodged the question or would not agree to no pay, U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said if federal workers don't get paid, neither will he.</p>
