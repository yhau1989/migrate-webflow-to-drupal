<p>Ever since he began running for office, Rand Paul has been publicly contrasted with his former congressman father. Below are 8 ways Rand Paul is different from Ron Paul:</p>
<h3>1. Rand Paul is More Compromising and Pragmatic</h3>
<p>Ron Paul often won <a href="http://www.bigeye.com/bulkflyers.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">acclaim</a> for never voting for a tax increase or for any bill not specifically authorized by the Constitution. Rand Paul has indicated an interest in compromising on matters from <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/can-rand-paul-lead-gop-to-compromise-on-immigration-and-marijuana" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigration</a> reform to <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/09/rand-paul-ive-said-all-along-its-not.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+economicpolicyjournal%2FYZSb+(EconomicPolicyJournal.com)" rel="noopener noreferrer">health care</a>. He has also made efforts to compromise within his own party by <a href="http://mjayrosenberg.com/2013/03/19/did-your-favorite-progressive-senator-sign-aipac-letter-to-obama-telling-him-to-stand-up-for-occupation-here-is-the-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer">working</a> with <a href="http://www.aipac.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIPAC</a> and allowing some <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/giraldi/2013/06/19/rand-paul-defender-of-the-faith/" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign aid</a> to countries considered pro-American.</p>
<blockquote>For our country’s sake, certainly for our soldiers’ sake, America’s mission should always be to keep the peace not police the world <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VFW&amp;src=hash" rel="noopener noreferrer">#VFW</a>

— Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenRandPaul/statuses/359301999742812161" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2013</a></blockquote>
<h3>2. Statewide Elections - Rand Paul Has More Appeal Across an Entire State</h3>
<p>In his first race, Rand Paul won the primary and general elections by <a href="http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=21&amp;year=2010&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">23</a> and <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/kentucky" rel="noopener noreferrer">12</a> points, respectively, and has already won more statewide elections than his father. The only time Ron Paul ever won a popular vote was the US Virgin Islands <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/12/ron-paul-virgin-islands-caucus-results_n_1339944.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">caucus</a> in 2012.</p>
<h3>3. Party Politics</h3>
<p>Rand Paul&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/06/rand-paul-endorses-romney-125624.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a>&nbsp;Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 in a sign of party loyalty and&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2012/06/09/rand-pauls-endorsement-of-mitt-romney-highlights-principles-and-pragmatism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pragmatism</a>. Ron Paul has not publicly endorsed a major party candidate candidate since Ronald Reagan. In 2008, the elder Paul, a GOP officeholder,&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/24/dismissing-bob-barr-ron-paul-endorses-constitution-party-candidate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a>&nbsp;Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin for president.</p>
<h3>4. Sanctions</h3>
<blockquote>The real isolationists are those who choose to use force overseas to promote democracy, rather than seek change through diplomacy, engagement, and by setting a positive example. - Ron Paul</blockquote>
[advertisement]Ron Paul has <p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/ron-paul-sanctions-against-iran-are-an-act-of-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> sanctions "an act of war" <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-rlc/2412613/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">and</a> a "precursor to war." While Rand Paul has voted for sanctions on Iran, he has fought to ensure that nothing in the language of the <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/03/rand-paul-blocks-iran-sanctions-bill-118887.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctions</a> "shall be construed as a declaration of war or an authorization of use of force."</p>
<h3>5. Iran</h3>
 it was "reckless" to take "nuclear weapons off the table in certain circumstances" regarding Iran. [pullout_blockquote quote="I think it equally unwise to say we will never contain a nuclear Iran." author="Rand Paul"]He has also couched his subsequent support for sanctions by <p>During his campaign for Senate, Rand Paul <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2010/05/23/rand-pauls-problem-and-ours/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-shams/is-rand-paul-going-neocon_b_3784998.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a> "a nuclear Iran would be a threat on a global scale."</p>

<p>Ron Paul has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/ron-paul-iran-does-not-threaten-our-national-security/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> there was no evidence Iran was building a weapon with its nuclear program. The elder Paul also rhetorically asked, "Why wouldn't Iran want a nuclear weapon" when so many of its neighbors have them. It was an indication that, although Ron Paul opposes nuclear weapons, he does not consider a nuclear Iran a threat to the US.</p>
<h3>6. Rand Paul is More Likely to Talk About Religion</h3>
[embed width="320" height="275"]http://youtu.be/CW4otVz8DdU[/embed]While Ron Paul has always identified himself as a Christian, he has doesn't talk about his faith very often. He has also <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW4otVz8DdU" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> activities like the Prayer Breakfast seem more about publicity than faith.</p>

<p>Rand Paul has spoken to numerous faith-based groups, often as a way of <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/rand-paul-christianity-and-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer">spreading</a> his views about Just War. The younger Paul also expressed his antipathy to a strike on Syria by making a deliberate <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/rand-paul-no-war-on-middle-eastern-christianity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">point</a> about how it would affect&nbsp;Middle-Eastern Christians.</p>
<h3>7. War on Drugs</h3>
<p>Ron Paul has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/ron-paul-war-on-drugs-prohibition_n_1183353.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> the war on drugs has been a "failure" comparable to the prohibition of alcohol. He has also <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/DougWead/legalize-drugs-ron-paul/2011/07/29/id/405266" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> a general de-criminalization of narcotics on a federal level.</p>

<p>During his 2010 campaign, Rand Paul <a href="http://blog.mpp.org/medical-marijuana/paul-campaign-clarifies-medical-marijuana-stance/08202010/" rel="noopener noreferrer">favored</a> states rights regarding drug prohibition while also <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/rand-paul-learns-to-love-the-drug-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer">telling</a> an evangelical Christian group in Iowa earlier this year that he "does not support the legalization of drugs like marijuana."</p>

<p>More recently, the younger Paul came out <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2013/09/18/rand-paul-i-am-here-to-ask-that-we-begin-the-end-of-mandatory-minimum-sentencing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">against</a> mandatory minimum sentencing for drug possession. He also called for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/16/rand-paul-wants-to-restore-felons-voting-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer">restoration</a> of voting rights for felons, an important issue in the drug war.</p>
<h3>8. Income Tax</h3>
<p>Since at least his 2008 run for president, Ron Paul famously <a href="http://www.ronpaul.com/on-the-issues/taxes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the national income tax should be "repealed and replaced with nothing." Rand Paul as recently as this summer advocated for the "Fair Tax" with a <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/US/rand-paul-flat-tax/2013/06/25/id/511886" rel="noopener noreferrer">rate</a> of 17 percent for individuals and supports eliminating "most" of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
