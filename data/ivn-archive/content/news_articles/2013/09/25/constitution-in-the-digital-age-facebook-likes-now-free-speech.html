<p>Whether you "like" it or not, Facebook "likes" are considered to be a vital component of free speech<span>&nbsp;protected under the First Amendment, a U.S. appeals court&nbsp;<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/court-clicking-facebook-free-speech" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds</a>.</span></p>

<p>The decision reverses a lower court ruling that Facebook likes are not "actual statements," ruling in favor of a&nbsp;former Virginia deputy sheriff who claimed he had lost his job over "liking" his boss' opponent on Facebook during the 2009 city sheriff race.</p>

<p>But, is clicking a button really an expression of a person's opinion? When that button indicates your support for a political candidate or idea, yes,&nbsp;U.S. Circuit Judge William Traxler confirms, equatingthe online practice of "liking" a political candidate's page to the offline activity of displaying a yard sign.</p>
<blockquote><em>“Liking a political candidate’s campaign page communicates the user’s approval of the candidate and supports the campaign by associating the user with it…It is the Internet equivalent of displaying a political sign in one’s front yard, which the Supreme Court has held is substantive speech," Traxler <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/169110696/Facebook-4-Th-Circuit" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>As established in the 1994 Supreme Court case&nbsp;<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=u10373" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>City of Ladue v. Gilleo,</em></a>&nbsp;"displaying a sign from one’s own residence often carries a message quite distinct from placing the sign someplace else, or conveying the same text or picture by other means."</p>

<p>Just as yard signs represent a "cheap and convenient form of communication," Facebook likes act as a badge of approval, the collection of which creates a unique profile to which a Facebook user chooses to identify with. It is a form of self-expression, one which should be equally protected on and offline.</p>

<p>We live in a digital age. In 2012, Americans spent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100275798" rel="noopener noreferrer">121 billion minutes</a> on social media sites in just one month -- that's 6.5 hours per person. And while some online users are <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/pew-facebook-study/" rel="noopener noreferrer">shying away from Facebook</a>, it still tops the list of social media sites, with 1.15 billion users.</p>

<p>Why then have lawmakers been so slow in responding to the demands of social media users in areas such as free speech and privacy?&nbsp;Racked with uncertainty, lawmakers simply aren't experts on the evolving world of the Internet:</p>
<blockquote><em>"<a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2013/08/07/can-legislation-ever-keep-up-with-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainty</a> on how to best apply our rights to the Internet and enforce that they are protected has led to inaction, allowing for the rise of unconstitutional datamining, with&nbsp;Facebook now owning (<a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2012/12/31/facebook-and-datalogix-now-they-know-everything-about-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">and selling</a>) the most extensive set of online data of consumers worldwide."</em></blockquote>
<p>While the legal system still has some catching up to do when it comes to adapting to our increasingly tech-oriented society, this decision expands the scope of the First Amendment, inching one step closer to the incorporation of all the nuances of digital communication into our constitutional interpretation.</p>
