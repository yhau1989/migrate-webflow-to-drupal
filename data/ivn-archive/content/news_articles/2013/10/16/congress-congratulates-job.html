<p>Good job Congress. After two weeks of anxiety about the future of our economy, two weeks without national parks, two weeks of furloughed federal employees, two weeks of confusion over social security checks, Veteran services, essential vs. non-essential federal employees, and two weeks of deteriorating Congressional approval ratings, a deal has been reached.</p>
<blockquote>“This compromise we reached will provide our economy with the stability it desperately needs. It’s never easy for two sides to reach consensus. It’s really hard, sometimes harder than others. This time was really hard...The country came to the brink of a disaster. But in the end, political adversaries set aside their differences and disagreement to prevent that disaster," <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/government-shutdown-debt-ceiling-default-update-98390.html#ixzz2huKQt8pL" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;Majority&nbsp;Leader Harry Reid.</blockquote>

<p>The proposed deal would&nbsp;fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt ceiling until Feb. 7.&nbsp;And the&nbsp;first to congratulate these public servants is Congress itself:</p>
