<p>Representative Gage Froerer is currently trying to convince the Utah Substance Abuse Advisory Council to treat <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56968773-78/epilepsy-utah-isaac-sintz.html.csp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannabidiol extracts</a> as something other than a controlled substance in order for the beneficial cannabinoid to be imported into the state without those involved fearing incarceration.</p>

<p>Congressman Froerer, the same lawmaker who pushed a ban on dangerous synthetic compounds, claims that transporting the extract to Utah may not require legislation. But if legislation is indeed needed, Froerer has vowed to champion the bill.</p>

<p>He has even gone as far as to rename the Cannabidiol extracts “Alepsia,” which means belonging to seizure.</p>
<blockquote>“They could go over to Colorado right now and bring it in,” Representative Froerer said. “But they don’t want to do anything that might be perceived as breaking the law.”</blockquote>
<p>According to the Epilepsy Association of Utah, no state has legislation that specifically mentions the use of high-CBD varieties of marijuana in the form of oral concentrates.</p>

<p>“Utah has an opportunity to be innovative,” said the epilepsy association’s president, Annette Maughan, whose 6-year-old son also has epilepsy. “We are desperate in our need for this legislation to happen in this session. Our children are seizing every day.”</p>
