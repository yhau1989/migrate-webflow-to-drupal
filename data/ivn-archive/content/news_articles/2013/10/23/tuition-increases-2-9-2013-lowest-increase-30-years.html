<p>Concerns about rising tuition and how students can afford to finance their major investments in post-secondary education are widespread. Solid insights into these questions require accurate and up-to-date information about prices.</p>

&nbsp;reports on the prices charged by colleges and universities in 2013-14, how prices have changed over time, and how they vary within and across types of institutions, states, and regions. We also provide information on the net prices that students and families actually pay after taking financial aid into consideration. The story is a complicated one, with different students paying different prices at the same institutions, depending on their financial circumstances; on their academic qualifications, athletic ability, or other characteristics; and on their year or program of study. [social_blockquote quote="The 2.9% increase in in-state tuition and fees was the smallest increase in over 30 years." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295628664" handle="CollegeBoard" hashes=""]<p><a href="http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/college-pricing-2013-full-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Trends in College Pricing 2013</em></a></p>

<p>The information in this report does not answer all of the questions about the cost of producing education or about the prices students pay, but it does&nbsp; provide a great deal of information that can inform the discussion. A clear message that emerges from the data is that short-term trends can be misleading. In the past few years, as states, institutions, and families have been struggling with the impact of the Great Recession on their budgets, it has been too easy to project the accompanying trend of increasingly rapid price increases far into the future.</p>

<p>The 2013-14 increase in published tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities is the smallest we have seen in many years. This does not mean that college is suddenly more affordable, but it does mean that the rapid growth of recent years did not represent a “new normal” for annual price increases. That said, after large increases in grant aid in 2009‑10 and 2010-11, especially from the federal government, growth in this student assistance has not continued. As a result, many students are facing larger increases in the prices they pay, even in the face of smaller increases in published prices.</p>

<h3>Published Tuition and Fee and Room and Board Charges</h3>
<p>The 2.9% increase in in-state tuition and fees at public four-year institutions in 2013‑14 followed increases of 4.5% in 2012‑13 and 8.5% in 2011-12 and was the smallest percentage increase in over 30 years.</p>

<h3>What Students Actually Pay</h3>
