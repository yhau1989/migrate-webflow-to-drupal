<p><em>While discussion of the government shutdown has shifted to a conversation about the economic implications, John Wildermuth, a longtime writer on California politics, discusses the impact on California lawmakers in respect to the state's new nonpartisan primary system on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/2013/10/new-primary-rules-force-politicians-think/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox&amp;Hounds Daily Blog</a>:</em></p>

<p>"For those folks still saying California’s primary election changes aren’t doing a thing, take a look at the House vote to end the government shutdown.</p>

And unlike officeholders in the safe districts that the state Legislature’s old “incumbent protection” redistricting plan provided before 2012, they know that they will have to explain their votes to everyone in the district, not just their party faithful...</p>

Both Valadao and Miller represent districts with big Latino populations and it turns out that Latinos really, really disliked the government shutdown. A poll released Oct. 17 by the Natural Resources Defense Council found that [social_link quote="82 percent of the Latinos surveyed disapproved of the job Congress was doing" hyperlink="http://ow.ly/q6zaQ" handle="" hashes=""] , 70 percent opposed the shutdown and 71 percent didn’t like the way Republicans in Congress were doing business.

<p>If you’re a GOP congressman in a heavily Latino district, you don’t have to be a political genius to know what the crowd-pleasing vote would be..."</p>
