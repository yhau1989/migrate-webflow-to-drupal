<p>“Hello, I’m Van Jones on the Left.”</p>

<p>“And I am Newt Gingrich on the Right. Welcome to Crossfire”</p>

<p>From the beginning of the show on CNN, the hosts – who interchange from show-to-show with Jones, Gingrich, Stephanie Cutter, and S.E. Cupp – make it clear to the audience that there are only two sides to choose from in whatever hot political topic of the day they are debating with guests who also fall on the “Left” or the “Right.”</p>

<p>Never has there been a show that is more revealing of the motives of the mainstream media to maintain the left-right paradigm, because only one side can be correct, right? You can only find the answer with liberals or conservatives, Republicans or Democrats. There cannot be an alternative view point because it doesn’t make good television. Two people going at each other’s throats makes good television -- going back and forth in a screaming match until the audience only hears chickens clucking.</p>

<p>Newt Gingrich doesn't have all the answers and if he is wrong, that doesn't mean Van Jones is right. We don't live in a world of absolutes. There are many shades of grey that are often ignored by politicians, commentators, analysts, and even the researchers who only want you to view things in two colors.</p>
<blockquote>“I believe the United States Congress has a responsibility to target wasteful spending, pass a responsible budget, and push tax reform that minimizes the tax burden on the American people.”

&nbsp;

“So you are a conservative. Why would you support lawmakers like Ted Cruz and Michele Bachmann?”

&nbsp;

“Actually, I am often openly critical of them.”

&nbsp;

“You liberal.”</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>

<p>In the marketplace of ideas, the current narrative prevailing in American society is that you can only buy into things that are either red or blue when the truth is there are many people in the U.S. who don’t want to buy what is being sold to them. They want more options. Some of us just want to take a canister of gasoline and a lighter and burn the marketplace to the ground.</p>
