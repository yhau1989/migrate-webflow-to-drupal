<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) is hosting an interactive town hall today,&nbsp;<em><strong>Tuesday, October 15 at&nbsp;<em><strong>1:00pm - 4:00pm EST, &nbsp;</strong></em></strong></em>to discuss issues related to electoral reform.</p>
<blockquote>"The event will convene current and former elected officials and election experts for a town hall meeting and panel discussion exploring issues related to elections such as redistricting, primary reform, and resolving disputed elections. With Ohio as the "center of it all" for electoral politics, there's no better place to debate the pressing challenges to our electoral process."</blockquote>
