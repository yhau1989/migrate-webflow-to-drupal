<p>A new party is forming in South Carolina to give voters an alternative option at the ballot box as voters continue to express frustration over the hyper-partisanship in Washington.</p>

<p>From <em>The State</em>:</p>
<blockquote>"COLUMBIA, SC&nbsp;— South Carolina voters who are frustrated over continued political gridlock between the nation’s two political parties may soon have a third option they can support.

&nbsp;

The American Party aims to provide candidate translucency in campaign funding and spending, term limits for candidates and ethical decision making that provides solutions for common interests among the American public.

&nbsp;

Former Democratic South Carolina Superintendent of Education Jim Rex and Oscar Lovelace, a family physician who once vied for the Republican nomination for governor, are in the process of developing the American Party for South Carolina and hope to eventually expand the party to the national level."</blockquote>
