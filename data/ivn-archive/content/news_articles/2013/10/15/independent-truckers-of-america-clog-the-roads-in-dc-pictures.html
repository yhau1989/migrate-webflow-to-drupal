<p>The "Independent Truckers of America" have shut down many highways in Washington DC in what has been billed a "Ride For The Constitution." Part of their message is to tear down the barricades on the veterans memorial.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://ridefortheconstitution.org/trucker-shutdown-oct-11th/" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Let’s show these bastards who runs this place — they will NEVER be able to control a nationwide protest. &nbsp;We are demanding that Congress follow the US Constitution immediately; comply with our lawful demands, or their refusal will cause &nbsp;a shutdown. &nbsp;They either follow along with the plan by October 11th or they will be personally responsible for shutting our system down — they have a choice, but one of them is not to continue to operate lawlessly after October 11th. &nbsp;We have one shot at doing this peacefully; lawfully and constitutionally, but if we do NOT rise up, the alternative is a horrifying collapse and a violent revolution.”</blockquote>
