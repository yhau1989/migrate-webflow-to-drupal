[social_blockquote quote="It’s time to improve our democracy and set an example for the rest of the nation." hyperlink="" handle="@whateversusan" hashes=""] For years, extremists controlled the debate in the capitol. Elected representatives, gerrymandered into districts dominated by their party, were pressed to adopt ever more extreme positions in fear of a primary. Republicans were especially vulnerable, and started to use arcane legislative rules to block, harass, and confound the majority Democrats, ultimately leading to a serious crisis in governance as huge debts yawned and money ran out. Sound familiar? But this isn’t a description of Congress — it’s California, only a few years ago.

<p>But California now is much different. A state that was once called “ungovernable” has now begun addressing many of the pressing issues other states and the federal government face, from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/california-pension-reform-bill_n_1878662.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pension reform</a> to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/10/07/230192101/california-wont-wait-for-congress-on-immigration-reform" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigration reform</a>. There’s no more talk of intractable gridlock in Sacramento, and the idea of California as the poster child for the failed liberal state has largely faded away.</p>

<p>California did it by implementing several <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/editorials/2013/07/10/california-election-reform-is-working.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">successful</a>, common-sense election reforms. First, they got rid of the divisive, low-turnout, closed-party primary that was responsible for so much of the gridlock in the state legislature. In its place, they adopted the kind of innovation that many strong and well-functioning democracies in other parts of the world have embraced; the top-two open primary. Basically they turned what had been a partisan, party-only bonanza for extremists into a two-round election in which everyone participates, and the top two vote-getters in the first round move on to the second.</p>
