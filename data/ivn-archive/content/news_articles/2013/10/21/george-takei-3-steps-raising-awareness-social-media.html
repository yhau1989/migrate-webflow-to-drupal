<p>Actor and gay rights advocate&nbsp;George Takei recently spoke at the&nbsp;National Press Club luncheon on LGBT issues. Among the topics covered in his speech&nbsp;“Embracing Change,” he spoke about his rise on social media and how he utilized the medium to promote his upcoming Broadway musical, <em>Allegiance</em>, to raise awareness on Japanese American internment during World War II.</p>

<p>His ever-growing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/georgehtakei" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Page</a> currently has 4.8 million likes, and over 2.4 million people "Talking About" content posted on his page. His engagement with his fans is the result of a simple, yet tailored strategy, which he describes in his speech:</p>

[heading title="Step 1: Find Your Audience" subtitle=""]

[social_blockquote quote="There's no better way to engage your audience than by making them laugh." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295628183" handle="@JaneSusskind" hashes=""] For Takei, his initial audience was a group of loyal "sci-fi geeks and nerds," who "liked"&nbsp;him because of his role as Hikaru Sulu on Star Trek.

<p>Also an outspoken LGBT rights activist, Takei knew he had a strong base of fans who supported him for his work in activism, a group he started tapping into <em>after</em> he set up his foundation on social media.</p>

<p>This might seem counterproductive if the issue you are trying to raise awareness for is a serious one, but there's no better way to reel your audience in than by making them laugh:</p>

[heading title="Step 3: You Have a Loyal Fan Base, Now Share Important Stuff" subtitle=""]

<p>To appeal to his audience of "sci-fi geeks and nerds," Takei explains, he would say "funny things about sci-fi and science itself and then occasionally throw some serious tidbits in."</p>

<p>Because he had already developed a loyal and engaged audience on Facebook, who "shared" and "liked" his funny posts, he could use that momentum to share meaningful information on Japanese internment, a strategy that proved successful for Takei.</p>

<p><em>"What I've learned is that there are a lot of people out there that you can reach via social media and the best honey to catch those flies with is humor. Something funny will also grab them," </em>Takei concluded with.</p>
