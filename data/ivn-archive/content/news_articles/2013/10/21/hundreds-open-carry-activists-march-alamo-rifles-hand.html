<p>On Saturday, approximately 1,500 gun rights activists gathered at one of Texas' most sacred historical sites, the Alamo, in San Antonio to protest a city ordinance that bans open carry of firearms. According to the local news site, San Antonio Express-News, about a third of the protesters carried rifles, shotguns, and antique pistols as an open display of civil disobedience.</p>

<p>From San Antonio Express-News:</p>
<blockquote>Charged up and chanting, “Live free or die!” protesters at the Come and Take it San Antonio: Line in the Sand rally made their way to the park, a former Confederate hangout in the heart of the city.

&nbsp;

“I intend to defend my life, I intend to fight for my liberty, and carrying a gun makes me happy,” said Wayne Musgrove, a 73-year-old Navy veteran who explained he came to Alamo Plaza to defend his inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

&nbsp;

Blocks away, a much different scene unfolded as about two dozen advocates for more strict gun laws, such as universal background checks and a ban on “militarized weapons,” gathered at the Line in the Sandbox rally organized by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.

&nbsp;

Sandy Phillips, mother of Jessica Ghawi, who died in the movie theater shooting last year in Aurora, Colo., said “common-sense laws” need to be put into place to avert tragedies like the one that killed her 24-year-old daughter.</blockquote>
<p>Concealed carry has been legal in Texas since 1995 and the Texas Legislature has since made a number of reforms which have been friendly to gun rights advocates, but open carry activists say concealed carry does not go far enough to protect individual liberties:</p>

<p>The city ordinance protested was enacted in 1993 and forbids "the carrying of firearms in public parks, at public meetings of governmental bodies, at political events and at nonfirearms-related schools or professional athletic events."</p>
