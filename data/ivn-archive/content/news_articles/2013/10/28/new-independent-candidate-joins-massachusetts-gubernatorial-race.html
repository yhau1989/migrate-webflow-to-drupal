[advertisement title="" type="outset"] Jeffrey McCormick is the latest candidate to enter the 2014 gubernatorial election in Massachusetts. He is best known as the founder of Saturn Partners, a venture capitalist firm established in 1994 to finance early-state growth companies.

<p>McCormick is the second independent candidate to enter the race along with Evan Falchuk, the candidate for the newly founded United Independent Party. He is also not the only venture capitalist in the race as Charlie Baker, the only Republican in the race so far, joined the firm General Catalyst after an unsuccessful 2010 campaign for governor.</p>

<p>From <em>Mass Live</em>:</p>
<blockquote>McCormick, 52, of Boston, also sits on the board of the Sean McDonough Charitable Foundation, the Citi Performing Arts Center, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and Trinity Church Boston. He is a graduate of Syracuse University.

&nbsp;

On the Democrat side, the race for governor next year includes Attorney General Martha Coakley, Treasurer Steven Grossman, former Obama administration Medicare and Medicaid chief Donald Berwick, biotechnology executive Joseph Avellone, former state and federal homeland security advisor Juliette Kayyem and Sen. Daniel Wolf, who has suspended his campaign for now.

&nbsp;

Republican Charlie Baker, who joined the venture capital firm General Catalyst after his 2010 campaign for governor, is the only candidate running so far on the GOP side, while independent Evan Falchuk is running under the banner of his own United Independent Party.</blockquote>
