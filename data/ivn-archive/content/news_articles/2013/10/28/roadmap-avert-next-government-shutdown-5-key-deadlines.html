<p>With a last minute deal on the appropriations bill,&nbsp;the government is back in business, but will have its hands full if they are to avoid the next fiscal speed bump on the road to a budget agreement.</p>

<p>The deal reached earlier this month, just hours before the deadline to default on our national debt, essentially just extended the countdown a few months, raising the debt ceiling until early 2014.</p>

[comment_cta title="Can Congress work together and agree on a budget before Feburary 2014?"]

<p>The&nbsp;Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="http://crfb.org/blogs/taking-another-look-fiscal-speed-bumps-ahead" rel="noopener noreferrer">graphed</a> the key dates coming up (and extending until 2018) in the ongoing debt ceiling debate.&nbsp;Below are 5 key deadlines:</p>

<p><strong>January 1, 2014:</strong> "Doc Fix," farm bill, unemployment benefit expansion, &amp; tax extenders all expire.</p>
<blockquote><em>"On January 1,&nbsp;Medicare provider payments&nbsp;<a href="http://crfb.org/blogs/sgr-bill-good-start-more-can-be-done-less" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be cut</a>&nbsp;by 24% unless a "doc fix" is enacted, the&nbsp;<a href="http://crfb.org/blogs/house-setting-motion-farm-bill-conference" rel="noopener noreferrer">farm bill</a>&nbsp;will expire and prices will revert back to 1949 law, the unemployment benefit expansion will expire, and some "tax extenders" will sunset,"&nbsp;CRFB <a href="http://crfb.org/blogs/taking-another-look-fiscal-speed-bumps-ahead" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>.&nbsp;</em></blockquote>

<p>Both sides agree that there won’t be a “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/both-sides-agree-no-grand-bargain-budget-agreement-in-upcoming-congressional-negotiations/2013/10/25/ea6493d4-3d44-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">grand bargain</a>” on the budget come January 15. Do you believe them?</p>
