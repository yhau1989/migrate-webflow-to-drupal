<p>In a statement made on Wednesday, October 2, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said Obama's fixation with Obamacare is denying World War II veterans their right to visit the war memorial dedicated to them in Washington, DC. As many will recall, Cruz spoke on the Senate floor for more than 20 hours condemning Obamacare and encouraging his fellow lawmakers to defund it and stand their ground even with the threat of a partial government shutdown.</p>

<p>Cruz <a href="http://www.cruz.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=345854" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“President Obama is so fixated on forcing Obamacare on the American people that he's even willing to deny World War II veterans the right to access the memorial they have earned through their heroic service.

"This scenario encapsulates the bigger problem in Washington. President Obama is so set on imposing his destructive, far-left ideology that his government is literally barricading World War II veterans out of their memorial and blocking funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

“The House is on track today to pass individual CRs to fund Veterans Affairs and National Monuments, but Senator Reid and President Obama say they refuse to consider them, even though they agreed to pass a similar CR covering military pay on Monday night.

“This is untenable and our veterans deserve much better, especially our disabled vets. During this debate we should focus on those areas of agreement and pass those CRs. That’s the practical way to proceed and the House deserves great credit for its leadership.”</blockquote>
<p>Much attention on Tuesday in the mainstream media and on social media has been on the barricaded war memorials in Washington and around the nation. The men and women who sacrificed so much in the service of the United States deserve to be able to visit the war memorials dedicated to them and not be turned away because Congress cannot get past partisan politics.</p>

<p>So much can be said about the irony of someone who has made the budget debate about nothing else, but Obamacare, and yet says the White House's fixation with Obamacare is the problem, but Cruz does raise an important point: our veterans deserve better.</p>

<p>There is all this focus on closed war memorials in the nation's capital when the conversation could be on how <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/09/30/what-a-government-shutdown-means-to-military-families-dod-civilians/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vital benefits are being denied</a> to our veterans because the Department of Veteran Affairs is not considered "essential." Disabled veterans may not have access to the assistance they need. Veterans who receive compensation from the VA may not receive checks if the shutdown continues for more than a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>The U.S. House is now trying to do a piece-by-piece approach to restore funding for veteran benefits, the District of Columbia, National Institute of Health, national guard, and national parks. House Republicans attempted to pass <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/326169-house-gop-plans-to-keep-funding-parts-of-government" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 of these proposals</a> on Tuesday in a process that would require a two-thirds vote, which means Republicans needed the support of a fair number of Democrats -- support they didn't get.</p>

<p>The House will consider all 5 proposals on Wednesday, which will likely pass under a simple majority vote. However, Senate Democrats and President Obama say the piece-by-piece approach is nothing more than a political stunt and they will not play the GOP's game. So, the political theater will continue without intermission.</p>

<p>Ted Cruz said our veterans deserve better and they do, but it goes beyond what the senator said in his statement.</p>

<p>The nation's veterans not only deserve the benefits they have earned and the ability to exercise their First Amendment rights by visiting the memorials dedicated to them for their bravery and sacrifice, but our veterans and every single active member of the United States military deserve a better government, a government that doesn't shutdown over petty political squabbles, a government that works to find real solutions to move the United States in the right direction.</p>
