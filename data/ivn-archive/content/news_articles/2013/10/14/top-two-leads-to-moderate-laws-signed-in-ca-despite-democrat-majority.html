<p>The deadline for California Governor Jerry Brown to sign or veto legislation for the 2013-2014 session passed on October 13. About 10 percent of the 896 bills on his desk were vetoed. But despite a democratic majority in the Assembly and Senate, and a democratic governor, the laws that were signed were politically moderate. Why? California's top-two electoral system.</p>

<p>Sacramento Bee columnist <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2013/10/14/5817400/dan-walters-who-won-and-who-lost.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Walters</a> analyzed the "winners and losers" of this year's legislative session. Initially, Walters stated:</p>
<blockquote>Two of the bigger winners were public employee labor unions and groups representing the state’s 3 million&nbsp;illegal immigrants.</blockquote>
<p>He cited laws such as the state minimum wage increase to $10 an hour and the ability for undocumented immigrants to obtain California driver's licenses. However, those were not the only laws passed. He continued:</p>
<blockquote>Another winner was the business community – oddly, one might think, given the big Democratic legislative majorities and a slew of bills sponsored by unions,&nbsp;trial lawyers,&nbsp;consumer activists and environmental groups.</blockquote>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce opposed 38 bills this legislative session, but only one passed -- which was the minimum wage bill.</p>

Both environmental groups and the oil industry were unhappy with the passage of Senate Bill 4, which placed regulations on hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Groups like Sierra Club called for a moratorium on fracking, but Western State Petroleum Association said the bill "create[s] conditions that will make it difficult to continue to provide a reliable supply of domestic petroleum energy for California."

<p>Walters concluded:</p>
<blockquote>The state’s still-troubled economy – and the advent of more Latino legislators from districts with high&nbsp;unemployment rates&nbsp;– may have been factors in why business was successful and environmentalists weren’t this year.</blockquote>
<p>However, a factor that is just as significant could be California's top-two primary system. Instead of voters having to choose between a party nominated candidates in the general election, all voters choose candidates in the primary and the top-two vote getters move onto the general election regardless of party affiliation.</p>

<p>So, how does this lead to moderate legislation? Candidates can no longer rely solely on a party base to propel them through a primary election. By creating same-party general elections in a district that heavily favors that party, a moderate candidate has the opportunity to appeal to a broader base of voters. Once elected, legislators are accountable to that broader base of voters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/2013/10/top-two-system-working-like/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Quinn</a> of Fox &amp; Hounds wrote that the top-two primary did exactly as it intended: create a moderate state legislature. Quinn said:</p>
<blockquote>No longer can a Democrat win the primary in a safe Democratic seat, and coast to an easy election in November.&nbsp; Several safe Democratic districts saw runoffs between two Democrats, and there will be more of these in the future.&nbsp; While the business community had no luck electing Republicans in close contests in 2012, they did surprisingly well in the top two same party runoffs.

&nbsp;

The success of the Chamber in defeating the ‘job killers” in the Assembly and Senate shows the power of the top two system in moderating the legislature.&nbsp; The jury is no longer out on top two, it is working just like it was supposed to.</blockquote>
