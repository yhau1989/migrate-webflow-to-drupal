<p>Following through on an <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/547/Better-Controls-for-Managing-Your-Content" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> they made in December of 2012, Facebook will be removing the option to keep your profile private from public search.</p>

<p>Now, all profiles are available to all users. All you have to do is search.</p>
