<p>House Majority Leader Eric Cantor released the 2014 Congressional calendar this morning with a tweet:</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Congress reduces workdays to 113 in 2014." hyperlink="htt" handle="@JaneSussind" hashes=""]What next year's House Calendar reveals is that despite abysmal approval ratings, worsened by a 17 day government shutdown, Congress has decided to work less.

<p>In 2014, they are scheduled to work just 113 days of the entire year. Compared to 2012's work schedule which consisted of 126 scheduled workdays, that's a significant decrease.</p>

<p>"And for their lack of effort, federal lawmakers are afforded a very comfortable paycheck of $174,000 per year â€” or $3,346 per week, plus full benefits," IVN contributor&nbsp;Wendy Innes <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/09/history-of-congressional-salaries-compared-to-median-worker-wage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>&nbsp;in a comparison of Congress' salaries to that of medium American workers.</p>

<p>Congress has only ever taken a pay cut twice in history, she continues: one in 1874 after the "Long Depression" and the other in 1932-1934 responding to the Great Depression.</p>
