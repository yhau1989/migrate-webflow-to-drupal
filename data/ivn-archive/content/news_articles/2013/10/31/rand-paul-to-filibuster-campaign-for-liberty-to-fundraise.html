<p>Senator Rand Paul issued a letter yesterday to Sen. Harry Reid announcing that he would hold up the nomination of Dr. Janet Yellen as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve unless Federal Reserve Transparency Act (also known as "Audit the Fed"), is also considered.</p>
<blockquote>The American people have a right to know what this institution is doing with the nation's money supply. The Federal Reserve does not need prolonged secrecy-it needs to be audited, and my bipartisan Federal Reserve Transparency Act will do just that. - Rand Paul</blockquote>
<p>Rand Paul issued a video together with John Tate, President of Ron Paul's "Campaign for Liberty." John Tate assure viewers that they will "unleash the biggest threat on the Federal Reserve in history" in the event Harry Reid does not put up the "Audit the Fed" bill up for vote along with the vote on Dr. Yellen's nomination.</p>

<blockquote>This is an historic opportunity in the Senate ... but [Reid] is out of options now if he wants to approve his Chair nominee." - John Tate</blockquote>
<p>“I am writing to convey my objection to floor consideration of the nomination of Dr. Janet Yellen to Chair the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve without also considering legislation to bring much-needed transparency to the Fed,” Paul said in a letter to Reid.</p>

[advertisement title=""]&nbsp;‘[I] will object to any unanimous consent agreement or waiver of any rule with respect to the nomination of Dr. Yellen without a vote on S. 209,” Paul continued. “I know you have been a supporter of similar legislation in the past, and I hope that we can work together to pass this important legislation.”

<p>Paul, who has scored huge points with both Republican and Democratic voters by filibustering the use of drones this March risks damaging his Presidential credentials by using the controversial tactic in partnership with what some consider a polarizing political action committee.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>It is time to rally them to our cause. Will you help Campaign for Liberty take advantage of our historic opportunity to&nbsp;pass the Audit the Fed bill?&nbsp;With the <strong>public spotlight on the Fed</strong> and with the Fed&nbsp;being a major topic of political discussion and debate right now,&nbsp;the first part of our plan has come together for the first time ever. Now its time to finish the job.</div></blockquote>
<div>Harry Reid will not put up S. 209 for vote. This can only mean one thing. The next filibuster is coming. Campaign for Liberty should make a lot of money.</div>
