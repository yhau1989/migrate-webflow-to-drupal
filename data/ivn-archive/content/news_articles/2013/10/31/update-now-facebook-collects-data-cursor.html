<p>Earlier this month, Facebook <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/14/update-facebook-profile-longer-private-search/ " rel="noopener noreferrer">removed</a> the option to keep your profile private from search. Soon after, the company <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/17/profits-facebooks-new-privacy-settings-teens/ " rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> it would be opening up the option to post publicly to teenagers aged 13-17.</p>

[outset type="half"][comment_cta title="Is tracking your cursor movement on Facebook invasive?"][/outset]So news that Facebook is now contemplating collecting data on cursor movement shouldn't come as a surprise. When compared to the types of behavioral data already being collected (and sold) by the company, this new stunt seems trivial.

<p>New types of data Facebook is considering collecting include "did your cursor hover over that ad … and was the newsfeed in a viewable area,” Facebook analytics chief Ken Rudin told the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/10/30/facebook-considers-vast-increase-in-data-collection/." rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>.&nbsp;“It is a never-ending phase. I can’t promise that it will roll out. We probably will know in a couple of months,” he continued.</p>

<p>Currently, Facebook actively collects demographic data, like where you live, and behavioral data, like how you interact with your friends. Facebook's data collection goes so far as to catalog your interaction with your friends in the real world through <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/30/217281470/facebooks-latest-privacy-changes-tag-youre-you" rel="noopener noreferrer">facial recognition</a>.</p>

<p>If Facebook is already collecting a mountain of information on each of its users, why would it need to monitor where our cursors hover? As with most of Facebook's privacy, the answer is simple: money.</p>

<p>It serves Facebook to know where on the site our cursors gravitate in order to better target advertisements. Facebook has not yet finalized whether or not it will fully integrate this practice into their business.</p>

<p>"What this means is that Facebook can gather information about you not only based on information that you choose to share, but by scanning posts that&nbsp;your friends&nbsp;choose to share on the network. Facebook is essentially building the capacity to build an internal profile of any given user — without their consent."</p>

<p>The partnership offers companies targeted ads in mobile apps or on mobile websites based on what is known about that user by Facebook. In conjunction, the companies can now track user tendencies in purchasing items advertised to them on Facebook.</p>
