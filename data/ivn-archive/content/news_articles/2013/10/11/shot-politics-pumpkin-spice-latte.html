<p>Starbucks is no stranger to the political spotlight. They have promoted nationwide programs to build jobs in a slow economy and banned guns from their retail locations after people continued to post images of themselves carrying handguns and rifles openly in stores.&nbsp;Now, the coffee giant has plans to circulate a petition for their customers to sign, telling lawmakers to end the government shutdown, avoid defaulting on the nation's loans, and pass a long-term budget deal that does not just kick the can a little further down the road.</p>

[comment_cta title="Will the Starbucks petition be effective or should the company stick to coffee?"]

<p>Starbucks posted this promoted tweet, quoting CEO Howard Schultz:</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/388711664239247360</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/11/us-starbucks-shutdown-idUSBRE99A04R20131011" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, Schultz said he believed action needed to be taken because of a&nbsp;"sad and striking realization that the American people have no platform with which to voice their frustration and outrage" over Congress' inaction. People have turned to the Internet, but often times the most sensible arguments presented on social media are drowned out by <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/11/twitter-becoming-high-school-political-discourse/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_home&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">counterproductive rhetoric</a> and juvenile status updates.</p>
<p><strong>3 points of the "Come Together" petition:</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Reopen our government to serve the people.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Pay our debts on time to avoid another financial crisis</em></p>
<p><em>3. Pass a bipartisan and comprehensive budget deal by the end of the year</em></p>
<p>Schultz said he is acting as an American citizen and is not approaching this from a business angle though it certainly does put the company back in the national spotlight. Copies of the petition will be located in stores for people to sign, on the front page of the Starbucks website, and in ads published in The New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, and The Wall Street Journal starting on Friday and lasting through the weekend.</p>
