<p>The Supreme Court has heard the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccutcheon-v-federal-election-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission</a> case, which has been labeled <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/11/corruption-watch-here-comes-citizens-united-2-0/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizens United 2</a> by some.</p>

<p>At issue is the aggregation limits placed on political contributors, which refers to the total amount of money a person can contribute to political candidates, parties, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Today, individuals can give to candidates only $2,600 per election, but can give a National Party committee $32,400 per year, State and Local committees $10,000 per year, or a PAC up to $5,000 per year.</p>

<p>The popular discussion centers on a “freedom of speech” v. “quid-pro-quo corruption” concerns; whether aggregate donation limits to political parties and political action committees are Constitutional.</p>

[comment_cta title="And we wonder why organizations have so much power over individual representatives?"]

<p>Not only are limits on giving to groups (parties, PACs, and other political associations) more than 10 times greater in a year than an individual candidate can receive in an entire election cycle, but no one is even challenging those limits in this case.</p>

<p>And we already give special access to our electoral process by paying, with public tax dollars, for parties to hold their private primary elections, to the tune of <a href="http://endpartisanship.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">over $500 million dollars</a> a year.</p>

[social_link quote="However you define corruption and quid-pro-quo giving, the reality is that money finds politics, politicians, and campaigns. " hyperlink="" handle="" hashes="#EndPartisanship"]

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But now, that state of our political discourse has us staking our “freedom of speech” concerns around our ability to contribute to a third party to do our political bidding for us.</p>

<p>No-one asks whether direct donations, with transparency, might actually increase accountability and reduce partisanship.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it make sense that parties have leverage over candidates when political donations have to be funneled through their machines?</p>

<p>Probably why the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RNC-brief-in-12-536.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican Party is the party challenging the aggregate limits</a> as applied to organizations, and not individuals.</p>
