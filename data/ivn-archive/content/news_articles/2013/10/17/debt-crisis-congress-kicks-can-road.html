<p>Congress <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/16/congress-congratulates-job/" rel="noopener noreferrer">congratulated itself</a> for, once again, "saving" us all from its own disfunction. We know by now, however, that there is more can kicking and partisan bickering to come.</p>

[/outset]Although Congress reached a last-minute budget deal, the next critical deadline has been pushed to the end of the year, just in time for it to be <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/15/short-term-budget-deal-sets-stage-for-heated-primary-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">used as a political football</a> during primary elections.</p>

<p>The shutdown was just a small manifestation of more institutional problems in our system of government: that representatives are <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/01/over-100-million-voters-denied-voting-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer accountable</a> to the average voter.</p>

<p>What do we have to look forward to?</p>

<p>Lawmakers and the White House have agreed to fund the government and raise the debt limit for only a few months. &nbsp;You can bet we can expect more of the same, sensationalized headlines, filibusters, and finger pointing.</p>

<p>Even as a deal is approved partisan talking points are appearing on Twitter:</p>
