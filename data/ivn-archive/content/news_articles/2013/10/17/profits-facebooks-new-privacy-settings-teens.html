<p>Facebook <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/737/Teens-Now-Start-With-Friends-Privacy-for-New-Accounts-Adding-the-Option-to-Share-Publicly" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> Wednesday that it will yet again be updating its privacy settings, opening up the option to post publicly to teenagers aged 13-17:</p>
<blockquote>Teens are among the savviest people using social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard. So, starting today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on Facebook.

While only a small fraction of teens using Facebook might choose to post publicly, this update now gives them the choice to share more broadly, just like on other social media services.</blockquote>
[social_blockquote quote="It’s all about monetization." hyperlink="http://a.ivn.us/19PpW2s" handle="@DigitalDemoc" hashes=""] Facebook's manager of privacy and public policy Nicky Jackson Colaco says the&nbsp;move is an attempt to give teens a "public voice" on the Internet. The types of users Facebook hopes to empower are socially active teens, like musicians and humanitarian activists, the New York Times <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/technology/facebook-changes-privacy-policy-for-teenagers.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>.</p>

<p>Critics are skeptical of Facebook's "do-good" intentions, however, with&nbsp;Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy speaking out.</p>

<p>"It’s all about monetization and being where the public dialogue is,” he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/technology/facebook-changes-privacy-policy-for-teenagers.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. “To the extent that Facebook encourages people to put everything out there, it’s incredibly attractive to Facebook’s advertisers.”</p>

<p>The downside? Teenagers do not always know the risks associated with publicly posting on social networks and often times lack impulse control.</p>

<p>So who profits from Facebook's new privacy settings? Is it the humanitarian activist teen who now has access to a wider audience to spread their work and ask for support online, or is it the social media giant, who now gets to <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/31/facebook-and-datalogix-now-they-know-everything-about-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell</a> everything they know about you to advertising companies?</p>
