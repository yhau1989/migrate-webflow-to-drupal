<h2>Unemployment</h2>
[social_blockquote quote="Yes, it is true that more jobs have crept up, but these jobs are not full-time means of employment." hyperlink="" handle="" hashes="#Jobs"] While unemployment is slowly decreasing, hitting a slight decline for the first time in the last 4 years, many American citizens are still concerned about whether or not they’ll be able to run to work on Monday morning. Over 29 percent of employed Americans are slightly concerned about whether or not they will house the same job for the next few years, or if they’ll get laid off due to company downsizings.

<p>Yes, it is true that more jobs have crept up, but these jobs are not full-time means of employment. In fact, these jobs are part-time jobs with a very high application rate.</p>

<p>With high school students quickly jumping into their freshmen year of college, looking to supplement their education with work experience and a few extra bucks, employers are more likely to grasp onto the students who are fresh and new to the whole work scene. These workers are less likely to make demands, and they are more than willing to do whatever work you throw at them.</p>
<h2>Bills, Bills, Bills</h2>
[advertisement title="" type="outset"] Unemployment is a huge issue, but even for the employed bills are main stressors. With the price of gas ping ponging back and forth, the cost of groceries jumping through the ceilings, and the cost of electricity hip hopping every which way, there’s no wonder why we’re concerned about our bills.

<p>While there are several ways to curb your gas and grocery bills, like driving less, carpooling, proper inflation of tires, buying what’s on sale, cooking instead of eating out, etc, there are some bills that feel like they continue to build. It is just one more concern for many Americans in a stressful economy.</p>
<h2>Guns</h2>
<p>In the recent months, Americans have been faced with a large firearm issue. With approximately half of the nation keeping gun laws where they are now and the other half pushing to strengthen the governmental control over who gets to fire what, outsiders may have a slight curious nature as to why our nation is torn over something as trivial as guns.</p>

<p>In September 2013, Aaron Alexis opened fire in the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. He managed to get past security and aim into the cafeteria, killing several people. As many Americans believe mass shootings like this are <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/09/17/overused-talking-points-on-guns-prevent-america-from-moving-forward/" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the rise</a>&nbsp;-- statistically they are not -- many are concerned over guns and gun policy in the United States.</p>
<h2>Terrorism</h2>
<p>Syria’s recent antics involving chemicals, terrorists, and the 300 plus citizens left dead have a lot of Americans teeming with concern. After hearing the president’s plans to make a proactive advance towards Syria, the country was left with an overwhelming fear of another war starting. Those concerned can breathe a slight sigh of relief as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/27/us-un-assembly-syria-resolution-idUSBRE98P1AJ20130927" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia and the U.S.</a> were able to agree to a deal to disarm the Syrians and stop the problem from furthering itself.</p>

<p>Terrorists have also made themselves just a bit more elusive with their tendrils reaching out to every country they can touch. The mall incident in Kenya left hundreds dead, some injured, and more mourning. The group responsible was one of extreme intentions, pinning their actions on religion. Suspected among the group was a small handful of Americans and a British citizen.</p>
