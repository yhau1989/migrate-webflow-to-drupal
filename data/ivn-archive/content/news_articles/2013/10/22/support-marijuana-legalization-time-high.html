[gravityform id="27" name="Do you support legalizing marijuana?" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]For the first time in the history of Gallup, a <p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear majority</a> of Americans (58%) support marijuana legalization.</p>

<p>Not only does this represent an all-time high, but it is an increase of 10 percentage points since last year, implying a drastic shift in public opinion on legalization.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the group which showed the largest increase in public support was independent voters, jumping from 50% to 62% support for marijuana legalization in just one year.</p>

<p>While many factors could be in play, Gallup cites the legalization in Colorado and Washington as a likely contributing factor in the surge of public support. Also in play is the Obama Administration's <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/29/obama-administration-oks-washington-colorado-marij/?page=all" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> not to sue to block these laws, despite their illegality under federal law.</p>

<p>With the Obama Administration essentially paving the way for states to legalize marijuana, <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/03/04/4-states-move-on-marijuana-legalization/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida, Idaho, Maine, and Oregon</a> have recently made efforts to legalize the drug, which remains classified as a <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/04/25/why-is-marijuana-a-schedule-i-drug/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schedule I drug&nbsp;</a>under the 1970's Controlled Substance Act.</p>

<p>In California, efforts have resulted in the&nbsp;2014 California Cannabis Hemp&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/20/authors-of-ca-2014-cannabis-initiative-most-comprehensive-effort-yet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Initiative">Initiative</a>, named "the most comprehensive effort" to legalize marijuana in the state yet.</p>

<p>"Whatever the reasons for Americans' greater acceptance of marijuana, it is likely that this momentum will spur further legalization efforts across the United States," Gallup <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>.</p>
