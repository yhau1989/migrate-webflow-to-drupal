<p>Rand Paul spoke with Fox news yesterday about the government shutdown and the debt ceiling. While some may see an irony in Rand Paul suggesting that our political leaders not try and strike "grand bargains" and instead focus on the things where we can come to an agreement, others may see his ability to compliment the President on the way he handled Syria as a sign that he is willing to work together.</p>

<blockquote>"We tend to try and fix everything at once in a grand bargain...why don't we instead work on the 20% we agree to." - Rand Paul</blockquote>
