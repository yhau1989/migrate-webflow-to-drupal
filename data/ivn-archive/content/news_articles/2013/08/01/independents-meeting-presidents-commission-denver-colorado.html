<p>In one week,&nbsp;on August 8, 2013 a group of independents will meet in Denver, Colorado.&nbsp; Among them will be Catana Barnes, President, Independent Voters of Nevada who will be traveling from Nevada with statements from herself and other leaders in the Western region, presenting 1,000 signatures from fellow independent voters to the President's Commission on Election Administration at the Denver hearing.</p>

<p>We're still making progress, but as independents in the western region we must continue to be heard, to make sure that the commissioners addresses the serious deficit in our electoral process; stand and be counted with those who have already made important progress in removing the roadblocks to a true democratic process, one which does not disenfranchise almost half of all American voters.</p>

<p>Independents now account for more than 40% of the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/151943/record-high-americans-identify-independents.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electorate</a> in the US&nbsp;elections, yet our voice is still not heard <strong><span>as the majority that we in fact are</span></strong>.&nbsp; We’re forced to stand aside and watch in horror, frustration and dismay at our dysfunctional, tumultuous, severely partisan politicians as they listen only the banging drums of their party’s messages, frozen in a permanent state of stalemate.</p>

<p>It’s beyond time to bring change, to bring true democracy to our elections wherein all may be counted. Through apathy created by decades of disenfranchisement, millions of voters are disassociating themselves from partisan politics and we must take action now by taking advantage of the opportunity presenting itself to us; the opportunity of making our independent voices heard with all the collective power it has.</p>

<p>The partisans may certainly be shrinking in numbers, but unless we stand up for our constitutional rights, the power will remain with the shrinking minority voice. &nbsp;And what a terrifying thought that is.</p>

<p>Quieting the voices of independents to the point of nullification, acquiescing to those who have manipulated the democratic process for the benefit of the few is tantamount to ushering autocratic rule to the front-row seats of our government.</p>

<p>I cannot help but recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.”</p>
<p><i>“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”</i></p>
<p>Certainly, when Dr. King made this profound statement the circumstances were very different, but I say today, they are no less dire as we face an obstacle that can dismantle the very essence of what this nation was built upon.</p>

<p>Undemocratic processes anywhere is a threat to democracy everywhere……..Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.</p>

<p>Please help take the number of signatures of independents to the Commission over a thousand by&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGZSZWpXd0lsWmZZd0d0NEJrWlNsaFE6MA#gid=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">signing the Letter</a> to the President’s Commission on Election Administration right away. &nbsp;Let your voice ring loud.</p>
<p><em>“Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other." <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_10.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Madison, Federalist #10</a></em></p>
