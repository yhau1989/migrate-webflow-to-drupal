<p>As we continue talking about ways to stop the proliferation of firearms in the United States; as we seek a civilized discussion about the best way to treat the gun violence in this nation; as we continue to maintain the number one slot in gun related deaths/homicides in the world, Arkansas is arming teachers and staff members with guns.</p>

<p>Some seem to have forgotten while they're arming teachers the lessons <em>(we should have)</em> learned of arms proliferation during the Cold War, the message repeated time and again throughout history; one nation builds a bigger and better weapon, so others must follow suit; massive battleships, faster fighter aircraft, aircraft carriers, giant nuclear submarines.&nbsp; The lesson that arms races bring with them a quick and violent, albeit seemingly not long remembered, end to the race.</p>

<p>More guns lead to battles with more guns! &nbsp;How long will it be before we're arming teachers with fully automatic assault weapons in order for them to "outgun" their more heavily armed opponents?</p>

<p>I sincerely hope I’m wrong on this count, but I remember arms and troop build-up during the War in Vietnam, the arms proliferation during the cold war wherein we quite literally lived face-to-face with the end of the planet in a war no one could possibly win.</p>

<p>I hope beyond hope I'm wrong, yet I feel the same unsettling, gut-wrenching, worry creeping into my mind that I had during the utter insanity of the nuclear arms race and the very strong possibility of world-wide nuclear warfare. &nbsp;Now Arkansas has begun its own arms race by arming teachers and staff members, giving them the oh so extraordinarily heavy burden of strapping on a very deadly weapon before going to work; going to work to educate our children.</p>

<p>Let’s, for a short moment, not consider the insanity of a misinterpreting Arkansas' law which entitles Arkansas schools to use armed guards, a law that now has as many as 20 staff members from teachers to principles packing loaded weapons among children in <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/arkansas-school-arming-teachers-article-1.1412540" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarksville, Arkansas</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s not consider the insanity that some arbitrary number of 53 hours makes one capable of making decisions with a gun in their hands.&nbsp; 53 hours!&nbsp; That’s little more than 4 days!&nbsp; In 4 days one can mingle with rowdy children who do unruly things daily, sometimes very unruly things and they can mingle with those children with loaded guns, despite the warnings of a <a href="http://www.schoolsecurity.org/trends/arming_teachers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">PROFESSIONAL</a> school security service.</p>

<p>New York <a href="http://www.troopers.ny.gov/Academy/Firearms/" rel="noopener noreferrer">State Police</a> require law enforcement officers to undergo 90 hours and must score a minimum of 80% &nbsp;accuracy and they must do this semi-annually. &nbsp;<span>These are trained professionals,</span> not educators carrying the responsibilities of a secondary role as an armed guard.</p>

<p>Let’s not consider for a moment that very few people, even those who are trained for all of 53 hours, can react rapidly and skillfully to a stressful event, much less to a stressful event with a gun in their hands, a gun that may in all likelihood kill innocent students by accident, either through misinterpretation of what a student is doing, or via a ricochet fired by a 53 hour trainee.</p>

<p>Let’s do consider one very serious issue I see on the horizon; the issue that tells our children it’s OK to pack heat for protection, children who will in all likelihood parrot the educators, for that’s what children do.&nbsp; Let’s consider the implications that this will, not may, but WILL promote gun proliferation among students.</p>

<p>Arkansas is a wonderful place, but if I had children attending school in Clarksville, I would either be home-schooling or moving to a city with sanity in its school board.</p>
