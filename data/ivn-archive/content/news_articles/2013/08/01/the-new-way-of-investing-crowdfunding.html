<p>Crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals who network and pool their resources, usually via the Internet, to help fund or start a business, project or cause.</p>

<p>In recent years, crowdfunding has become a growing alternative to traditional investment techniques. The amount of money raised by crowfunding grew from $1.5 billion in 2011 to $2.8 billion in 2012.</p>

<p>Its difference between crowdfunding and traditional capital venture that make it an attractive alternative:</p>

<p>- It allows a company to find funding at a lower cost.</p>

<p>- It allows for more creative and non-traditional ideas, who might be too risky for capital ventures, to find the necessary funding.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding has gain much more recognition with a couple of high profile projects that raised millions of dollar. Two movie projects <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veronica Mars</a> and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1869987317/wish-i-was-here-1?ref=home_popular" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wish I were Here</a>&nbsp;respectively raised $5.7 and $3 million on Kickstarter, one of the main crowfunding site.</p>

<p>However, compared to capital ventures, crowdfunding remains a much less stable ressource.</p>

<p>The status of crowd investors remains however vague. The <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-28/crowdfunding-sites-scoot-around-a-regulatory-traffic-jam" rel="noopener noreferrer">JOBS Act</a> signed by President Obama in 2012 had a section dedicated to issue of crowfunding and would have allowed small companies to sell shares over crowdfunding platforms.</p>

<p>The JOBS Act will apply to companies raising $1 million or less with investors investing up to $2,000. But the SEC has yet to formalize the rules allowing this to happen.</p>

<p>In the meantimes, companies raising money through crowdfunding are using other incentives to convince investors to invest in there project. These incentives vary from tee-shirts, prototypes, behind the scene footages to meeting the team behind a project.</p>

<p>This has been successful so far but to become a true alternative investment method, the SEC will have to establish the rules that will regulate that new industry.</p>
