<p>The first filing period for campaign finance has passed and the prospective candidates for California Governor in 2014 have reported.</p>

[social_link quote="Governor Brown's re-election campaign has raised over 2.8 million " hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=868" handle="@JerryBrownGov" hashes=""] between January 1<p><sup>st</sup>&nbsp;and June 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of this year. In comparison, his prospective opponents, former Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado and Assemblymember Tim Donnelly, raised a little over $400,000 combined in the same time period.</p>

[advertisement]The Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) has Brown with a 54 percent approval rating among likely voters. Brown' approval rating polled at 67 percent with Democrats, 29 percent with Republicans, and 44 percent among independents.

<p>Brown led the way to a balanced approach to the <a href="http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2013-14/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">state's budget</a>. Under Brown, California attained $1.2 billion in surplus, a stark contrast from the states' $42 billion <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-01-15-schwarzenegger-california-deficit_N.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">deficit</a> just four years earlier.</p>

<p>Brown's biggest <a href="http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1333789&amp;session=2013&amp;view=received&amp;psort=AMOUNT" rel="noopener noreferrer">donor</a>&nbsp;so far is the Democratic State Central Committee of California,&nbsp;which donated $900,000 to his reelection campaign. He also received donations from notable groups such as Wal-Mart, the California Nurses Association, California School Employees Association and several Indian tribes.</p>

<p>Asm. Donnelly, who has raised $83,000. is pushing tax reform as one of the main <a href="https://www.electtimdonnelly.com/issues.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a> in his platform:</p>
<blockquote>“By relieving businesses of the burden of high taxes, we can open the doors for growth and expansion, creating greater opportunity for job creation and a prosperous economy.”</blockquote>
<p>Donnelly has currently received most of his <a href="http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1354289&amp;session=2013&amp;view=received&amp;psort=AMOUNT" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign funds</a> from individual donors.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="One of his past and most significant campaign contributors has been Altria, parent company of Philip Morris." author=""]&nbsp;One of his past and most significant campaign contributors&nbsp;has been Altria, parent company of Philip Morris. Aside from candidate committees, notable donors have included Pechanga Band of Lusieno Mission Indians, AT&amp;T, and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association.

<p>Maldonado has <a href="http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1356799&amp;session=2013" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised over</a> $300,000, and has over $44,000 left on hand. Most of his contributions for the 2014 gubernatorial race have come from individual donors. In the past, he's received donations from the California Trucking Association, AT&amp;T, California Housing Council and Pechanga Band of Lusieno Mission Indians.</p>

<p>Maldonado has been <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-pc-maldonado-slams-browns-handling-of-prison-overcrowding-20130802,0,6428506.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">outspoken</a> against realignment and Brown's handling of the overcrowded prisons situation. He stated,&nbsp;"I would have demonstrated to the courts that I was moving forward with increasing capacity to hold some hardened criminals in California."</p>

<p>Maldonado was a <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_14,_Top_Two_Primaries_Act_(June_2010)" rel="noopener noreferrer">prominent supporter</a> of California's Proposition 14, the top-two, nonpartisan primary system.&nbsp;The 2014 election will be the first gubernatorial election conducted through California's new primary system.</p>

<p>While it's still early, Brown's challengers will need to step up their fundraising efforts if they hope to be competitive in the race for California governor.</p>
