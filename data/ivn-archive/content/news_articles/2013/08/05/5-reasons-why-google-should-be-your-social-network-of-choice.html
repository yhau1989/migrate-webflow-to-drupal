[pullout_blockquote quote="80% of Google+ users engage on a weekly basis" author=""] Since the creation of GooglePlus (commonly referred to as Google+) back in 2011, the social network has received mixed reviews, with criticism centered around the lack of meaningful content and low levels of user engagement. Despite the skepticism, however, the once "invitation-only" social networking site has blossomed into the second largest social network in the world, passing Twitter in January 2013.
