<p>According to PPIC’s 13th annual <a href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_713MBS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> on the environment, half of California residents now believe global warming to be a “very serious threat” to the state’s economy and quality of life. Although 11 percent of Californians believe the effects of global warming will never happen, most state residents (63%) say the effects have already begun.</p>

<p>As a result of climate change, cities are&nbsp;<a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205919/#r46" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected</a> to grow still warmer in the coming years with “more intense, more frequent and longer lasting” heat waves. With one in five natural hazard <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205919/#r5" rel="noopener noreferrer">deaths</a> in the U.S. caused by extreme heat events, 57 percent of California residents say they are very concerned about more-severe wildfires and 49 percent express concern over more-severe droughts.</p>

<p>Dr. George Benjamin, the executive director for the American Public Health Commission, said in a <a href="http://newamericamedia.org/2010/04/latinos-african-americans-willing-to-pay-more-to-slow-climate-change.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that the effects of climate change have disproportionate adverse health consequences for African Americans and Latinos. <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205919/#r17" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies</a> of extreme heat have shown racial disparities in heat-related deaths, and Latinos (67%) and blacks (63%) are far more likely than whites (40%) or Asians (38%) to say global warming is a very serious threat.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205919/" rel="noopener noreferrer">research paper</a> published by Environmental Health Perspectives, urban tree canopy is an important local mitigating <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205919/#r19" rel="noopener noreferrer">factor</a> for extreme heat; its benefits, including reduced air and noise pollution, have been associated with reduced mortality. Research indicates that disparities in urban tree canopy are “usually in the direction of racial/ethnic minorities living in neighborhoods with lower tree coverage.”</p>

<p>Additionally, impervious surfaces such as asphalt and concrete, which play a strong role in <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205919/#r56" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating</a> urban heat islands, are more likely to be found in areas with a low socioeconomic status and a high proportion of minority residents.</p>

<p>While Latinos (41%) and blacks (40%) are much more likely to express the view that air pollution is a big problem in the region where they live, the majority of Californians agree that air pollution is either a big problem (28%) or somewhat of a problem (34%). 65 percent of Californians now agree that the government should act right away to cut emissions by passing regulations and spending money on efforts to reduce global warming.</p>

<p>The PPIC survey found majority support for policies being proposed and enacted at both the state and federal levels to address global warming; 53 percent of adults say that government is still not doing enough.</p>
