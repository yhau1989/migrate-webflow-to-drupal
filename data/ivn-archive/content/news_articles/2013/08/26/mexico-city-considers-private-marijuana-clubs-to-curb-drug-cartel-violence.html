<p>Representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States were in attendance for a three-day forum in which Mexico City council members discussed the possibility of making modifications to the current drug policy.</p>

<p>“We will be very responsible in this debate,” Manuel Granados declared, chair of the city council Governance Committee. “In Mexico City we agree on replacing criminal policies with health policies. We are ready to hold this debate and, at the right time, to legislate.”</p>

<p>Presently the cultivation and retailing of marijuana is <a href="http://the420times.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">illegal</a>, but the country does allow adults to possess up to five grams of dried flowers. Hmm, you can’t grow it or sell it, but you can possess five grams. So I guess it falls from the sky, right on!</p>

<p>While the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, has taken a stand for the legalization of marijuana, Mexico’s current president, Pena Nieto, is hardheartedly opposing the legalization of the plant. President Nieto is actually hoping to apply stricter sentencing for drug traffickers and producers.</p>
