<p>FairVote, a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing civic participation, feels it has the solution to an increasingly polarized House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The increase in <a href="http://ivn.us/infographics/2013/08/16/where-does-partisan-bias-come-from/" rel="noopener noreferrer">partisan bias</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://ivn.us/infographics/2013/08/08/what-causes-congressional-gridlock/" rel="noopener noreferrer">polarization </a>visible in the House of Representatives and Senate have a common root, the electoral process. With confidence in Congress at an <a href="http://ivn.us/infographics/2013/08/19/confidence-in-congress-continues-to-drop/" rel="noopener noreferrer">all time low</a>, now may be the time for a serious reevaluation of our election system. FairVote proposes a Fair Voting Solution.</p>

<p>Currently, the American election process is a winner-take-all battlefield. A candidate that wins fifty plus one percent of a district ultimately represents 100 percent of the population. Under FairVote's proposal, this hallmark of the American political process would be changed.</p>

<p>When combined with independent redistricting commissions, states would elect representatives based on the proportion of votes they receive, over a certain threshold. For example, if Party A receives 25 percent of the votes in a district with 4 seats, then that party will be granted 1 seat within the district.</p>

<p>This would pave the way for more accurate representation of diverse interests. In addition, the proposed system would overhaul the meticulous practice of gerrymandering and reduce the amount of districts within each state. Similar systems have been implemented at the state and local level.</p>

<p>Whether or not the American electorate will be comfortable switching voting systems remains to be seen. Yet, extending such a system to the national stage could change the makeup of Congress in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
