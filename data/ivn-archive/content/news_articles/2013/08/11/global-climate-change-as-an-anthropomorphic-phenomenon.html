[advertisement]Global Climate Change Part 3 of 4: &nbsp;Au naturale or anthropomorphic? That is indeed the debate.

<p>If one reads even the most benign of scientific reports, it would be impossible to deny the obvious global climate change beseeching our home, the only home we have; Planet Earth.</p>

<p>With mean global temperatures rising higher and the duration of which are now far longer during the late 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century and early 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century than at any other time in the past 2000 years, completely incontestable facts absolutely refute any possibility that the more recent extreme global climate change is anything other than anthropomorphic.</p>

<p>As if we aren't getting hot enough, we return to the heated debate; <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page4.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural VS anthropomorphic</a>!</p>

<p>Mother Nature does in fact oscillate quite regularly (<b><i><span>remember that word</span></i></b>), creating global climate change throughout history and even somewhat predictable when viewing long-term data and the affects shown by Mother Nature herself in signs ranging from tree rings to ooze on the bottom of lakes and the oceans.</p>

<p>Natural events such as the eruptions of volcanoes&nbsp;<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page4.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">El Chichón, Eyjafjallajökull</a>&nbsp;and Pinatubo have all contributed to global climate change. &nbsp;Variations in radiation from the Sun, Earth's slight wobbles and even oceanic currents such as El Niño&nbsp;and&nbsp;La Niña have played a part in recent global climate changes.</p>

<p>Remember that word "regularly?"</p>

<p>Here's the part that has an overwhelming number of the science community so very concerned: &nbsp;Since the beginning of time, Mother Nature's changes have become semi-predictable using scientific evidence and data gathered around the globe. However, beginning around the mid 20th Century, her historic past has been interrupted, her cycles altered and we've entered into a realm of the unknown, a realm in which global climate change can best be described as irregular, extreme events.</p>

<p>We're not just talking serious tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, etc. we're talking the wildest tantrums from Mother Nature we could conceive; extremes from crop-destroying drought in areas normally wet, those areas from where much of our food comes. As warmer weather causes water to evaporate (<i>remember; water vapor is a key component to global warming</i>) severe floods occur in cities and suburbs, but we continue paving our way to "success."</p>

<p>Deforestation to make way for the concrete jungle in urban areas; enabling farmers and timber industries to thrive in rain forests reducing the available canopy which produces the oxygen we and our fellow earthlings breathe combine to increase the surface temperatures of the planet. &nbsp;And, with each action we create even more breeding grounds for global climate change.</p>

[related_posts title=""]

<p>Wait! &nbsp;There's more! &nbsp;Melting <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/causes" rel="noopener noreferrer">glaciers</a> and permafrost reduce the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiation reflective capabilities</a>&nbsp;of our planet, adding to the endless cycle of change. Increases in <a href="http://www.livescience.com/topics/global-warming/" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse gases</a>&nbsp;accumulate heat melting &nbsp;glaciers and allowing radiation to reach our plant, thereby increasing the rate of global climate change.</p>

<p>This vicious circle has changed Mother Nature's "regularity" and with each anthropomorphic change the cycle is entrenched deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>Given such undeniable proof and immense volumes of&nbsp;<a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientific evidence</a>,&nbsp;we can no longer deny th e reality; extreme global warming, creating global climate change, is anthropomorphous in nature.</p>

<p>Drastically altering Mother Nature’s regular cycle of weather changes and worse; her natural ability to absorb the shock, she may no longer be able withstand the onslaught of humanity. &nbsp;We have changed her entire global makeup and she's on the hospital bed with life support attached.</p>

<p>The overwhelming evidence is; global warming since the mid 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century, since the Industrial Revolution, has made itself known with a ubiquitous and ominous presence in our lives.</p>

<p>So. &nbsp;Say you're one of those with their <a href="http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Main_6%20Reasons%20Youre%20Ignoring%20Global%20Warming.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">head in the sand</a>, can you tell me; are there any signs in that sand?</p>
