<p>Congressional gridlock is the norm in today's polarizing political climate. Although voters are content with keeping the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/08/07/hey-voters-congressional-gridlock-is-kind-of-your-fault" rel="noopener noreferrer">same people</a>&nbsp;in office despite record lows of approval, the cause for this phenomenon can be rooted to the lack of Congressional moderates, which also means the lack of "bridgebuilders."</p>

<p>Bridgebuilders are the men and women in Congress with incentives that transcend partisan politics, voting on an issue regardless of affiliation. However, with today's almost evenly-split electorate and congressional terms primarily focused on reelection, there is little to no cause to vote across party lines.</p>

<p>Couple this with the nation's current infatuation with primary races appealing to largely partisan voters, and you've got yourself a perfect, real-life example of an unstoppable force colliding with an immovable object.</p>

<p>The current number of moderates in Congress is six.</p>

<p>The 113th Congress is projected to have even less moderate members than the current cycle, resulting in a higher polarization rate. What will it take to rectify this situation?</p>
