<p>A Quinnipiac poll <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/new-jersey/release-detail?ReleaseID=1933" rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a> Newark Mayor Cory Booker leading the New Jersey Senate race with 54 percent of likely Democratic voters. Booker is well ahead of Republican front-runner Steve Lonegan 54 to 29 percent in a projected general election matchup. The U.S. Senate seat was vacated when Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, passed away in early June due to complications from pneumonia.</p>

<p>The Quinnipiac poll found:</p>
<blockquote>"Newark Mayor Cory Booker has a seemingly unbeatable lead in next week's Democratic Senate primary in New Jersey... A total of 65 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, including 66 percent of Booker backers, say they definitely will vote for the candidate they have named."</blockquote>
<p>Democratic primary voters are all Booker needs to secure the vacant Senate seat due to New Jersey's closed primary system. <a href="http://nj.gov/state/elections/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to the New Jersey Secretary of State, in order for a non-affiliated voter to participate in the New Jersey primary he or she needs to affiliate with the party of the candidate they choose.</p>

<p>Unless you are a first time or unaffiliated voter, you have to register with either the Democratic or Republican Party 55 days prior to the primary election. If you are a first time or unaffiliated voter, the 55 day period does not apply, but you are compelled to register with one of the parties to cast a vote.</p>

<p>New Jersey is <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/06/18/independents-exceed-party-registration-in-5-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer">home</a> to 2.6 million independent voters, which make up 48 percent of the electorate. Democrats are the second largest voting bloc at 32.8 percent and Republicans comprise 19.6 percent of voters.</p>

<p>By declaring themselves independent from a party, independent voters have intentionally and willfully chosen not to affiliate with the GOP or the Democratic Party. Ultimately,&nbsp;2.6 million independent New Jerseyans would be forced to sacrifice their First Amendment right of disassociation if they wish to participate in a primary system that is designed to insulate partisan candidates from the broader electorate.</p>

<p>Maurice Carroll, the director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute asserted the election has become a formality, saying, "Unless the sky falls, Newark Mayor Cory Booker can start looking for a Washington apartment. He dominates both the Democratic primary and a general election against Steve Lonegan."</p>

<p>If Booker faced a more formidable primary opponent under an open primary system, the special election&nbsp;might include more than 9 percent of eligible voters and current predictions have voter turnout at a much lower percentage than that. It appears the general election is all but decided when it comes to New Jersey's next senator even though the primary election is next week.</p>
