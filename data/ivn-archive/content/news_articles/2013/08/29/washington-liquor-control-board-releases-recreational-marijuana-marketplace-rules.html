According to said rubrics, the state of Washington will be permitted to produce, at most 40 metric tons, or 2 million square feet, of marijuana on an annual basis.

There will be a total of 334 retail outlets permissible statewide with each county having its own limit of allowed establishments. Seattle will be allowed 21 of the aforementioned 334 outlets, which is diminutive compared to the current one hundred-plus medical dispensaries located in the city.

The production limitation of 40 tons calculates to roughly 1.4 million ounces of dried flowers, which seems a tad bit low seeing as how the guesstimations of statewide marijuana consumption were made via a pre-legal marketplace.

The rules were reportedly drafted with the intention of limiting monopolies. Producers and retailers are both limited to three licenses each, and retailers can only own up to 33 percent of the marijuana retail outlets in the city or county.

“I think (it) avoids the type of market dominated by a few large players, which I think, (according to) the input we received, people wanted to avoid, which could drive up prices and encourage the type of aggressive marketing that I believe we want to move away from,” board member Chris Marr explained.

The list of rules also consists of three production tiers which include less than 2,000 square feet, 2,000 to 10,000 square feet, and 10,000 to 30,000 square feet with the grow floor space being capped at 2 million square feet.

This means that a <strong><a href="http://the420times.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recreational marijuana</a></strong> retail shop that is located across the freeway from a school won’t be prohibited lest a school-aged child can legally walk 1,000 feet and reach said retail outlet.

The Board proclaimed that the rules in question were updated in response to feedback, but also z`“to meet the eight federal government enforcement priorities.”

The Washington Liquor Control Board’s chairperson Sharon Foster declared that the state’s first recreational marijuana store will prospectively be open by June of 2014. <a href="https://lcb.app.box.com/proposed-rules-9-4-13" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click right here </a>to read a copy of the state’s rules and regulations.
