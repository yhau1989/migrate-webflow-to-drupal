<p>The rallying cry in the 1770’s was “Taxation Without Representation”.&nbsp; They fought a war over it and THEY won.&nbsp; But we are still losing.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, many counties have a bizarre system to guarantee representation of a minority party.&nbsp; The counties have 3 commissioners and have written the laws to stipulate all 3 cannot be from the same political party.&nbsp; On the face of it that is fine and good.</p>

<p>However, in practice, this needs some tuning.&nbsp; The reality is voters can only vote for 2 commissioners.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Even though there are 3 slots open, you can only vote for 2 people!</strong></p>

<p>Since a party can only capture 2 of the 3 slots, the major parties only put up 2 candidates for the 3 slots.&nbsp; The campaign becomes - ‘Vote for our team of two people to become the majority’.&nbsp; If a major party put up 3 candidates you would have one of the candidates as an odd person out, siphoning votes from the other 2 major party candidates on the ticket.&nbsp; Or worse, a team of 2 insiders would be working against their teammate even before facing the other party’s team.&nbsp; As a party, it is just smarter to put 2 people up and not have a fight you do not need.</p>

<p>The issue is - somewhere along the way the general public lost the ability to vote for all 3 slots.&nbsp; Maybe hyper-partisanship took over to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>If we can’t run three people, why would we allow the public to vote for three people?&nbsp; </em>

<em>If the public were to use that other vote they would start to look at the other party as a viable place to send that vote.&nbsp; </em>

<em>We would be allowing the other party into the system.</em></blockquote>
<p>The general election becomes a game of musical chairs where 4 candidates vie for 3 slots.&nbsp; This is where one of the parties perceives that they are in a weaker position and one of the candidates from the ‘weaker’ party begins to ‘cut’ their running mate by making a deal with the ‘stronger’ party.</p>

<p>It becomes a mess.</p>

<p>A solution to hyper-partisanship in this case may be to allow voters to cast a ballot for each open seat.</p>

<p>Keep the parties sending up two people for their tickets, but allow voters to make a selection for EACH seat open.&nbsp; That third vote floating out there could go to the other major party candidate or to an alternate party candidate.&nbsp; Alternatively, the voter could bullet vote their party’s slate (only cast 2 of their three ballots).</p>

<p>The choice of the voter would be made by the person casting it – and not restricted by a warping of party politics.</p>
