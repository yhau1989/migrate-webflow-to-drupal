<p>The Federal minimum wage has created much debate over the years from all different sides of the aisle. Is it too low, too high, should there even be a minimum wage?</p>

<p>Former Congressman Dennis Kucinich would argue that the minimum wage is too low:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We, the taxpayer, are subsidizing basic living needs for persons making minimum wage when <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fabout%2Fresources%2Fbuttons&amp;text=%22Employers%20should%20be%20paying%20a%20livable%20wage%20to%20begin%20with.%22%20-%20%40Dennis_Kucinich%20%23FightFor15&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fa.ivn.us%2F14bxRpz&amp;via=ivn" rel="noopener noreferrer">employers should be paying a livable wage to begin with.</a>&nbsp;</em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/share" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></em></p>
<p><em>Many low-wage employers spend the money they could have used on wages to pay ever-increasing excessive executive salaries and bonuses in the millions. ~Dennis Kucinich</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other end of the aisle former Congressman Ron Paul advocates getting rid of the federal minimum wage completely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Minimum wage laws &amp; mandating union contracts (closed shop) are designed to help a small segment of workers gain economic advantage while actually hurting unprotected workers. Long term, even the beneficiaries suffer from the unemployment that excessive wage demands bring about. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fabout%2Fresources%2Fbuttons&amp;text=%22High%20wages%20are%20great%2C%20but%20if%20there%20are%20no%20jobs%20they%20become%20meaningless.%22%20-%20%40RonPaul%20%23FightFor15&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fa.ivn.us%2F1586ay0&amp;via=ivn" rel="noopener noreferrer">High wages are great, but if there are no jobs they become meaningless.</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/share" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a>
