<p>Dear IVN Readers,</p>

<p>While much of the mainstream media is covering the same old stories with tired talking points, check out some of the discussions on IVN, like:</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/12/alternative-minimum-tax-unfairly-taxes-middle-class/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alternative Minimum Tax</a>&nbsp;is and how it affects the Middle Class? Did the Supreme Court just rule that cell phone companies&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/09/no-reasonable-expectation-to-privacy-for-cell-phone-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer">own your personal information</a>?
