<p>Solar energy is transforming the energy market. In places like California, for instance, sunshine is not only fueling our electricity grid, but has fueled our economy, <a href="http://ivn.us/california/2013/04/19/california-leads-nation-in-solar-jobs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">employing&nbsp;43,700</a> people in the solar industry.</p>

<p>But just how affordable is it to "go solar" right now and when will solar energy get cheap?</p>

<p>This question is explored by Alexis Madrigal, <i>The Atlantic</i>'s senior technology editor, in a six-part series on "how energy really works in America."</p>

<p>The cost of solar photovoltaics cells, she argues in this clip, has dropped an average of 20% every time the world's manufacturing capacity has doubled.</p>

<p><em>Essentially, the more solar energy you produce, the less it costs.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This, of course, is referring to the cells used to produce energy, and does not account for the set up. In fact, cells only account for 50% of the cost of the solar module, which leaves the additional&nbsp; cost of installation, financing, wiring, converters, and storage a major obstacle to solar power.</p>
