<p>The effects of poverty on Americans' mental health is still not fully understood. Previous in-depth <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/12/child-poverty-remains-an-important-issue-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">coverage</a>&nbsp;has fleshed out the ongoing problem of the 16.2 million children living in poverty, but what's occurring mentally in these neglected pockets is universal, regardless of age.</p>

<p>The poverty line now sits at an annual salary of $11,500 for an individual. Add a child and a partner into the mix, and the poverty line increases by $6,000 for this demographic.</p>

<p>Fifty-one percent of Americans are expected to live in poverty before the age of sixty-five. African Americans and Native Americans are hit hardest by this epidemic, comprising about one in four for each demographic.</p>

<p>This has a huge impact on those already suffering from a lack of income. Depression was&nbsp;<em>five times as likely&nbsp;</em>to appear with those living below the poverty line from 2005 to 2010. This can help explain the heightened suicide rate in 2008, the year the Great Recession began.<em>
</em></p>

<p>About 39 percent of the homeless are affected by mental illness, most notably schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</p>

<p>With few resources to pay for medication or treatment, those living in poverty are less capable of coping with afflictions in a healthy manner. Ultimately decreasing chances of employment, thus perpetuating minimal income and unchecked mental complications.</p>

<p>It's a real chicken-and-the-egg scenario. Which came first, the poverty or the illness? And how can the cycle be broken? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.</p>
