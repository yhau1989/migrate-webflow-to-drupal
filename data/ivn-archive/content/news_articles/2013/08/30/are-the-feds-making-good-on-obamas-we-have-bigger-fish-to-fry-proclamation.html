<p><img alt="DEA badge C Are The Feds Making Good On Obamas We Have Bigger Fish To Fry Proclamation?" height="199" src="cloudinary://DEA_badge_C.png" title="Are The Feds Making Good On Obamas We Have Bigger Fish To Fry Proclamation? photo" width="141">On Thursday, our beloved Department of Justice <a href="http://the420times.com/2013/08/are-the-feds-making-good-on-obamas-we-have-bigger-fish-to-fry-proclamation/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>offered a microscopic level of assuredness</strong></a> to “jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing marijuana in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana.”</p>

<p>So, are the proclamations that the Department of Justice are outlining in the latest “Memorandum for All United States Attorneys” worth less than the paper that it is printed on? How can we trust a government that has been lying to us for decades regarding the medicinal legitimacy of marijuana? Is this just another war mongering tactic to divert our attention from the pointless attack on Syria?</p>

<p>This is the very same government that holds a patent on Cannabidiol (CBD) but refuses to reform the laws regarding marijuana on a federal level. Sorry, but I’m still having a hard time believing anything they say. Call me once bitten, twice shy if you will, but I don’t trust liars.</p>

<p>“As the Department noted in its previous guidance, Congress has determined that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of marijuana is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels. The Department of Justice is committed to enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act consistent with those determinations,” so states the memo.</p>

<p>Hmm, so <a href="http://the420times.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congress admits that keeping marijuana illegal “is a serious crime</a> that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels,” oh wait, that’s the truth and they wouldn’t admit the truth! The only thing hazardous about marijuana is the fact that “Congress has determined that marijuana is a dangerous drug” which merely helps further the special interest group’s agenda to continue profiting from prohibition.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice hasn’t vowed to turn a blind eye toward states “that have enacted laws legalizing marijuana in some form,” they have simply stated that the “Department’s guidance in this memorandum rests on its expectation that states and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuana-related conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests.” In other words, they will still intervene if they see fit.</p>

<p>Yes, they have stated that the “Department is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way,” but they also claim that “as several states enacted laws relating to the use of marijuana for medical purposes, the Department in recent years has focused its efforts on certain enforcement priorities that are particularly important to the federal government,” which they assert to include, but is blatantly obvious to anyone with eyes, not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;</li>
	<li>Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;</li>
	<li>Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;</li>
	<li>Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;</li>
	<li>Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;</li>
	<li>Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;</li>
	<li>Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and</li>
	<li>Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://the420times.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/legalize-sign.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="legalize sign Are The Feds Making Good On Obamas We Have Bigger Fish To Fry Proclamation?" height="225" src="cloudinary://legalize-sign.jpg" title="Are The Feds Making Good On Obamas We Have Bigger Fish To Fry Proclamation? photo" width="225"></a>As far as the “firearms” and the “drugged driving” goes, those topics are subjects for another debate, heaven knows no one drives while intoxicated on prescription drugs or alcohol in this country, or elects to exercise their right to bear arms, but the 6 remaining points of interest that our cherished Department of Justice (Ha-ha, “justice,” what a joke!) has outlined can be easily solved by legalizing the plant on a national level for adults for any dedication they see fit, whether it be recreational, medical, wellness or industrial purposes.</p>

<p>Just think of the things the government could waste our country’s revenue on if they cut the Drug Enforcement Administration’s budget to zero. The possibilities are endless, but I have faith that they would find plenty of ways to hemorrhage cash into other pointless entities such as the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p>For those individuals that are taking the Department of Justice at their word, just remember, these are the same governmental officials that allow countless individuals to perish needlessly by continuing to keep the medicinally legitimate marijuana plant illegal under the Controlled Substances Act and are contributing to an act of genocide, plain and simple.</p>
