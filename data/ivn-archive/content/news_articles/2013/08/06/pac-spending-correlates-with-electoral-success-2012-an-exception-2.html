<p>Money in politics is rising to the fore as one of the key issues worth evaluating in American political discussion. Political Action Committee (PAC) spending has doubled over the past 7 election cycles and these organizations find themselves at the center of this discussion, as the campaign spending that these organizations undertake cloud transparency in campaign finance.</p>

<p>OpenSecrets.org compiled&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/list.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="data">data</a> on PAC contributions to federal candidates, categorized by industry. The rising amount of money flowing through PACs may be one of the many factors that fuel&nbsp;the fire of partisan politics in the capitol.</p>

<p>Here are 5 illuminating trends in PAC spending:</p>

<p><strong>1.)</strong> From 2000 to 2012, most PAC spending by industry has doubled; total PAC spending has increased by more than double.</p>

<p><strong>2.)</strong> PACs from Agribusiness, Construction, Energy, Miscellaneous Business, and Transportation, favored Republican candidates in every election cycle.&nbsp;PAC funding overall was also&nbsp;strongly in favor of Republican campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>3.)</strong> Lawyer, Lobbyist, and Labor Industry PACs always favored Democratic campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>4.)</strong> Defense, health, and other single issue PACs almost always supported the winning presidential candidate. These organizations favored Republican campaigns&nbsp;every year from 2000 until 2008.&nbsp;In 2008, when President Obama was elected to his first term, PAC money shifted with the popular vote, finding its way back to the Democratic side of the aisle.&nbsp;Their funding continued its Democratic support in 2010 as the party held the White House in the off election year. In 2012, however, the PACs from these industries&nbsp;favored Mitt Romney, marking their first departure from a winning candidate.</p>

<p><strong>5.)</strong> Overall PAC spending almost always favors the party who wins the White House -- 2012 was the exception.</p>

<p>In 2012, PAC spending brought $247.4 million to Republican candidates, and $205 million to Democratic candidates. It was the only election cycle on record where the candidate with the most supporting PAC money did not win the White House.</p>

<p>This departure can lead one to wonder what made 2012 different. Perhaps the deeper question is not what happened with the system in 2012, but rather, is a system that consistently equates large sums of money to political victory acceptable?</p>

<p>The early numbers on PAC spending for the 2014 election cycle place <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Northrop Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a>&nbsp;as the highest donor thus far.</p>

<p>The global security company is one of the leading producers of drones, and other military-based technology. At the moment, it is the PAC responsible for the most donations to the Republican party, and fourth most to Democratic campaigns.</p>

<p>With PAC money so closely related to success and important to running a campaign, how much voice does the individual voter have? Even if the voter does have a voice in the fight between the two major parties, is there room for meaningful change within the current system of campaign funding and elections?</p>
