<p>Dear IVN Readers,</p>

<p>Some news outlets will filter out news on important issues to showcase stories for their entertainment value. As a result, some issues are never even brought to the surface, like:</p>

<p>How many voters are truly&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/01/over-100-million-voters-denied-voting-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied voting rights</a>&nbsp;nationwide? Does a&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/the-public-mind/2013/08/02/independents-engage-the-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">“bipartisan” election commission</a>result in real reform? What does a&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/08/01/russia-begins-blacklisting-websites-under-version-of-sopa/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian version</a>&nbsp;of the Stop Online Privacy Act mean for future legislation here in the US?</p>

<p>IVN brings you unfiltered news on the biggest issues that go unreported on in the mainstream media. Be sure to check out the latest articles and column updates from independent-minded contributors dedicated to bringing you stories that matter to you.</p>

The media, the US Justice Department, and respected civil rights organizations continue to argue about issues like Voter ID, felon voting, and the Voting Rights Act. But, as their boxing arena becomes full of political talking points and pontificating pundits, a much bigger fight is going on outside.

America isn't the only nation struggling with online piracy. Two anti-piracy bills approved by Russian leader Vladimir Putin have received criticism for seeking to blacklist entire sites hosting pirated content, rather than deleting or censoring the specific content in question.

<h1><a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/29/california-initiative-seeks-to-revolutionize-privacy-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Initiative Seeks to Revolutionize Privacy Policy</a></h1>
This landmark initiative could completely change the way privacy policy is addressed in California by giving plaintiffs the teeth necessary to actually protect their constitutional right to privacy in a courtroom, and flipping the responsibility of protecting personal data from the individual to those who actually possess the information itself.

The following is a transcript of the initiative’s amendments to the state constitution [updated to reflect recent amendments to the initiative]:
<blockquote>SECTION 1.&nbsp; Whenever a natural person supplies personally identifying information to a legal person that is engaged in collecting such information for a commercial or governmental purpose, the personally identifying information shall be presumed to be confidential and the legal person collecting such information shall use all reasonably available means for protecting such information from unauthorized disclosure.

SEC. 2.&nbsp; Harm to a natural person shall be presumed whenever his or her confidential personally identifying information has been disclosed without his or her authorization.

SEC. 3.&nbsp; Confidential personally identifying information may be disclosed without authorization if there is a countervailing compelling interest to do so (such as public safety or protected non-commercial free speech) and there is no reasonable alternative for accomplishing such compelling interest.
