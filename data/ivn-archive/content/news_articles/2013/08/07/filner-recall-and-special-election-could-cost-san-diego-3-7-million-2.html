<p>San Diego news has been dominated by allegations of misconduct by Mayor Bob Filner, but common discussion surrounding the controversy has overlooked the financial cost to the city.</p>

<p>If Mayor Filner is recalled, the city will have to hold a special election to select a replacement. As a consequence, the city must pay for the administrative costs of this election.</p>

<p>The Filner scandal is new territory for San Diego, a city where there has not once been a Mayoral recall.&nbsp;The legal steps a petitioner for recall must take are outlined by <a href="http://docs.sandiego.gov/municode/MuniCodeChapter02/Ch02Art07Division27.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">municipal code</a>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>File a petition for recall with the City Clerk</li>
	<li>Publish a notice of 300 words or less in a city paper stating their intent to circulate the petition</li>
	<li>File an affidavit of publication with the city clerk</li>
	<li>Serve notice on the official to be recalled</li>
	<li>Await the official’s published response of 300 words or less in the city paper</li>
	<li>Circulate the petition to be signed in print by residents</li>
	<li>Acquire 15% of the signatures of all voters in the city</li>
</ol>
<p>The timeframe for a special election is also outlined by municipal code:</p>
<blockquote>If a special election is called, it shall be held not less than sixty (60) days after&nbsp;adoption of the ordinance calling the election but not later than ninety (90) days after&nbsp;such adoption.</blockquote>
<p>While the city and the mayor quibble over who should pay Filner’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/dueling-bids-get-underway-to-recall-san-diego-mayor-at-center-of-harassment-claims/2013/07/29/a3169ecc-f8bc-11e2-a954-358d90d5d72d_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="legal expenses">legal expenses</a>, the largest potential expense from the controversy will belong to the taxpayers.&nbsp;If the recall petitions are successful, the special election will cost the city a sum well in excess of the legal fees.</p>

<p>Recent special elections have cost San Diego a significant amount. The&nbsp;special <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/29/county-registrar-suggests-other-options-costly-spe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="election">election</a>&nbsp;to replace now congressman Juan Vargas in April for California's 40<sup>th</sup> Senate District cost $1.1 million, according to <a href="http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/voters/Eng/Eabout.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Michael Vu">Michael Vu</a>&nbsp;of the San Diego County Registrar of Voters. The low turnout resulted in the cost being about $30 per voter.</p>

<p>The San Diego City Council also held a special election earlier this year to replace Tony Young, now CEO of the local Red Cross chapter. It was held for only <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/citycouncil/cd4/index.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">District 4</a>&nbsp;voters of San Diego, but cost the city&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/29/county-registrar-suggests-other-options-costly-spe/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$355,000</a> to administer.</p>

<p>There are over 63,000 <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/city-clerk/pdf/voterstats.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">registered voters</a> in San Diego's District 4 and over 670,000 registered city-wide. Based on the cost of the council's special election per registered voter, a mayoral special election could cost approximately $3.7 million for the city to administer.</p>

<p>While the price of voter influence regarding a city’s pride in its mayor is not an occasion for thrift, the cost of a potential special election should be considered when assessing the damage done to the city of San Diego.</p>
