<p>In response to the growing privacy concerns, local law enforcement agencies in Maine are now required to have a warrant to track cell phone activity.&nbsp; Passed on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_126th/chapters/PUBLIC409.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">LD415</a>&nbsp;reads: "a government entity may not obtain location information without a valid warrant issued by a duly authorized judge or justice."</p>

<p>It defines government entity as&nbsp;"a state or local agency," clarifying that federal agencies are not bound by the warantless cellphone tracking state laws.</p>

<p>The law goes on to mandate that in the event that law enforcement agencies <em>do</em> obtain a search warrant, that they notify the user within three days of tracking "<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/10/new_maine_law_prohibits_warantless_cellphone_tracking.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">unless</a>&nbsp;they can prove that secrecy is necessary in order to delay the notification for an unspecified period."</p>

<p>Unlike many laws attempting to protect the privacy of cell-phone users, Maine's new warrantless cellphone tracking law extends the requirement for a warrant to the history of location information, meaning that law enforcement agencies cannot snoop into a users phone records for past locations or check-in information.</p>

<p>This is a clear departure from the Department of Justice's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment as made clear in a brief filed on the applications of the United States of America for historical cell-site data. In the <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/Document-56.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief</a>, the DOJ specifically argues that "customers have no protected privacy interest in historical cell-site records," citing<em> United States v. Miller</em> (1976).</p>

<p>Their reasoning lies in the fact that historical cell-phone records are stored by cell phone companies, or third-parties, and â€œthe Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities" (<em>United States v. Miller</em>).</p>

<p>There is only one state ahead of Maine in the fight against warrantless cellphone tracking: Montana. Historically becoming the first in the nation to pass such legislation in late June, Montana's law also requires law enforcement to obtain a probable cause warrant before tracking a person "based on his or her <a href="http://www.aclu.org/locationtracking" rel="noopener noreferrer">cell phone location information</a>, social networking check-ins, or via a GPS tracking device in a criminal investigation," the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-national-security/first-nation-montana-requires-warrant-location" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>.</p>

<p>On the privacy front, other states making history include Texas, which just became the first state to enact legislation requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant in order to sift through people's personal emails.</p>

<p>With states taking the lead with privacy protection laws, it's only a matter of time before Congress responds.</p>
