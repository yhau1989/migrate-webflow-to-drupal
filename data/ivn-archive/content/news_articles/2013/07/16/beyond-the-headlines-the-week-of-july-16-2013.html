Dear IVN Readers,

It's a shame that our 24/7 mainstream media rarely finds the time for stories of substance.&nbsp; One station literally participates in a revolution on the other side of the globe, then ignores the real-world devastation their power vacuum has created so they can bring you 25 hours of commentary on a tragic, but straightforward, criminal trial. Another station spends 26 hours telling their viewers why the other station has made the trial a political issue.

At IVN, we are on a mission to go "Beyond the Headlines" and bring you original stories from independent journalists that go beyond the half-truths, political posturing, and, shallow debate. And we are proud to bring real news by a wide range of independent contributors.

Thank you for being a part of IVN and we hope you enjoy the update for this week.

- Shawn and rest of the IVN Team

In 2010, California voters passed Proposition 14, which converted elections for the state legislature to a nonpartisan top two primary system.

This allows voters to select their preferred candidate...

<a href="http://ivn.us/icon/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ICON</strong></a>&nbsp;is short for “Independent Conservative.” For many years the term “conservative” has gotten muddled and today differs little from the Republican Party’s orthodoxy of the moment. Operating as an arm of the Republican Party rather than as an independent philosophy has robbed the conservative of his effectiveness as a true adversary against the predations of the modern state.
