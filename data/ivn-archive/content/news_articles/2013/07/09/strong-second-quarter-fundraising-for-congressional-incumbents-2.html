<p>The 2014 midterm election is more than a year away. Nevertheless, congressional incumbents have been busy gearing up for the ever-longer campaign season. The fundraising deadline for Q2 was June 30 and fundraising powerhouses like Paul Ryan and Lindsey Grahm have continued to post seven figures.</p>
<h5>Paul Ryan - Wisconsin</h5>
<p><a href="http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00330894/876098" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Federal Elections Commission filings, Congressman Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) was able to raise $1.1 million in the span of three months. Ryan's camp now has $2.2 million on hand, a modest sum compared to several of his congressional colleagues.</p>
<h5>Mark Udall - Colorado</h5>
<p>Although disclosures with the FEC have not yet been released, Senator Mark Udall's campaign (D-Colorado) <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2013/07/01/still-without-an-opponent-sen-mark-udall-raises-another-1-3-million-for-re-election-bid/97806/" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the Denver Post it had raised over $1.3 million by the June deadline and has $3.4 million on hand. Udall is currently unopposed, State Sen. Randy Baumgardner is said to announce his underdog candidacy Friday. It is likely Udall's multi-million dollar lead will prove insurmountable.</p>
<h5>Mark Warner - Virginia</h5>
<p>With $5.3 million in cash on hand Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) was able to <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/warner-raises-million-in-second-quarter/article_c51dafd1-6066-5fc1-adfb-4745aacd8b48.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise </a>$1.4 million in the second quarter. Despite being considered a slam dunk for 2014 according to Public Policy Polling, the highly popular Senator continues to produce big numbers for his reelection campaign. The PPP poll found, "53% of Virginians approve of the job Warner is doing to only 27% who disapprove. He's at 58/25 with independents."</p>
<h5>Mary Landrieu and Rep. Bill Cassidy - Louisiana</h5>
<div>Facing off for Louisiana's Senate seat, incumbent Mary Landrieu (D) and challenger Congressman Bill Cassidy (R) both disclosed their fundraising totals early. Having <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/309861-landrieu-cassidy-post-big-fundraising-hauls-for-louisiana-senate-race" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised</a> $1.7 million and $1.1 million respectively, the Louisiana Senate race is off to an early start. Landrieu holds about $4.9 million on hand whereas Cassidy is sitting on $3.2 million, nearly 500 days ahead of election day.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Significant fundraising will only increase throughout the year, and could set the foundation for a record-setting midterm election season. If previous trends persist, congressional fundraising in 2014 will likely match or even exceed 2012's staggering $3 billion price tag.</div>
<h4>Update 7/12/13:</h4>
<h5>Mitch McConnell - Kentucky</h5>
<p>At the top of the second quarter charts for congressional incumbents thus far is Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). He raised $2.2 million following April's reporting deadline. <a href="http://www.bgdailynews.com/news/state/mcconnell-adds-more-than-m-to-campaign-account/article_e4d9d112-337b-5ac3-b4e3-ce839addfcbb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Park City Daily News, the incumbent Senator now has $9.6 million cash on hand.</p>

<p>Attack ads have already started against his challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, including this one from Mitch McConnell's campaign:</p>
