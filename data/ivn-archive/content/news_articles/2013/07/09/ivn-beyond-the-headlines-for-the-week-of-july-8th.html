<span>On Friday, delegates to the 2013 National Education Association Representative Assembly in Atlanta, Georgia formally adopted a new policy statement coming out in support of digital learning, while maintaining support for traditional teacher-led education.

<span>California has reduced its prison population by over 50 percent in a little over a year by rerouting low-level offenders to county jails and encouraging alternatives to incarceration. Core sentencing and pretrial detention reform recommended by the ACLU was, however, attempted and failed by the 2012 state Legislature.</span>

<span>A month ago, Edward Snowden lifted the veil that the National Security Agency had shrouded: the proof of citizens' digital information being infiltrated. This came after Director James Clapper explicitly stated to the press that his agency did not use its technology to these ends.</span>

<span>COPPA was implemented in 1998 and is designed to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Under COPPA, website operators must give notice to parents of any child under the age of 13 that they are using their child's information and acquire parental consent before they save any of this information.</span>

<span>The New Jersey Legislature goes on summer recess most years for all of July and August. In the weeks preceding this break, members of both houses increase their activity, attempting to vote on legislation before two months go by without any possibility for action. This year, the state's legislative body attempted to address issues of gun control, rent control, and campaign finance reform<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/03/new-jersey-fails-to-pass-campaign-finance-reform-to-increase-transparency/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>

<h1><span>IVP Submits Initiative to End Taxpayer Funding of Political Parties</span></h1>
<span>The “End Taxpayer Funding of Political Parties” initiative would prohibit the State of California from spending taxpayer funds and using state administrative resources to run private party elections and encourage the parties to voluntarily use the results of the nonpartisan open primary to select Presidential convention delegates.</span>

<span><a href="http://ivn.us/end-partisanship/2013/06/26/ivp-submits-initiative-to-end-taxpayer-funding-of-political-parties/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Read online.</span></a></span>

<div>

<span>Despite the&nbsp;U.S. Supreme Court ruling&nbsp;that political parties are ‘private organizations’, taxpayers continue to pay for their private partisan activities — even though the parties repeatedly assert their right of “private association” in their efforts to prevent the over&nbsp;40% of voters who&nbsp;self-identify as independent voters from exercising a meaningful vote.</span>

<span>Public elections would not be effected by IVP's initiative. California would continue to administer the state-funded nonpartisan primary system, whereby all candidates and all voters participate in a single-ballot primary.</span>
