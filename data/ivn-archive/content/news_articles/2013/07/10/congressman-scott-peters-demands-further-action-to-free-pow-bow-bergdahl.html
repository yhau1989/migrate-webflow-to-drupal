<p>On Wednesday, U.S. Representative Scott Peters (D-San Diego) introduced a <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/sites/scottpeters.house.gov/files/Bergdahl%20POW%20Resolution.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressional Resolution</a> calling for further diplomatic efforts to free Army Sergeant Bowe Robert Bergdahl.&nbsp;Bergdahl is currently the only American prisoner of war (POW) being held in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"Veterans in San Diego and across the country are thinking about Sergeant Bergdahl and his family, and they asked me to make sure he is not forgotten. That is the purpose of this resolution,” Peter said in a press release. “This is a complex situation, but I will monitor it closely and will push the administration to keep it as a priority. Given what Sergeant Bergdahl and his family have sacrificed, they deserve our time and attention."</p>

<p>The resolution follows a <a href="http://scottpeters.house.gov/sites/scottpeters.house.gov/files/img-709145324-0001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> the congressman sent to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday formally requesting a review of efforts that have been made and are currently being made to bring Bergdahl home.</p>

<p>Bergdahl was taken captive on June 30, 2009 while serving in the mountainous regions of southeastern Afghanistan by a militant group allied with the Taliban known as the Haqqani network. According to reports, the Taliban has demanded a monetary ransom, as well as the release of Afghan and Pakistan prisoners in exchange for his release.</p>
