<blockquote><strong>Quote:</strong> “I am committed to maintaining open avenues of communication with my constituents in Maine in order to best serve their interests. To that end, social media is an invaluable tool in connecting me with people from across the state – hearing their concerns and opinions – and improving overall correspondence.&nbsp; I hope Mainers across the state will take advantage of <a href="http://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-announces-social-media-platforms" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Social media to connect with Angus King">social media to converse with me</a> and my staff.”</blockquote>

<p>This week we recognize US Senator Angus King for our social spotlight. Sen. Angus Stanley King, Jr., former two year Governor of Maine, began his avid involvement in social media in 2012 to promote his policies and political independence in his successful campaign for Maine's available Senate seat.</p>

<p>At the culmination of his tenure as governor in 2003, King was widely favorable. When King decided to re-enter the political landscape as a Senator, social media allowed him to efficiently reassert his political appeal to the people of Maine. King's application of Facebook during his 2012 campaign allowed voters to reconnect with him personally and gain insight to his aspirations as Senator.</p>

<p>On his<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SenatorAngusSKingJr" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Facebook</a>&nbsp;page, King reflectively posted photos from early on in his career as governor to remind voters of his achievements. He currently uses it to voice his opinion&nbsp;about legislation and local issues, allowing him to remain proactive on issues important to his constituents</p>

<p>Additionally, King continues to share photographs of himself interacting with locals at campaign rallies, town hall meetings, and festivals, adding a personal touch to his social engagement.</p>

<p>Although he only recently joined&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/SenAngusKing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, King's genuine use of his profile has rewarded him with a diverse collection of followers amounting to an online fan-base of over 3,000. On Twitter, King highlights his public appearances by reminding constituents to watch interviews, as well as tweeting and re-tweeting pictures and articles relevant to his followers.</p>
