A plurality of registered voters in the US have chosen not to identify with a political party, one sign that the influence of the two major parties is receding. The west coast — Oregon, Washington, and California — a region that has traditionally been thoroughly Democratic, is beginning to see a party identification shift.

<h1><a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/29/california-initiative-seeks-to-revolutionize-privacy-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Initiative Seeks to Revolutionize Privacy Policy</a></h1>
This landmark initiative could completely change the way privacy policy is addressed in California by giving plaintiffs the teeth necessary to actually protect their constitutional right to privacy in a courtroom, and flipping the responsibility of protecting personal data from the individual to those who actually possess the information itself.

The following is a transcript of the initiative’s amendments to the state constitution [updated to reflect recent amendments to the initiative]:
<blockquote>SECTION 1.&nbsp; Whenever a natural person supplies personally identifying information to a legal person that is engaged in collecting such information for a commercial or governmental purpose, the personally identifying information shall be presumed to be confidential and the legal person collecting such information shall use all reasonably available means for protecting such information from unauthorized disclosure.

SEC. 2.&nbsp; Harm to a natural person shall be presumed whenever his or her confidential personally identifying information has been disclosed without his or her authorization.

SEC. 3.&nbsp; Confidential personally identifying information may be disclosed without authorization if there is a countervailing compelling interest to do so (such as public safety or protected non-commercial free speech) and there is no reasonable alternative for accomplishing such compelling interest.
