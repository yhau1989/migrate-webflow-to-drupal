<p>Dear IVN Readers,</p>

<p>As the media brings you 24/7 news coverage of a British baby, we are proud to do real investigative reporting on things that matter to the foundation of our democracy and a productive civil discourse.</p>

<p>Follow along this week as we cover the Hawaii Democratic Party's attempt to prevent nonaffiliated voters from having the right to participate in the primary elections, or the Republican v. Independent head-to-head match-up in the 52nd district resulting from California's new nonpartisan primary system.</p>

<p>We won't bring you babies, and we won't build up headlines just to let you down. We are committed to elevating democracy beyond the superficial two-party debate, and we thank you for being a part of it.</p>

<p>Until next week, join us on IVN.us,</p>

<p>- Shawn and the rest of the IVN team.</p>

New York conducts closed primary elections where only those registered with the party can participate and all polling thus far has run along partisan lines. It is difficult to say where the Democratic mayoral candidates stand in the eyes of independent-minded voters.

In response to Senate requests, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel detailed a bleak future if sequestration is not resolved by the end of the fiscal year.

The report, which documents the ideological position of congressional coalitions from both parties since the 1940s, shows that as the two parties have evolved with time, they've evolved in opposite directions. While the Democratic Party has been becoming gradually more liberal, the Republican Party has been getting more conservative, and doing so at a much faster rate.
