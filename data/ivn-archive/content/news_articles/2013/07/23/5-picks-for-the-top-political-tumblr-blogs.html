<p>Currently, Tumblr hosts <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/tumblr-user-stats-fact/" rel="noopener noreferrer">125.7 million blogs</a>. Tumblr's micro-blogging format allows users to post text, photos, quotes, links, music, and videos easily from a computer or smartphone. While Tumblr appeals largely to a younger audience, politicians and political groups have been increasingly using the platform to share information in a coherent, clever, and thought-provoking manner.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are 5 of the top political Tumblr blogs that effectively use the features unique to Tumblr for political purposes:</strong></em></p>

<h2><b>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://statedept.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of State </a></b></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of State uses photos, video clips, rhetorical questions, links to articles, and quotes on their Tumblr in order to inform viewers of the Department's achievements in diplomacy.</p>

<p>The Department is also effective in cross promoting their other existing social networks using Tumblr; for example, posting a link and image advertising their upcoming Google+ Hangout.</p>
<h2>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://campaignmoney.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Campaign Action Fund</a></h2>
<p>Public Campaign Action Fund is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that uses Tumblr to help achieve its goal of improving current campaign finance laws and rallying for political reform. The presence of political cartoons, videos, surveys, and charts on this Tumblr page makes it not only effective, but also intriguing for political junkies on Tumblr.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="http://whitehouse.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The White House on Tumblr</a></h2>
<p>While Tumblr launched back in 2007, it took the White House a few years (or six) to create an official Tumblr Page. The tech savvy team, however, has been hard at work since its launch on April 26, 2013, with their <a href="http://whitehouse.tumblr.com/post/48938628507/the-white-house-tumbling-things" rel="noopener noreferrer">first post </a>outlining exactly what to expect on the new blog.</p>

<p>As reported back in <a href="http://ivn.us/social-ballot/2013/04/26/white-house-to-start-tumbling-things/" rel="noopener noreferrer">April</a>, "With citizens still recovering from the political hangover that resulted from the 2012 election, Tumblr could be just what the White House needs to encourage political engagement in a less formal atmosphere."</p>
<h2>4.&nbsp;<a href="http://sunnyinkabul.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's Always Sunny in Kabul</a></h2>
<p><img alt="kabul use" height="160" src="cloudinary://kabul-use-250x266.jpg" width="150"></p>

<p>"It's Always Sunny in Kabul" is a blog designed to reveal the complexities of America's involvement in Afghanistan through images, quotes, and first-hand accounts. A combination of clearly reflective content with satire creates a juxtaposition in the blog that is compelling. This blog has it all: videos, memes, pictures, articles, links, and quotes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.&nbsp;<a href="http://cartoonpolitics.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartoon Politics</a></h2>
<p>The power of political cartoons in pointing out social ills dates back to the days of Thomas Nast, who used cartoons to expose the corruption of Boss Tweed and his Tammany Hall to those who could not read in New York. On the "Cartoon Politics" Tumblr, one can find political cartoons discussing everything from education to religion; healthcare to gun control, making it one of the most comprehensive accounts on the Internet.</p>
