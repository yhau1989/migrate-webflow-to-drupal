<p>Some of the largest known reserves of natural gas are located in the United States; our country alone has an estimated 2,400 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/clean-money-clean-energy/2013/07/17/fracking-potential-in-california-is-vast-but-barriers-stall-process/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fracking</a>, the process of injecting gallons of water, sand and chemicals underground at a great pressure in order to extract gas and oil from shale rock formations, allows companies to obtain hard-to-reach resources.</p>

<p>If fracking continues, it will provide over half the energy supply of the U.S. in only 2 years.&nbsp;Proponents of hydraulic fracturing also argue that natural gas could replace coal and oil as the major energy source worldwide, subsequently reducing CO2 emissions by more than 50 percent.&nbsp;The continuance of fracking could mean independence from foreign energy sources and, consequently, a decrease in&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/clean-money-clean-energy/2013/07/30/wholesale-electricity-prices-have-increased-by-59-in-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer">energy costs</a>.</p>

<p>Among the consequences of hydraulic fracturing are contaminations of groundwater, the release of methane - a gas 20 times as potent as CO2 - and the induction of earthquakes. In 2009, Oklahoma - a state that averages 50 earthquakes per year - experienced over 1,000 earthquakes which have been <a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2013/03/26/G34045.1.abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked</a> to fracking.&nbsp;Tap water associated with fracking has actually caught fire.</p>

<p>Some argue that the public has been poorly informed about the fracking process, leading to exaggerated concerns about the effects -- for example, straightforward mining causing a number of earthquakes over time.</p>

<p>T. Boone Pickens, the chair of the BP Capital Management hedge fund, claims that despite having “worked on over 2,000 fracking wells,” he has “seen no environmental issues as a result.”</p>
