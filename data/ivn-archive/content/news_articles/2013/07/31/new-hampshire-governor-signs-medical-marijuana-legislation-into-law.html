<p>New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan has <a href="http://rt.com/usa/new-hampshire-medical-marijuana-542/" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially signed legislation into law</a> making her state one of 19 throughout the nation to allow the use of marijuana for medicinal dedications.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in both legislative houses overwhelmingly approved the proposed legislation back in June; it was just a matter of waiting for Governor Hassan, who said she would sign the bill, to exercise her pen-wielding hand to finalize the bill’s treacherous journey through the gauntlet of legislative scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Allowing doctors to provide relief to patients through the use of appropriately regulated and dispensed medical marijuana is the compassionate and right policy for the state of New Hampshire, and this legislation ensures that we approach this policy in the right way with measures to prevent abuse,” Hassan reportedly declared in a statement.</p>

<p>The bill states that those patients that are suffering with a “chronic or terminal disease” or “debilitating medical conditions” may register for the program. Once qualified, registered patients would then be permitted to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, which they would have to obtain from a nonprofit marijuana dispensary.</p>

<p>Initially the bill allowed for patients to cultivate the plant in the privacy of their own homes, but political pressure mounted on Governor Hassan to have the measure rewritten to exclude home cultivation.</p>

<p>The law will allow for the licensing of up to four marijuana dispensaries in the state, each of which will be permitted to cultivate a maximum of eighty marijuana plants and possess eighty ounces of marijuana, which calculates out to be approximately six ounces per registered patient.</p>
