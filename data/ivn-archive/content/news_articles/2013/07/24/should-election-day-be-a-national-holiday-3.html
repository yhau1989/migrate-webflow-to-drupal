<p>Previously I had written about making Columbus Day Weekend’s Monday our national election day. It was to be called Rediscover America Day in the non-election years to coincide with Columbus Day. In the odd number years people would be encouraged to rediscover the roots of our nation, where we’ve been together as a democratic republic, and dream where we might go together.</p>

<p>Then I heard about making Veterans Day election day, and I was immediately sold. What could be more poetic than voting on a day that honors those who fought to keep our country safe? And lest we forget, we are voting for those who will have the power to put our fellow citizens in harm's way. There are few on any sides of the political quadrants—left, right, freedom, and order—who haven’t questioned the necessity of most of the armed conflicts of the past 50&nbsp;years.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="What could be more poetic than voting on a day that honors those who fought to keep our country safe?" author=""]There are those that don’t want to make Election Day a national holiday. The best argument I’ve heard is that it would drain GDP from the economy as yet another holiday from work. But Veterans Day is, of course, already a holiday. Those on the left should love it because it makes voting frictionless, those on the right should love it because there can be more scrutiny for fraud.

<p>I recently heard anecdotal stories of state hopping. Activists from “safe” states “moving” to purple states specifically for the purpose of swinging an election their partisan way. And by moving, I mean renting an apartment with multiple tenants that was rarely if ever used. It doesn’t sound fair to me. Is it a real problem with significant effects on an election? I don’t know, and we shouldn’t have to ask—there is a simpler solution.</p>

<p>I don’t understand, in an age where almost every person in the country does business with a State or Federal government—why there can’t be automatic voter registration, and a uniform federal standard for where you have to vote given a cutoff date before the election, say 30 days. If you move within the 30-day window you still vote in the previous State by absentee ballot. Or perhaps, you need a driver’s license or State ID transfer or other significant ties to the community to override the cutoff.</p>

<p>While I am very bothered by state hopping, I’m even more bothered by what I consider to be the four most important electoral reforms that, along with others to come, should find there way into a reasonably easy to pass omnibus electoral reform Constitutional Amendment. The first, to complete the registration discussion above is <a href="http://ivn.us/the-greater-platform/2013/04/30/is-the-right-to-a-fraud-free-counted-vote-a-greater-idea/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Right To A Fraud-Free Counted Vote</a>. The second is <a href="http://ivn.us/the-greater-platform/2013/05/07/will-banning-single-mark-ballots-make-greater-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banning Single Mark Ballots</a> that the duopoly fears most—as it would immediately empower many third parties. The third is <a href="http://ivn.us/the-greater-platform/2013/06/26/nationwide-fair-redistricting-would-end-gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nationwide Fair Redistricting</a> to ban gerrymandering safe districts for party bosses to have their way with. The fourth is <a href="http://ivn.us/the-greater-platform/2013/07/17/when-do-campaign-donations-become-bribes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">To End the Legal Extortion and Bribery of Elected Officials</a> with a doable transpartisan solution to campaign finance reform while maintaining free speech.</p>

<p>We’ll call Making Veterans Day Election Day the fifth most important because voting is—priceless. Having the day off to make sure there is no fraud, and there is frictionless access to an easy in-easy out voting booth is likewise—priceless. The federal government should assist any locality in the US that lacks the necessary resources to provide such a voting experience. C’mon, really, the US should be the gold standard of voting experiences in the world.</p>

<p>In an aGREATER.US poll of conservatives, liberals, and independents, where their opinions were given equal weight—a staggering 89% approved of Making Veterans Day our National Election Day.</p>

<p>What do you think about making Veterans Day Election Day?</p>
