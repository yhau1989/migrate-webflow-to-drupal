<p>Researchers at the Roskamp Institute in Florida recently published a study in the journal&nbsp;<em>Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience</em>&nbsp;revealing that <a href="http://thejointblog.com/new-study-cannabis-can-slow-cure-alzheimers-disease/#more-7683" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannabinoids could delay the effects of Alzheimer’s disease</a>, and could quite plausibly terminate&nbsp;the disease entirely.</p>

[advertisement title=""] Corbin Bachmeier, Ph.D, lead researcher of the study, declared that Alzheimer’s disease is “the result of impaired Aβ [Amyloid-β protein] clearance from the brain”. According to this particular study, cannabinoids can resolve this problem, which makes it a prospective treatment.

<p>Bachmeier’s examination determined that “modulation of the cannabinoid system was shown to reduce Aβ [Amyloid-β protein] brain levels and improve cognitive behavior in Alzheimer’s disease animal models.”</p>

<p>The study’s abstract states that the objective of the study was to “investigate the role of the cannabinoid system in the clearance of Aβ across the blood–brain barrier (BBB).”</p>

<p>For the first time in recorded history, the study in question establishes that the cannabinoid system does indeed play a role in the transit of Amyloid-β protein across the blood-brain barrier.</p>

<p>Bachmeier concluded that his discoveries “provide insight into the mechanism by which cannabinoid treatment reduces Aβ [Amyloid-β protein] burden in the AD [Alzheimer’s disease] brain and offer additional evidence on the utility of this pathway as a treatment for AD.”</p>

<p>This is good news for individuals suffering with this specific ailment and for their loved ones. Cannabinoids seem to be boundless in respect to the <a href="http://the420times.com/2013/07/study-marijuana-may-be-legitimate-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Study: Marijuana May Be Legitimate Treatment For Alzheimer’s Disease">medicinal benefits</a>&nbsp;they have to offer.</p>
