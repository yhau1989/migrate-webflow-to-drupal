<p>Most Americans will take the day off and jump into Summer fun on the Fourth of July. And some of us will spend some time reflecting on <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/02/why-we-should-celebrate-independence-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">what the day means</a>, or what our <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/03/presidential-debates-contradict-freedom-of-ideas-and-discussion/" rel="noopener noreferrer">democracy has become</a>. Some need to find better <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/07/03/5-interesting-ways-to-celebrate-july-4th/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ways to celebrate</a> the day.&nbsp;But let's run down some Independence Day facts to tie all our reflections together.</p>
<ul>
	<li><span>58 percent of Americans know which year the country declared its independence. 26 percent did not know, and 16 percent answered a different year.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>74 percent know which country the United States declared its independence from (spoiler alert: Great Britain). 20 percent did not know and 6 percent mentioned another country</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>About 74 million Americans will cook out on the Fourth. This will include 155 million hot dogs, 700 million pounds of chicken, and 68.3 million cases of beer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Although fireworks conclude the celebration of United States' roots and freedoms, $211 million worth of fireworks are imported from China. 22 tons of fireworks will be blasted into the New York City sky.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The colors mean more than simply "freedom." Red: hardiness and valor. White: hope, purity, and innocence. Blue: vigilance, perseverance, and justice.</li>
</ul>
