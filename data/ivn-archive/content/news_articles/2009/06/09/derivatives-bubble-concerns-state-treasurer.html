<p>On State Treasurer Robert Lauten’s <a href="http://www.lautenforcongress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> he displays the “<a href="http://www.actindependent.org/G20.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Washington DC - March 22, 2009">Act-Independent Statement</a>” to the G-20 Summit in London, APRIL 2, 2009.&nbsp; This insightful text intends to define the $1.5 Quadrillion derivates bubble, while making common sense recommendations for world leaders.&nbsp; Derivatives played a key role in the Orange County disaster during the Clinton years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the Orange County meltdown, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1994/b340434.arc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="December 19, 1994">Business Week</a> encouragingly noted in 1994:&nbsp; “The meltdown also could invite an era of far more intense regulation in both the municipal and derivatives markets--both of which, until now, have largely avoided Washington's gaze.”&nbsp; Today, it doesn’t appear anyone took that invitation.&nbsp; Although the very word “derivative” has become taboo, derivatives are quite simply “financial instruments based on other financial instruments – paper based on paper.”&nbsp; Today terms such as “toxic assets” and “complex securities” are more common.&nbsp; These include credit default swaps (prominent in the AIG fall), collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles and asset-backed securities.&nbsp; The solution?&nbsp; “Virtually all governments should be able to use their emergency economic powers to freeze derivatives...” Perhaps derivatives were illegal between 1936 and 1983 for a reason.&nbsp; This law was repealed by the Futures Trading Act of 1982. The Bush-Paulson-Obama-Geithner policy to bail out the world derivatives bubble ($10 trillion from the Fed and Treasury) is referred to as a zombie idea.&nbsp; “Derivatives pose the question of fictitious capital.”<br><br><br></p>
