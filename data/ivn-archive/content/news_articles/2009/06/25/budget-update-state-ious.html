<p>The Democrats failed to pass the first of 20 budget proposals yesterday (Wed 6/24).&nbsp; Not that it would have been too much better otherwise, as this proposal addressed only $11 of the $24 billion problem. Gov. Schwarzenegger’s proposal addressed $16 billion, but received scrutiny for cutting programs for the poor, including the now infamous “900,000 children” that will be without state-funded health insurance. Republicans are more or less with the Governor- other than releasing prisoners and borrowing from local governments- while the Democrats wish to reduce the cuts and increase “sin” taxes (such as alcohol, cigarettes- I suppose “oil” and “cars” are sins now too…).</p>
<p>Unless these differences are dealt with and we hit the “magic number of $24 billion” (as Senate Pro Tem Steinberg says, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN2423162220090624" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 24, 2009">Reuters</a>), <a href="http://www.sco.ca.gov/eo_news_registeredwarrants.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Government Website">IOU’s</a> may be issued July 2 for the first time since 1992 under Governor Pete Wilson, who issued warrants for the first time since the Great Depression.&nbsp; The 1992 act immediately drew lawsuits for violating the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and costs the state $558 million.&nbsp; Still, the act may be necessary, considering State Controller John Chaing said in a written statement that we will start the fiscal year next Wednesday “with a massively unbalanced spending plan and a cash shortfall not seen since the Great Depression.” He considers the warrants a very real possibility. If warrants (IOU’s) are issued, most state workers will not receive a “registered” warrant, which accumulates interest and is redeemable October 1, 2009, according to the <a href="http://www.sco.ca.gov/5935.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Government Website">State Controller’s website</a>), but rather they will receive a regular warrant.</p>
<p>Registered warrants will most likely be used for private businesses, paying back local governments and income tax returns.&nbsp; They will accrue interest at a rate not yet determined.&nbsp; “Regular” warrants are redeemable by the State Treasurer; therefore most financial institutions will accept them. “Unfortunately, the state’s inability to balance its checkbook will now mean short-changing taxpayers, local governments and small businesses,” Chaing says, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/us/25calif.html?hp" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="by Jennifer Steinhauler - June 24, 2009">NY Times</a>. There have been studies that suggest increased state spending and government expansion (see <a href="http://www.caivn.org/article/2009/06/11/failed-states-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="&quot;Failed States of America&quot;">previous post</a> for example) is the root of the problem, not merely the complex economic crisis- which should have been anything but unforeseen.&nbsp; Although the State and Assembly scheduled a meeting this morning (Thursday), it is unclear what they will accomplish (<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12688119" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="by Judy Lin, AP - June 25, 2009">Mercury News</a>). State credit is at risk, as Standard &amp; Poor’s warned that it may downgrade the California economic recovery sales tax bonds, given the problems the state is likely to face (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE55O07Q20090625  " rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 24, 2009">Reuters</a>).</p>
<p>If the Democrats pass their budget revisions with a simple majority vote it will take 90 days to go into effect, which may prove pointless considering the expenditures.&nbsp; “IOU’s are almost an admission of guilt that we can’t pay our bills,” said Chaing’s spokesman (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-budget25-2009jun25,0,1060005.story" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="by Goldmacher and McGreevy - June 25, 2009">LA Times</a>). “Almost?”&nbsp; Where’s the ambiguity? The legislature is ambiguous, however, according to Assemblyman Jim Nielsen, as he wonders how the people will have a clue as to what’s going on when they don’t- in reference to the inches-thick bill they received an hour before the debate.&nbsp; One bill “would allow the California Lottery and State Compensation Insurance Fund to invest in financial instruments the state issues to raise cash,” a mystery even to Assemblyman Nielsen, <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1975175.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="by Wiegand, Sanders &amp; Ferriss - June 25, 2009">Sac Bee</a> reports.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></p>
