<p>Arambula expresses disappointment over the state's water problem solutions and the Democratic leaders who curb the deficit by raising taxes without deeper cuts using "phantom money"                                   (<a href=" http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-arambula24-2009jun24,0,6182224.story" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 24, 2009">LA Times</a>). Although he recently received some new committee assignments by Speaker Karen Bass, Assemblymember Juan Arambula declined to state the actual reason for departing from the Democrat party to become independent, <a href=" http://www.contracostatimes.com/politics/ci_12671617?source=rss" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 23, 2009">Contra Costa Times</a> reports.&nbsp; He also "declined to state” his party affiliation, meaning that he is an independent voter, under California election laws (<a href=" http://fresnobeehive.com/opinion/2009/06/democratic_partyarambula_leave.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 23, 2009">Fresno Bee</a>).</p><p></p>
<p>He is not a Republican, however. Although he has voted for tax increases in the past, he admits that: “there is a time and place to do so.” He doesn’t deny doing so this time, saying: “The reality is that we are unlikely to get a two-thirds (vote) to raise taxes, so whether I might support them in limited situations or not is an academic issue” (<a href=" http://www.sacbee.com/politics/story/1971764.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 23, 2009">Sacramento Bee</a>). “Independent voters are the canaries in the coal mine of American politics,” the <a href=" http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124570175501838333.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 23, 2009">Wall Street Journal</a> reports, “They also tend to decide most elections.” The article goes on to suggest that Democrats are “renting” their voters and don’t “own” them, hence a reconcilement is not out of the question.</p>
