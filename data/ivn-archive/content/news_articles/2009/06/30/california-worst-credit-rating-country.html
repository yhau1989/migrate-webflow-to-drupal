<p>You gotta love the golden state.&nbsp; The land of opportunity, technology, and face lifts.&nbsp; It is a state that boasts all the natural resources one could need.&nbsp; It's got agriculture, energy, water, and beautiful women.&nbsp; It has a diverse population, an amazing coastline, beaches, ski resorts, and a governor that could beat up your entire family.&nbsp; But, they don't have money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp; Well the talking heads will tell you that California is a super liberal spendthrift group of government lovers.&nbsp; This may or may not be true.&nbsp; What is more factual is that California, hit by economic downturn can't afford to fund the rest of the country (being the largest "donor state" in the nation).&nbsp; It cannot live up to its promises fund every great idea that gets enough signatures to make the ballot, and it just cannot afford foot the bills any longer.</p>
<p>As FT.com reports,</p>
<p>"California is preparing to issue IOUs to its creditors this week as it <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b7139fa2-4c76-11de-a6c5-00144feabdc0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="A failing state">grapples with an unprecedented cash crunch</a> and prepares to begin its new fiscal year deep in the red.</p>
<p>Once the USâ€™s richest state, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23e9097a-5d32-11de-9d42-00144feabdc0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="California credit rating threat">California now has the dubious distinction of having the worst credit rating in the country</a>."</p>
