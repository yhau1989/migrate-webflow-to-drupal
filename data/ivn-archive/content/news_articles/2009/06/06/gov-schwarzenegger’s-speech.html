<p>The governor acknowledges “we are in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression,” and that in “the past 18 months one-third of the world's wealth has vanished...We are not Washington. We cannot print money. We cannot run up trillion-dollar deficits. We can only spend what we have."&nbsp; While reducing the budget for education, healthcare and prisons the governor assures that creative spending reductions will be implemented, such as “making textbooks available in digital formats.”&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-textbooks23-2009may23,0,5857054.story" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="May 23, 2009">LA Times</a>: “print textbooks already cost the state $400 million a year…” Read transcript of the governor’s speech courtesy <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/breaking/story/1912260.html?storylink=omni_popular" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="June 2, 2009">The Sacramento Bee</a>.<br><br></p>
