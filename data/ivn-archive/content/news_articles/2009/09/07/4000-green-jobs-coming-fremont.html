<p>As a result of a $500 million federal loan, Solyndra could hire up to 4,000 workers for its solar panel plant in Fremont. &nbsp;Governor Schwarzenegger is hailing the subsidy as a triumph for job creation, green energy, and Obama's stimulus package. &nbsp;However, the solar market faces multiple challenges. &nbsp;Start up costs for solar energy companies are extremely high, and loans are difficult to obtain due to a tight credit market. &nbsp;Demand for solar energy may also be insufficient to produce a thriving boom due to relatively low oil prices, at least in the near-term. &nbsp;Finally, Solyndra may find it difficult to compete once the federal subsidy expires.</p>
<p>Other issues come to mind as well. &nbsp;By granting Solyndra a massive subsidy, the Federal Government is denying assistance and investment capital to a host of other, struggling businesses in California. &nbsp;Is this fair? &nbsp;And what about Solyndra's competition? &nbsp;It will be forced to fund its own start up capital in order to compete in the energy market. &nbsp;Is this really fair?</p>
<p>And what about accountability? &nbsp;Do California and the Federal Government plan on implementing specific benchmarks to measure success along the way? &nbsp;Or, is this more of an open-ended commitment without strict oversight?</p>
