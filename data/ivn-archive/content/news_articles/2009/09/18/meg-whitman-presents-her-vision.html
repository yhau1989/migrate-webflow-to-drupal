<p>2010 gubernatorial candidate and former eBay CEO, Meg Whitman, discussed California's economic crisis in a recent <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1265817344&amp;play=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC interview</a> with Larry Kudlow. &nbsp;Whitman believes job creation, cutting government spending, and reforming the K-12 educational system will be the most vital objectives of the state's next governor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding cap &amp; trade legislation and offshore drilling, she expressed a willingness to take a closer look to see if a more ideal balance could be struck between environmental protection, business retention, and revenue generation. &nbsp;Whitman would also like to build up a rainy day fund for California, potentially review the tax code, utilize the line-item veto, and take advantage of the proposition system to enact policy changes.</p>
<p>When asked to differentiate herself from fellow Republican candidate, Steve Poizner, Whitman drew attention to her status as a political outsider and to her highly successful business career in the private sector.</p>
