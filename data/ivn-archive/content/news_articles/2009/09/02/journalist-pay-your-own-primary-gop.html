<p>Fox and Hounds journalist, Joe Matthews, made a number of thought-provoking <a href="http://foxandhoundsdaily.com/blog/joe-mathews/why-should-i-have-pay-for-your-primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">statements</a> regarding the California GOP's decision to prevent independent, non-partisan voters from participating in its state primary. &nbsp;For example, while he recognizes the GOP's perogative in restricting certain voters, he asks a very pointed question: &nbsp;why should we have to pay for your primary, then? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Matthews identifies independent voters as the fastest-growing segment of the electorate, yet these voters are forced to pay for a host of partisan primaries, many of which, they cannot even participate in. &nbsp;At a time when unemployment is sky high, the state is running massive deficits, and taxes are on the rise, a significant percentage of the voting bloc is being forced to fund partisan politics. &nbsp;As Matthews points out, one could argue that this constitutes "taxation without representation". &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Republican Party desires to shut out independent voters, Matthew argues, then it should pay for its own partisan primary. &nbsp;It should not place the financial responsibility on the taxpayers, especially when a significant portion of taxpayers isn't even able to participate in the political process. &nbsp;Ultimately, Matthew advocates non-partisan state elections as the most viable solution to this dilemma. &nbsp;After all, non-partisan elections already exist in cities and counties. &nbsp;That way, all voters, regardless of their party affiliation, would possess the right to vote as they please. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Matthews represents the growing voice of frustrated voters who are being ostracized by party regulars. &nbsp;California is mired in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. &nbsp;Partisan politics has failed the people in almost every way imaginable. &nbsp;Isn't it time for new voices, new ideas, and new solutions? &nbsp;A non-partisan primary initiative could go a long way toward instituting real change in a state whose "business as usual" approach to politics and economics has led to disaster.</p>
