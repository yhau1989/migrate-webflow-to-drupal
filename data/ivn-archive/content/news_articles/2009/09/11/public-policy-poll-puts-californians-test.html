<p>This is the 101st PPIC Statewide Survey in a series that has generated a database of over 216,000 Californians. &nbsp;Findings are based on a telephone survey of 2,006 California adult residents interviewed from August 26-September 2, 2009, on land lines and cell phones, in English or Spanish. &nbsp;The sampling error for all adults is +/- 2%.</p>
<p>Based on the comprehensive findings above, a few patterns emerge. &nbsp;On the state front, Californians are largely disappointed in their own government and concerned about the state's economic future. &nbsp;To correct these shortcomings, they seek qualified reform and greater transparency in certain political areas. On the federal front, Californians are much more positive in their views of the President, Congress, a public option for health care, and national security. &nbsp;And on both the state and federal levels, a majority of Californians advocates limits being placed on further spending increases.</p>
