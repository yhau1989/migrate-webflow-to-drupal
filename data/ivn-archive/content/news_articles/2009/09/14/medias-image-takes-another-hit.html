<p>According to a recent Pew Research Poll, more and more Americans are skeptical of media accuracy. &nbsp;The poll, which sampled about 1,500 adults on land lines and cell phones, revealed that 29% of Americans believe the news media provides accurate reports, while 63% believe news stories are often inaccurate. &nbsp;Even more revealing, only 26% of those polled believed that news organizations were careful to remove political bias from their reporting, while 60% said that news organizations are politically biased. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perceptions of California media accuracy and political bias are likely quite similar. &nbsp;As with the national media, most Californians would likely admit that California news reporting often limits or expands upon certain coverage based on the outlet's particular political bent. &nbsp;As a result, citizens will often limit themselves to the narrow perspective of a particular media outlet that already jives with their preconceived political leanings. &nbsp;It's consistent with human nature, of course, but as well-informed citizens, we need to constantly put our ideas, preconceived notions, and biases to the test. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where organizations like CAIVP come in. &nbsp;CAIVP represents a new type of media, one that incorporates nonpartisan reporting, critical thinking, and a diversity of political opinions. &nbsp;Voters are encouraged to think for themselves, instead of adopting the same old partisan talking points.</p>
<p>Americans are growing tired of politically charged, sensationalistic media reports. &nbsp;But, in order to resolve this dilemma, voters will have to turn their attention to more independent-minded news sources.</p>
