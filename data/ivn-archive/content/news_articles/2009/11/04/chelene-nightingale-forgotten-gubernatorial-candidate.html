<p>Meg Whitman isn't the only woman running for Governor. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nightingaleforgovernor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelene Nightingale</a> is also running for governor on the American Independent Party ticket, and she is proposing some novel solutions to help rescue California from the abyss. &nbsp;At this time, the media and political pundits view her as an irrelevant candidate, but keep in mind, the media has obsessed over the typical, high-profile candidates for years, and the state has become the laughingstock of the Union. &nbsp;Those looking to dig a bit deeper, evaluate alternative solutions, and think outside the box should take a closer look at Nightingale. &nbsp;Here are some of her proposed solutions to various issues:</p>
<p>Education-</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Increase choice by utilizing vouchers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Hold teachers to higher performance standards.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Create low cost nutritional options and school work programs for families in need.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Offer state support to homeschooling families.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Curtail educational benefits of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economy-</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Institute a freeze on all state hiring, pensions, salaries, taxes, and borrowing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Establish specific spending limits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Cut state programs by 5% annually for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Institute a part-time legislature.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Cut business taxes.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Reduce workers' comp costs and other extraneous benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Environment-</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Address population growth by enforcing immigration laws.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Explore privatizing the state's water supply and infrastructure.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Eliminate taxes and regulations on farmers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immigration-</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Secure the borders.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Enforce current immigration laws.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;End all state benefits to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Support the California Taxpayer Protection Act.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Enact E-Verify statewide.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Cut off state funding of sanctuary cities.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;End funding of in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>States rights-</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Demand state sovereignty under the 10th amendment of the U.S. Constitution and challenge federal law that burdens California with unconstitutional legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if one disagrees with some or all of Nightingale's positions, as a registered candidate, she should be able to compete alongside the Republican and Democratic candidates for the 2010 gubernatorial bid. &nbsp;California is in no position to hinder discourse or drown out alternative perspectives. &nbsp;Big money, big stars, establishment picks, and media favorites have failed the state time and time again. It's high time for fresh debate, new faces, and challenging dialogue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope a free and open-minded media walks the walk and offers Nightingale the opportunity to fully participate in the political debate.</p>
