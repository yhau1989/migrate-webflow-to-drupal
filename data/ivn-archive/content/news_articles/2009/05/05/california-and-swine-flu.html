<p>The
problem with a state of emergency is that it sounds so urgent.</p>

<p>So when
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-4106-California-Statehouse-Examiner%7Ey2009m4d30-Swine-Flu-in-California-a-state-of-emergency-though-still-mild-and-controlled" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared
a state of emergency</a> last Tuesday due to swine flu, it immediately bestowed the
outbreak a greater sense of urgency than it had at that point. Or has at this
point, for that matter - there still are only 14 confirmed cases in the state.</p>

<p><a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/12149/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The declaration</a> was a
strictly bureaucratic move - something the governor had to do to request
federal money and to allow better response coordination among county and state
agencies.</p>

<p>Yet some view "emergency" as synonymous to
panic.</p>

<p>Hospitals
in some parts of the state have seen 50 percent spikes in emergency room
visits. Patients have included one woman whose son took her in after she had a
hot flash - but no fever.</p>

<p>"I
am concerned about it," the son told <a href="http://www.modbee.com/local/story/686488.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Modesto Bee</i></a>. "I have a
5-year-old son in school. It is good to be cautious about it."</p>

<p>Cautious,
yes. Ridiculous, no.</p>

<p>"I
would say half the people we are seeing are afraid they have swine flu," a
doctor told The Bee. "They don't have the trio of symptoms -- fever,
respiratory illness and a connection to Mexico."</p>

<p>Talk
about mass hypochondria based on something that does, after all, happen on an
annual basis.</p>

<p>It's
called the flu. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-sci-swine-reality30-2009apr30,0,3606923.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some
experts think</a> the swine flu strain isn't nearly as virulent as what we see
in an average winter.</p>

<p>Yes, this
one is later than normal and, no, the vaccine distributed last fall won't fully
protect you from it. Not that the vaccine has ever <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-sci-swine-vaccine29-2009apr29,0,4276069.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully
protected patients</a> from all strains of the flu. The mix is based on the
previous flu season - viruses being what they are, they tend to mutate and
change over time, often making past patterns irrelevant.</p>

<p>Part of
the panic is a side effect to living in the information age, where news can fly
around the world far more quickly than the virus is spreading.</p>

<p>And when
the news breaks on a slow news day - as did the Centers for Disease Control
announcement Sunday of a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">national state of emergency</a> - it
tends to dominate coverage that day and on into the start of the work week.</p>

<p>The World
Health Organization's hyperbolic language isn't helping much either. Wednesday,
WHO changed swine flu's status to Phase 5, meaning officials believe an
international pandemic could be imminent.</p>

<p>"Influenza
pandemics must be taken seriously precisely because of their capacity to spread
rapidly to every country in the world," the WHO director general said <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_20090429/en/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">in
a news release</a>. "On the positive side, the world is better prepared
for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history." </p>

<p>It seems that people who have read "The
Stand," Stephen King's post-apocalyptic novel about a superflu that
decimated the world, a few too many times are missing the second part of that
statement.</p>

<p>The
official response - in California, the United State
and worldwide - is appropriate. </p>

<p>Thursday,
as one of her first official acts at health secretary, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/04/20090430a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathleen </a><a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/04/20090430a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebelius
announced</a> that the government would buy an additional 13 million flu
treatments, There already are 73 million stockpiled.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger,
though, already had made the most common sense move of all: Cover your mouth if
you cough or sneeze, wash your hands and stay home if you're sick, he advised.</p>

<p>Folks
must have missed those points in their rush to stockpile surgical masks.</p>
