<p>A funny thing happened on the  way to the budget compromise: numbers may have been just a little fudged.</p>
<p>New reports coming out point to extreme optimism and number crunching  errors in the computation of the California budget. After the state  faced serious repercussions of a more than $40 billion budget deficit,  state leaders reached a compromise at nearly the 11<sup>th</sup> hour,  to raise taxes and cut programs, in order to close the gap. As a result,  state officials are now looking towards something of a bailout, either  arriving from local hands or from the federal government.</p>
<p>Perhaps better coined a "state-out,"  the state appears to have two major options: one, to increase taxes  through a series of special election ballot initiatives which would  raise funds, by higher taxes and/or program cuts or being delaying or  deferring "scheduled payments to schools, local governments, service  providers, and others." The second option is to get additional money  from the federal government (stick situation). According to the California  Legislative Analyst's Office, the predicted shortfall of about $13  billion in short-term money is actually more of a shortfall of $20 billion.</p>
<p>An LAO update report was released  on May 7, titled "California's Cash Flow Crisis," the state's  shortfall of cash is blamed "in part because state revenue collections  have been weaker than expected," and pain is expected to be felt "in  the summer and fall of 2009." The LAO also encourages California leaders  to cut the fat and create a "short-term borrowing need" of less  than $10 billion for 2009-2010.</p>
<p>What is not being as widely  discussed is the last line of the report summary, which is as follows:  "We also note that the state should be cautious about accepting additional  federal assistance for the state's cash flow problems, especially given  the strings that may be attached to such aid."</p>
<p>The other option on the table  does include asking the federal government to basically back guarantees  from the state of California, which has not exactly received a warm  reception in Congress. It is fascinating, however, that the LAO would  so strongly caution against borrowing from Congress, particularly in  the wake of exactly what the LAO warns against: some federal stimulus  money has been threatened to be cut off in California, unless California  leaders enact certain concessions.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare's Hamlet,  Polonius advises his son "neither a borrower nor a lender be," to  protect against owing anyone too much. Methinks Master Shakespeare would  have made for a heck of a California representative, particularly today.</p>
