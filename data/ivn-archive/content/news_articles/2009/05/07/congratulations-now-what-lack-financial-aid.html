<p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to gain admittance to many California  colleges and universities. But for many students who earned the golden  ticket, a key question is arising: can they even afford to attend? <br> <br> Numerous higher education institutions, public and private, are lacking  the pool of aid they once had to provide to their admitted students.  Even student loans, including once better-bet, lower-interest rate federal  programs as <a href="http://www.staffordloan.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Stafford</span></a>, are numerous percentage points higher than  home equity lines of credit. Stafford, which allows students to borrow  a maximum of $25,000 per year, carries an interest rate of nearly 7  percent, whereas the <a href="http://www.parentplusloan.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Parent  Plus</span></a> is at 8.5 percent. <br> <br> In a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/education/01college.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>article</span></a>, the <em>New York Times</em> profiles a California  high school student who's been newly admitted to UC Berkeley. Yet like  many of his peers in the current economic climate, his family is in  tough financial straits:  his laid-off father continues to hunt for jobs,  while his mother brings home adequate wages from a teaching position. <br> <br> With a combined parental income of $58,000, one would think this student  would qualify for slightly more than the $218 in scholarship money he  received from the university. Maybe in the past, but now it appears  that schools' scarce resources are being spent on the most  needy students-- leaving the middle-class in a mad-dash to acquire funding. <br> <br> In spite of a 10 percent tuition increase system wide, and a 7 percent rise in tuition costs for the past few years, the 10-campus system  has come up short in the financial assistance it can provide to its  students. <br> <br> Some, such as the Berkeley student's younger sister, feel their so-called  safety net is to "gain admission to a wealthy, highly selective public  college hat, unlike the California system, might pay [their] tuition  in full." <br> <br> Yes, some universities such as Stanford--falling in line with many of  the East Coast Ivys--will grant full tuition to students with families  with incomes of less than $60,000. But other well-endowed, selective  California institutions are not quite as generous to its prospective  students. <br> <br> As a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/education/01college.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>story</span></a> points out, schools such as the private University  of Southern California are only granting full scholarships to the top  of the top applicants. With a $212,000 out-of-pocket cost for four years  of admission, even upper-middle class students are left in the dirt,  finding they can no longer borrow their way out of the situation. Free  Application for Federal Aid <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>(FAFSA)</span></a> applications increased by 20 percent--or 8.5  million more than the previous year. As students are receiving less  in loans--the upper-middle class USC admit the <em>LA Times</em> profiled  received a measly $5,000 a year--USC is seeing a 10 to 15 percent increase  in students requested financial aid, the article said. <br> <br> Is there a solution? Maybe for resourceful, and lucky, students who  successful track down both need and merit-based scholarships devoted  to sending them to college, or into the post-high school training they  desire. Popular scholarship search engines such as <a href="http://www.fastweb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Fastweb</span></a> are bound to see an increase in funding seekers.  <br> <br> Community colleges, which have a $20-a-unit cost, are by far the cheapest  way to go. Yet the students--especially <a href="/article/issues/2009/2/20/how-save-community-colleges-during-budget-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>in the midst</span></a> of $340 in deferred payments from the state  and a 10 percent increase in applications--face not getting the classes  they need to later transfer or even gain their Associates degree of  choice. <br> <br> The federal stimulus package carries provisions that fall in line with President  Obama's <a href="/article/issues/2009/2/20/how-save-community-colleges-during-budget-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>College  Affordability Plan</span></a>. The  American Opportunity Tax Credit will guarantee that the first $4,000  of college--about half the cost of in-state tuition for UC students--  is free for students. He also plans to eliminate the FAFSA, replacing  it with a form to predict financial need long before one pieces together  their college application, and increase the Pell Grant to $5,400 over  the next few years. <br> <br> Yet despite future plans, and a not-insignificant cost-reduction of  $4,000, most students entering college this year will be waging an uphill  battle. And, unlike in previous years, it will be less focused on passing  Physics, figuring out a major and balancing schoolwork and play than  getting to experience these things in the first place. <br> <br> <em>Rachel Stern, a graduate of UC Santa Cruz and a Bay Area-based freelance  writer, is currently trying to scrap together the funds to attend another  financial hurdle: graduate school. </em></p>
