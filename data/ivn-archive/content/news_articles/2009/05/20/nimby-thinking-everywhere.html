<p>It's all about NIMBY - Not In My 
Backyard - thinking in California.  Cut the budget, except for 
my sacred cow.  </p>
<p>The Sacramento Bee reports that a community 
group is pushing the City Council to rescind its 35 percent cut in the 
budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation that would - among 
other provisions - reduce lawn-mowing from once a week to once every 
three weeks and close bathrooms except for special events.</p>
<p>None of the cuts seem like particularly 
good ideas for the city, but neither does the $50 million deficit it 
is facing.   Yet the decision to cut maintenance costs at 
the parks has resulted in the marshaling of the Land Park Community 
Association's parks committee to fight the plan.</p>
<p>So the Parks people would prefer that 
the cuts be found in other areas.  Let's just say, for example, 
police and fire.  But then, the police and fire community associations 
will explain why such cuts will be disastrous.  On and on it goes, 
until the only possible cuts are those without a constituency to protect 
them.</p>
<p>On a statewide level, students and 
faculty are protesting tuition increases at the UC and CSU systems despite 
the fact that California's state universities are among the best bargains 
in the country.  The San Francisco Medical Society board of directors 
has voted to oppose propositions 1D and 1E, which would impact funding 
for children's services and mental health services, respectively.   
Board president Charles Wibbelsman told me San Francisco Chronicle, 
"It is sad that when financial constraints become severe the most 
vulnerable are often the first to be targeted, and we oppose that -- 
especially when the programs in question have been working well,"</p>
<p>And a 10 percent proposed cut in Medi-Cal 
is opposed by the California Association of Medical Product Suppliers, 
whose "talking points" package ends with this directive to their 
members: "LET THEM KNOW YOU ARE A SMALL BUSINESS CONSTITUENT THAT 
DIDN'T CAUSE THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS."  </p>
<p>Every one of the individual concerns 
by interest groups are logical and, to one degree or another, compelling.  
But California is attempting to meet a real-world budget crisis, which 
may cause us to default on our debts and create even more pain for the 
state and its citizens.  Someone has to prioritize the cuts despite 
the NIMBY factor involved.   The alternative is massive cuts to 
the few programs that have no friends to protect them.</p>
<p>Prioritizing cost reductions and revenue 
increases is a necessity in the current economy, and while citizen protests 
are a cherished tradition, we all need to take some of our NIMBY thinking 
off the table.   </p>
