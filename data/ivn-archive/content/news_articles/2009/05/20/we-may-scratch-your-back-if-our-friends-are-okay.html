<p>Some pretty embarrassing chatter 
has come to light in recent days, better illuminating the new relationship 
between the state of California and the new federal leadership. This 
month, it was alleged that the Obama administration threatened to withhold 
nearly $7 billion in federal funding, that otherwise was supposed to 
go to California as part of the federal stimulus program, to help pay 
for medical costs attached to Medicaid.</p>
<p>As is stands, the state had 
faced a project budget deficit of $42 billion at the bleakest point, 
in February, before a tentative budget balancing deal was agreed upon. 
Now, the projected cash shortfall has risen to over $20 billion. While 
that is going on, the Service Employees International Union, is apparently 
griping over $2 per hour.</p>
<p>The murky situation appears 
to hinge on two factors: first, legislators in the state of California 
proposed cutting $74 million from home health care workers' maximum 
salaries (per hour) as part of a complex plan to balance the budget; 
secondly, that at some point, the union serving those employees, the 
Service Employees International Union, is accused of putting pressure 
on the federal government to withhold certain federal funding dollars 
(ostensibly to the tune of $6.8 billion) until the salary caps were 
removed. The alleged phone call between White House officials, California 
officials and SEIU officials, is said to have taken place on April 15. 
Flash forward more than a month later, and whether or not the state 
will receive those federal dollars... is still unknown.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Los Angeles 
Times</i>, signals have been mixed, at best, from the president's staff. 
The <i>LA Times</i> writes that "state officials said they had explicitly 
been told. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration said they were 
notified by senior Obama staff on May 3 that California's plan to cut 
wages for unionized home healthcare workers violated the law that authorized 
the stimulus package."</p>
<p>It gets even murkier. SEIU 
officials are not even trying to hide their interconnectedness with 
the big guy. In a May interview in the Las Vegas Sun, the president 
of the SEIU, Andy Stern, stated that his union pumped more than $60 
million into the effort to back Barack Obama's bid for the presidency. 
If this doesn't create confusion, or a clear conflict of interest, 
then nothing will.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Wall Street 
Journal,</i> officials in California had "agreed to... wage cuts for unionized 
home health-care workers. The Service Employees International Union 
huffed to the higher power in Washington, which duly agreed to hold 
California's stimulus hostage. Governor Schwarzenegger has sent a 
letter asking the feds to reconsider."</p>
<p>Bottom line: the state of California 
is in a fiscal mess, and every dollar counts. With the expected rejection 
of the six May 19 ballot initiatives (some to "save" money by shuffling 
around funds, one to raise taxes), voters in the Golden State are making 
it clear that wasteful and ineffective governing is unacceptable. Having 
a powerful union stepping in and dictating how millions of taxpayer 
dollars should be spent (to help their employees, and damn the fate 
of the rest of taxpayers) and whether or not federal dollars should 
reach California, should be just as disgust-inciting, as any other irresponsible 
move meant to adversely affect state residents.</p>
<p>Blocking $6.8 billion, and 
all over $2.00 less per hour, per employee... it makes you think. Perhaps 
the SEIU should offer to pay any state workers who lose their jobs as 
a result of the funding freeze, as the SEIU appears to believe the difference 
between a little over $12 per hour and a little over $10 per hour, is 
so vital, particularly in this economy.</p>
