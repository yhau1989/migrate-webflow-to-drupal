  As befits a man who has been in some form of
California government service for the past 30 years, a poll released
Monday evening shows that Lt. Gov. <a href="http://www.garamendi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="John Garamendi">John Garamendi</a> would soundly beat virtually all opponents vying to replace U.S. Rep. <a href="http://www.tauscher.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Ellen Tauscher">Ellen Tauscher</a> in the 10th Congressional District if the election was held immediately.</p><p>Conducted May 1-4 by Sacramento pollster Jim
Moore of J. Moore Methods Inc., the survey concentrated on the major
likely candidates in the race to replace Tauscher who has been
appointed Undersecretary of State in the Obama Administration. It
quizzed voters on their opinions of Garamendi, state Sen. <a href="http://www.markdesaulnier.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mark DeSaulnier">Mark DeSaulnier</a> (D-Concord) and Assemblywoman <a href="http://www.joanbuchanan.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Joan Buchanan">Joan Buchanan</a> (D-Alamo). Moore also asked voters about the possible leading Republican candidate for the race, Contra Costa County Sheriff <a href="http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/index.asp?nid=60" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Warren Rupf">Warren Rupf</a>.</p><p>If the election were held presently, the poll shows that Garamendi
would walk away with 24 percent of the vote. His closest competitor,
DeSaulnier, would bring in 13 percent and Buchanan would collect 10
percent. Ruph would garner 17 percent of the vote, Moore reported.<br>


  <br>


  Since Tauscher must still be first confirmed by
the U.S. Senate before she can take office, the actual date of the
election to replace her has not been determined.</p><p>The poll also shows the lieutenant governor owning a commanding lead when it comes to "favorability" ratings amongst voters:


  </p><p>--Garamendi: 80 percent favorable; 12 percent unfavorable.


  </p><p>--DeSaulnier: 16 percent favorable; 13 percent unfavorable.


  </p><p>--Buchanan: 17 percent favorable; 12 percent unfavorable.


  </p><p>--Ruph: 9 percent favorable; 9 percent unfavorable..<br>


  <br>


  "I have served the people of the 10<sup>th</sup> Congressional
District in one form or another for decades," Garamendi said in a
prepared statement. "This poll reflects my decades of public service
fighting for issues that matter to voters in Contra Costa, Solano,
Alameda, and Sacramento counties."<br>


  <br>


  The poll did not measure voter responses to two other Democrats in the race, <a href="http://www.anthonywoodsforcongress.com/home.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Anthony Woods">Anthony Woods</a> of Fairfield and <a href="http://adriel4congress.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Adriel Hampton">Adriel Hampton</a> of Dublin. Likewise Moore did not inquire about voter opinions on possible Republican candidates <a href="http://www.gogerber.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Nick Gerber">Nick Gerber</a> of Moraga, <a href="http://www.politicalvanguard.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Tom Del Beccaro">Tom Del Beccaro</a> of Lafayette, Catherine Moy of Fairfield and David Harmer of Dougherty Valley.</p><p>Moore said the poll contacted 400 likely voters in the district and carried a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.</p><p><i>Follow Jeff Mitchell's political journalism at <a href="http://www.bapolitix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="BAPolitix.org">BAPolitix.org</a></i>
