<p>Approximately 1,500 fewer high 
school seniors will become freshman at University of California campuses than last year this fall.</p><p>Fewer students were admitted for Fall 2009 to the UC campuses, 
mainly owing to a budget crunch and fewer allotted spaces. While more 
than 60,000 students became first-time UC freshmen last year, fewer 
than 60,000 have earned that distinction for next fall. </p><p>Months ago, 
when budget issues throughout California came to a head, UC officials announced that fewer first-time college students 
would be admitted to a UC campus for the next 
year. </p><p> The UC state-granted 
funding fell short by about $450 million this year, though in an April 
20 announcement that federal stimulus dollars will go towards UC campuses, 
the UC Office of the President notes that an additional $268 million 
in federal money will help bring down the UC shortfall by $13 million, 
to about $437 million.</p>
<p>Approximately three-quarters 
(72%) of all UC applicants were secured spaces for next fall at one 
or more UC campuses, according to the University 
of California newsroom, which marks a drop of about 3.4% from Fall 2008 
admission rates. 66,265 applicants were admitted for next fall, 58,631 
of which were residents of California. This year marked the most competitive 
for many campuses, including traditionally less competitive UC campuses, 
such as UC Santa Cruz (which ended up accepting 63.7% of applicant, 
or nearly 11% fewer applicants than the previous year) and UC Davis 
(which accepted 42.6% of applicants, compared to 52.4% last year), though 
the latter has become increasingly more competitive in recent years. 
</p><p>A number of campuses, such UCLA and UC Berkeley (two of the oldest UC 
campuses) and UC Merced actually admitted approximately the same, or 
even slightly more, applicants than usual. Berkeley admitted 29.5 percent 
of applicants. Some Berkeley students were recently in the news for 
allegations that minorities were being shafted by tighter admissions, 
though that claim was refuted by recent data, showing that of "underrepresented 
students," African Americans, American Indians and Chicanos/Latinos 
actually increased their presence on campuses, from 22.9% in 2007, to 
26.9% this year, showing that "despite the reductions in admissions 
offers...which affected all groups... most campuses registered gains 
in the proportion of underrepresented students in their admitted class."</p>
<p>Nearly half of the UC budget 
for 2007-2008 (42%) was provided by "Sales, Services and Auxiliaries," 
according to the University of California Office of the President.</p>
