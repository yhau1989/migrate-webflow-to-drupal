<p>The California Car Buyers' Protection Act of 2009, appears to protect 
car buyers; however, it may, by extension, end up hurting car buyers. 
By presenting greater leeway to punish auto sellers, if fewer auto dealers 
are willing to sell cars in California and become more risk-averse, 
buyers may be adversely affected, as well.</p>
<p>The bill would "make it unlawful for a 
dealer who purchases a used vehicle with a balance due to a secured 
party to fail to pay off the entire balance prior to transferring or 
selling the vehicle and would increase he amount of a dealer's bond 
from $50,000 to $100,000." </p><p>Primarily, the bill seeks to ensure that 
car dealers are not unduly selling cars with hidden debts, and seeks 
to protect those deemed most at-risk when trading in and selling cars. 
However, if a car buyer can prove (or at least claim) that they were 
"deceived" by a car seller, this bill may provide steadier ground 
for buyers to bring action "against the dealer, his or her salesperson, 
and the surety upon the dealer's bond for actual damages plus any 
incidental and consequential damages."</p>
<p>The impetus for the bill is 
explained as such: "During the past year at least 480 new and used 
licensed auto dealerships have gone out of business in California, far 
more than in any other state, and it is project that the numbers will 
continue to accelerate for the foreseeable future," and while "the 
current federal assistance fails to provide any relief for car buyers, 
while providing taxpayer dollars to assist the auto manufacturers, dealers, 
and workers who are seeking assistance from the American public... it 
is ultimately car buyers who will determine the fate of our domestic 
auto industry by buying cars." </p><p>A number of high profile California 
agencies, including the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association 
and Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, have expressed optimism 
and support for the bill.</p><p><br>
