<p>Calling them a "rotten deal," the <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Green Party of California">Green Party of California</a> announced last week that it would formally oppose Props. 1A through 1F on the May 19 special election ballot.</p>
<p>"We oppose the cuts in transportation, education, social services and other humane services, and we oppose this deal even though we were told that great hardship would result if (this) rotten deal failed to pass," said Michael Rubin, who analyzed the measures for the Green Party of Alameda County.</p>
<p>"Even more we oppose the process which offers us a 'choice' of being shot in the leg or shot in the arm, but did not offer us the choice of using our collective wealth to meet human needs."</p>
<p>Party officials say the announcement comes after polling its individual members as well as its county councils during April.</p>
<p>Rubin added:</p>
<p>...Some Greens polled believed that Prop. 1B looked good at first glance, they discarded it because it was only the "sweetener" for the rotten deal, especially Prop.1A. They rejected Prop. 1C for much the same reasons. Prop. 1D and Prop. 1E were turned down because they steal money from two previous propositions meant to benefit children and families, as well as from mental services. Finally, Greens voted to oppose Prop.1F because it is deceptive, and doesn't really prevent the politicians from receiving their normal salaries, per diem and other perks (like free use of automobiles, etc.). It only bars "increases" in budget deficit years.</p>
<p>The party's announcement -- especially in regards to opposing the key Prop. 1A -- echoes similar action taken by many of the state's grassroots progressive activists and bloggers as well as such groups as the <a href="http://www.calnurses.org/legislative_advocacy/cnannoc-voter-guide-for.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="California Nurses Association">California Nurses Association</a> union and the <a href="http://ca.lwv.org/action/prop0905/flyer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="California League of Women Voters">California League of Women Voters</a> .</p>
