<p>There is no clearer statement of the 
direction of any organization than its budget.  Given the opportunity 
to impact the direction for all of California through this month's 
budget-related ballot initiatives, the state's voters are likely to 
say "no thanks" in mass quantities by not showing up at the polls.  
There are perfectly logical reasons why the numbers are predicted to 
be so low:  the issues are complex and hard to understand; there 
are no personalities in the form of candidates to inspire allegiance; 
and there is a general belief that whatever we do won't make a difference 
because the state is in such a mess.</p>
<p>So what?  The Declaration of Independence 
says, "...to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among 
Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...."  
The vote is our mechanism of consent.  Not using it is a blow against 
democratic government and a weakening of individual rights.</p>
<p>Worse still, a non-vote cedes power 
to others by multiplying their impact.  If I vote when only 40 
percent of eligible voters choose to exercise their franchise, my vote 
is 67 percent more powerful than if 60 percent of eligible voters go 
to the polls.</p>
<p>Today, nearly 50 percent of eligible 
voters do not exercise their right to voice their views through the 
ballot (this is a national statistic based on all elections - not 
just ballot measures).  What is even more stunning is that the 
percent of voters drops precipitously with age.  Our youngest voters 
(18-24) have ceded control of their nation to older voters by registering 
only 30 percent of voting age population and voting at an abysmal 16 
percent rate.  Even among the oldest measured age group (55-64), 
voters represent only 60 percent of the eligible population.  Now 
imagine a future with 95 percent of our citizens voting.  Engagement 
in our own governance will increase, as will knowledge of the issues 
and the individuals who are running.  The fervor for democracy 
will grow, and we will again be a beacon of freedom to the entire world.</p>
<p>Voting in our state and nation is safe, 
secret and simple - something which cannot be said for parts of the 
world where a large percentage of eligible voters turn out.  Voting 
irregularities are rare and are quickly brought to light.  If you 
object to the time and trouble of actually going to the polls, you can 
have the state deliver an absentee ballot to your doorstep and return 
it to the voting agency at no charge.</p>
<p>Our typical voting results are diverse 
- it is rare when a measure wins or loses by an overwhelming margin.  
A six or seven percentage point difference is a big win, and the electorate 
is often evenly divided on candidates and issues.  That makes your 
vote even more crucial.</p>
<p>Our political process is often messy 
and tumultuous, filled with marketing slogans and often irrational posturing 
by individuals.  But that's just a sign that the process is vibrant 
and organic - uncontrolled by the state or powerful individuals.  
You are in charge.</p><p>
Unless, that is, you choose to stay 
out of the voting process.  Why would a free man or woman avoid 
the opportunity to choose for themselves?  It's a mystery to 
me.  I'm voting.  How about you?</p><p> </p>
