<p>A day after an angry and frustrated California
electorate trounced five of six measures on a special election ballot,
an influential Bay Area business group announced their intention to
restructure state government by holding a rare constitutional
convention.
</p>

<p>Dubbed "<a href="http://www.repaircalifornia.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Repair California">Repair California</a>," the campaign is being led by the <a href="http://www.bayareacouncil.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Bay Area Council">Bay Area Council</a>, a San Francisco-based business and public policy advocacy organization.
</p>

<p>During a press conference held Wednesday in Sacramento, the group called for the California Legislature to place
a measure on the November 2010 ballot which would ask voters to provide
themselves the allowance of amending the state constitution directly,
bypassing the legislature. Repair California officials also want
lawmakers to place a companion measure on the same ballot asking voters
to authorize a future date for such a convention and to approve what
issues convention delegates should debate. 
</p>

<p>Voters at a later election would then be required to approve any changes to the constitution proposed by the delegates. If
the legislature does not place the measures on the ballot, the Repair
California campaign will use the initiative process to do so, officials
with the organization said.
</p>

<p>Jim Wunderman, Bay Area Council's president and
chief executive officer, said the campaign is well past due and has
been carefully considered and vetted from a number of leading
California groups.
</p>

<p>"We
do not make this move lightly," Wunderman said in a prepared statement.
"We have spent a great deal of time weighing the pros and cons of this
idea, and after meeting with hundreds of groups and citizens across the
state, we know the people are with us.  Enough is enough.  The severity
of our problems and the unlikelihood that existing Sacramento
structures can provide a solution mean now is the time for decisive
action."  
</p>

<p>According to the campaign's web site, Repair California wants to make these changes to the constitution:
</p>

<p>--Governance,
including the structure of the legislative and executive branches of
government, with the latter to include State agencies and commissions.</p><p>
--Elections, including the initiative and referenda processes, campaign finance, and term limits.</p><p>--The Budget, including the budget process and related
requirements, such as the two-thirds legislative vote required to pass
a budget, the term and balancing of a budget, and mandated spending.</p><p>--Revenue distribution, including the revenue relationship between local and state government

  <br>


  Joining Bay Area Council officials Wednesday in supporting the Repair California campaign was the progressive netroots <a href="http://www.couragecampaign.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Courage Campaign">Courage Campaign</a>, the Western States unit of <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4741359" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Common Cause">Common Cause</a> and the conservative <a href="http://www.lincolnclub.org/mc/page.do" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Lincoln Club of Orange County">Lincoln Club of Orange County</a> among others.</p><p>"A
Constitutional Convention returns power to the people as was originally
intended," said Rick Jacobs, founder and chair of the 700,000 member
Courage Campaign.  "The Special Election is the latest example of the
Governor and the Legislature turning to the voters to make their
decisions.  A constitutional convention just 'cuts out the middleman'
and give voters the power to make California governable."<br>
  
  
    
      <br>
    
    
      Repair
California's web site suggests that an actual constitutional convention
would involve about 120 delegates, could last for several weeks  months
and could cost state tax payers as much as $23 million -- the amount
the state of Illinois paid when it held its constitutional convention
last year.
