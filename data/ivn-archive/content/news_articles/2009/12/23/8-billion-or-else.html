<p>Governor Schwarzenegger is demanding <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-budget23-2009dec23,0,7164018.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">$8 billion</a> in federal aid, or else he promises to enact massive cuts to a $21 billion budget deficit. Both Schwarzenegger and Senate President Pro Tem, Darrell Steinberg, are lobbying the Federal Government for billions to plug yet another monolithic state budget gap. &nbsp;The Governor is warning, that absent any significant federal aid, he may be forced to severely cut CalWORKS (the state's primary welfare program), In-Home Healthcare Services, and two large tax breaks for big corporations. &nbsp;He will also propose an extension to state worker furloughs, amounting to a 14% pay cut, as well as obtaining revenue from an offshore oil drilling platform off the coast of Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Facing another round of crushing deficits, the Governor and state Legislature will likely adopt a number of desperate financial measures to stop the bleeding. &nbsp;Excessive borrowing and spending, and subpar tax revenue due to high unemployment and a small business collapse have left the golden state with a projected $83 billion shortfall over the next four years.</p>
<p>Couple a severe deficit with an election year, and 2010 may prove to be a very tumultuous year for Californians. &nbsp;The continued economic misery serves as clear cut evidence for the urgent necessity of novel ideas, fresh solutions, and brand new perspectives in Sacramento.</p>
