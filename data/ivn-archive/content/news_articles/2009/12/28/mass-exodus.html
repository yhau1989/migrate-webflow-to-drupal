<p>Individuals and businesses continue to flee the golden state. &nbsp;Last year, California lost another <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/108478/biggest-losers-where-americans-are-not-moving" rel="noopener noreferrer">98,000</a> residents, continuing a trend long in the making over the last decade. &nbsp;Even despite a housing crash and 10% nationwide unemployment, Californians are still leaving in droves. Many would argue that excessive regulation, high taxes, and a high cost of living are key drivers for the mass exodus that is severely damaging the state's business infrastructure, intellectual synergy, and revenue stream. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If this disturbing trend is not reversed, California will continue to languish in an economic malaise. &nbsp;While mainstream candidates and both major parties have offered impressive sounding rhetoric over the last ten years, they have been unable to stem the tide. &nbsp;Their policies and proposed solutions have failed to reverse the debilitating trend.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's time for a whole new approach to solve the golden state's mass exodus problem. &nbsp;Whether it's a rising class of more independent-minded candidates within the Republican and Democratic Parties, or an entirely new movement of independent-minded candidates working outside the "Two-headed, One-party monster", it is going to require a revolution of sorts to develop an entirely new strategy. &nbsp;Independent voters are encouraged to take a more critical look at the mainstream candidates, media favorites, and party machines as they head to the polls next year. &nbsp;</p>
