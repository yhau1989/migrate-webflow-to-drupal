<p>As California's economy continues to languish, China is becoming an economic powerhouse. &nbsp;According to official government estimates, China has likely overtaken Japan as the world's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/6890189/Chinese-economy-overtakes-Japan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">second</a> largest economy. &nbsp;Just four years ago, China's economy passed Great Britain to become the world's fifth largest economy. &nbsp;Meanwhile, California has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16600877/" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped</a> to the world's eighth largest economy, and after this year's economic statistics are fully vetted, it could drop even lower.</p>
<p>China's ascendance should put California and the United States on notice. &nbsp;While California and the United States (still the world's largest economy) are trending downward, China is rapidly rising on the world stage. &nbsp;Impressive growth rates, large-scale government stimulus packages derived from savings instead of debt, public works development, and a modernizing productive capacity are making China more and more competitive. &nbsp;Just last week, China unveiled the world's fastest <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2009/12/28/china-unveils-the-worlds-fastest-high-speed-train/" rel="noopener noreferrer">train</a>, which now links several of its more undeveloped regions to booming urban centers where industry and service reign. &nbsp;It expects to add forty-two more high-speed rail lines by 2012. &nbsp;In addition, China owns approximately $1 trillion of our national debt, and has been highly critical of the Fed's dollar devaluation policies and massive government spending packages (money derived from borrowing, not savings).</p>
<p>California, on the other hand, continues to lose its competitive edge in the global economy. &nbsp;Massive debt, high unemployment, hostile business conditions, and a <a href="http://caivn.org/article/2009/12/11/export-economy-trying-claw-its-way-back" rel="noopener noreferrer">decimated</a> export industry have pummeled the golden state. &nbsp;Like America at large, California's consumer sector has replaced manufacturing and production as its leading economic engine. &nbsp;Unless California and the United States rebalance their economies with a more production based and savings oriented approach, they will continue to deteriorate, weighed down by big deficits, huge debt, a weak Dollar, high unemployment, and subpar growth.</p>
<p>There are some, however, that believe China could be following the same trajectory as Japan in the 1980s and the United States in the 2000s. &nbsp;Artificially low interest rates, government spending sprees, and huge bubbles in the credit, real estate, and stock markets propelled Japan and the US to temporary record highs before spectacular collapses. &nbsp;Some economists are warning of a similar fate for China. &nbsp;If the more bearish scenario plays out, California and the United States could gain a much needed reprieve from China's dizzying rise to economic prominence. &nbsp;But, if China is able to avoid its own bubble, then California will likely be left in the dust and in five years, the US may find itself face to face with a legitimate superpower that owns more than $1 trillion of its debt.</p>
<p>Urgent action is needed to avoid the latter scenario. &nbsp;Radical, new ideas, unorthodox solutions, and a slew of fresh faces are desperately needed to reshape California and the United States. &nbsp;The golden state, as well as the entire nation, need a brand new vision to replace the stale policies of the past. &nbsp;Hopefully, in 2010 and 2012, voters will begin instituting this new vision to rescue California and America from the economic abyss.</p>
