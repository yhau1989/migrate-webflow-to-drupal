<p>According to Wolfgang Knorr, of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol, the fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide has not increased in the last 160 years. &nbsp;His <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091230184221.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">findings</a>, published in the <span>Geophysical Research Letters</span>, appear to contradict the climate consensus on CO2 emission levels, often viewed as the main culprit for anthropogenic global warming. &nbsp;Knorr posits that only about 45% of emitted carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere, while oceans and terrestrial ecosystems absorb the majority of emissions.</p>
<p>While more research is needed, this latest study reveals why Independents remain split over the scientific validity of anthropogenic global warming. &nbsp;For some in the scientific community, and many political independents on Main St, the theory requires further investigation, analysis, and testing as contradictory data continues to challenge the consensus position.</p>
