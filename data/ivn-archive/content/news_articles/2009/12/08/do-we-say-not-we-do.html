<p>Independent voters crave credibility in the political arena. &nbsp;But, alas, credibility is hard to find these days. &nbsp;Whether it's Republicans mocking Democrats for excessive federal spending, after adding $5 trillion of debt themselves, or Democrats castigating Republicans for an overly hawkish foreign policy, then repeatedly voting to continue funding in Iraq and massively escalating the war in Afghanistan, or Tea Party enthusiasts scolding President Obama, when they were nowhere to be found during the Bush debacles, independents recognize grandiose hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Now, hypocrisy is rearing its ugly head at the global climate summit at Copenhagen, Denmark. &nbsp;Thousands of leaders, celebrities, special interests, and journalists are descending to participate in climate change discussion which could establish a whole new set of laws to curb greenhouse emissions. &nbsp;Preaching green energy, conservation, and austere CO2 restrictions, the conference is projected to expend about <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/copenhagen-climate-change-confe/6736517/Copenhagen-climate-summit-1200-limos-140-private-planes-and-caviar-wedges.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">41,000 tons</a> of "carbon dioxide equivalent", an amount that rivals the CO2 production of a mid-sized city. &nbsp;Hundreds of private jets, approximately 1200 limos, and large, gas guzzling motorcades will ferry the environmentalist advocates in and out of Denmark. &nbsp;Few hybrid vehicles will be in service, as Denmark exacts a high tax on such energy saving transportation.</p>
<p>But, is this really any surprise? &nbsp;We're all aware of how much energy the Gore mansion was burning through in years past as he warned of an imminent, global warming apocalypse. &nbsp;Is it any wonder, then, that global warming skeptics view the climate change movement with a fair amount of suspicion? &nbsp;The recent Climategate scandal has raised doubts about the scientific validity of the model, and the hypocritical nature of the CO2 burning Copenhagen conference makes one wonder if even environmental advocates take the threat all that seriously. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As they say, actions speak louder than words.</p>
