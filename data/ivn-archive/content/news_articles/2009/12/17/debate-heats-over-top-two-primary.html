<p>A new poll and multiple op-eds are placing the 2010 Top Two Open Primary ballot initiative in the spotlight. &nbsp;The latest Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) <a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/pressrelease.asp?i=993" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> revealed that 47% of likely voters consider the Top Two Primary to be a very important issue on next year's ballot, outpacing marijuana legalization at 38%, a Constitutional Convention at 35%, and public funding for statewide elections at 32%. &nbsp;The Top Two narrowly trailed gay marriage (51%) and finished third to lowering the legislative requirement to pass a budget (54%). As the 2010 elections fast approach, expect the Top Two Primary to play a pivotal role in the political polls.</p>
<p>Also, the Top Two Open Primary is receiving considerable attention in several media outlets. &nbsp;Thomas Elias wrote a strong endorsement in the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/peninsula/ci_14005925" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Jose Mercury News</a>, while Steven Greenhut and Richard Winger wrote potent rebuttals in the <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/party-224030-top-election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC Register</a> and <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=9536&amp;catid=4&amp;volume_id=452&amp;issue_id=463&amp;volume_num=44&amp;issue_num=11" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco Bay Guardian</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>In defense of the ballot initiative, Elias offered the following points:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;More moderate centrists will be elected</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Good public policy will trump partisan ideology</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;It will give a voice to millions of voters</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;It will serve as the first step toward a better, faster, and surer government, even more so than a Constitutional Convention</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;If party ideologues despise the measure, then it must contain some merit</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Candidates would have to court voters across the political spectrum</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;With California crippled by paralytic dysfunction, voters should consider the initiative a top priority</p>
<p>In opposition to the ballot initiative, Greenhut and Winger offered the following points:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Initiative supporters seek candidates who think as they do</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Moderates have not solved California's problems</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;It would not address the state's core fiscal issues</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;It would eliminate third parties from the general election</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Incumbents, as in Louisiana and Washington, would retain a high re-election rate</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;It would eliminate write-ins</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;It would hamper debate and reduce voter choice</p>
<p>As next year's elections draw near, independent-minded voters are encouraged to carefully study both perspectives and draw their own conclusions. &nbsp;California is in desperate need of authentic, political and fiscal reform, and independents will play a crucial role in reshaping the golden state as the fastest growing segment of the electorate.</p>
