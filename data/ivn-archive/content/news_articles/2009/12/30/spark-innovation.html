<p>Although California languishes near the bottom of the nation in educational performance, rays of hope are emerging. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-davinci29-2009dec29,0,5757910.story?page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two</a>, new charter schools, <a href="http://davincischools.org/davinciscience.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Da Vinci Science High School</a> and <a href="http://davincischools.org/davinciscience.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Da Vinci Design School</a>, have launched innovative curriculums focusing on science, engineering, computers, and practical application in the humanities. &nbsp;Students build model roller coasters, design elaborate projects, and write their own children's books. &nbsp;Together, the two new, public charter schools contain 448 students. &nbsp;At this time, the Design School only offers 9th grade and the Science School offers 9th and 10th grades, but each school plans to expand a grade each year. &nbsp;Premier corporations, such as Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Chevron, Boeing, and Belkin have already donated significant sums of money to the upstart schools.</p>
<p>If California is to ever regain its competitive advantage in the educational arena, charter schools like Da Vinci will serve as a potent catalyst. &nbsp;At these schools, education comes alive, and rote knowledge is transferred to practical application in the real world. &nbsp;Students learn to work in teams, hone project management skills, and develop innovative technologies. &nbsp;Teachers demand excellence, and students perform up to expectations.</p>
<p>If California wants to begin competing with the likes of China, India, Brazil, and Japan, it will need to adopt novel strategies to rebuild its sagging scholastic foundation. &nbsp;Schools must develop innovative, robust, and practical curriculums in science, technology, and the humanities. &nbsp;Competition amongst the various public schools, public charter schools, private schools, and homeschool co-ops must be encouraged in order to establish choice, opportunity, and top performance.</p>
<p>The time has come for a whole new model in California education.</p>
