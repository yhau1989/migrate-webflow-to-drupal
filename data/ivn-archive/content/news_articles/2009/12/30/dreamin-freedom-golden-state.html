<p>The state legislature nicknamed California "The Golden State" back in 1968. &nbsp;Although politically and socially the "land of milk and honey" was experiencing turmoil due to riots, assassinations, and walk-outs, both economy and industry developed a burgeoning middle class and housing market. &nbsp;Although anti-communist Ronald Reagan presided over the state in 1968, this historic year shows the dramatic social and political changes that would lead California onto the path of destruction.</p>
<p>During the next four decades, our state government would grow bigger while bringing us to face a $20+ billion deficit due partly to special interest and public employee unions. &nbsp;Unfortunately, these groups are not fully to blame since voters followed the various, so-called "freedom" movements demanding more from government.</p>
<p>So, as flower children once sang "California Dreamin", today's individualists are cursing the California Nightmare! &nbsp;The dream gone badly includes historic unemployment figures, poverty rates, homelessness, foreclosures, and bankruptcies for the citizens of the 31st State in the Union. &nbsp;Furthermore, our state is ranked near last in <a href="http://idea.gseis.ucla.edu/newsroom/idea-in-the-news/education-report-california-ranks-48th-desire-for-college-vs.-reality" rel="noopener noreferrer">education</a>, freedom, and <a href="http://weblog.signonsandiego.com/weblogs/afb/archives/036304.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">business climate</a>. &nbsp;This nightmare will not go away overnight and in fact, will continue to haunt us, if We the People do not correct our mistakes and take a different course of action.</p>
<p>So, where do we begin?</p>
<p>We begin by reading both the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Constitution</a> and the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Constitution</a> to understand what REAL freedom entails. &nbsp;Bigger government is definitely not the answer. &nbsp;As soon as voters realize their dependence on government, which has been stripping them of their God-given individual rights for these past few decades, they will wake up demanding less, and seeking candidates who truly believe in freedom and liberty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can begin today a new "freedom" movement, perhaps in forty years we can once again dream in the Golden State.</p>
