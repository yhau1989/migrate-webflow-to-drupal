<p>The American Recovery and Investment 
Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus package worth a heaping $787.2 
billion, sought in part to put Americans back to work. With $71 billion 
stipulated for energy and environmental incentives, and another $20 
billion for green tax incentives, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Recovery_Act_Energy_2-17.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>that funding </span></a>has the potential to create a better environment, 
and the jobs--in California and beyond--to work toward it.  <br>
 <br>
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the package will 
increase Gross Domestic Product by 1.4 to 3.8 percent by the fourth 
quarter of 2009. In the process, that can create up to 2.3 million new 
jobs, "green" ones included. In fact, $500 million have directly 
been set aside for careers set in energy efficiency and renewable energy 
fields. <br>
 <br>
How will--and can--this affect environmental innovation in California? 
Some examples are more direct than others. Take NASA, which has some 
of its largest research centers based in the Bay Area and Pasadena, 
and is earmarked to receive $1 billion, including $400 million for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29265563/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>climate change</span></a> and other Earth science research. Other exact 
uses of the funds remain unclear. Up to <a href="http://www.stimuluswatch.org/project/view/9714" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>two billion</span></a> could go toward Solar LA, Los Angeles' plan 
to utilize 10 percent of the county's power by solar sources by 2020 
and, as a bonus, create 31,000 jobs. Such a move--though the total funding 
remains questionable until an exact breakdown occurs--is worth considering 
amidst the job crunch; the U.S. Conference of Mayors has predicted that 
134,000 jobs will be lost between now and the end of this year in LA 
county, which is basically the second highest string of employment losses 
behind New York.  <br>
 <br>
While most of the money categorized for general environmental purposes 
has yet to be divvied up, there are many more projects that stand to 
receive it. For the Golden State, that means a lot of tough decisions 
are in their hands, since states will <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/feb2009/db20090219_270845.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_news+%2B+analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>oversee 69 percent</span></a> of the stimulus money.   </p>
<p>As reported in <a href="/article/issues/2009/2/9/green" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>CAIVP</span></a> earlier this month, Southern California Edison, 
which services more than 10 million customers, may be investing $15 
billion in alternative energy for its power grids. The stimulus money 
would allow such ambitions to be brought closer to reality as $11 billion 
has been set aside for "smart grid" activities. Innovative 
green ideas such as California's Million Solar Roofs Plan, with aims 
of constructing 1 million solar rooftop installations over the next 
next ten years, can apply for a small piece of $6.3 billion of loan 
guarantees aimed at wind or solar projects. <br>
 <br>
Some scholars, writers, and organizations, such as the Heritage Foundation, 
argue that money toward such projects is being misspent, as the creation 
of these green jobs in the stimulus package could come at the poor cost 
of other ones. However, <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2009/02/18/green-jobs-%E2%80%93-in-the-stimulus-bill-but-not-in-reality/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>correlating</span></a> places like California with a high number 
of green jobs and a weak economy is a logically flawed argument which 
offers no proof. Furthermore, as<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/business/20green.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span> academic studies </span></a>have demonstrated, environmental policies in 
California have created more jobs than they have eliminated. <br>
 <br>
Yet not all is environmentally pleasing about the stimulus package's 
environmental initiatives--or, in some cases, lack there of. Congress 
scratched a $4.6 billion provision for carbon capture and sequestration 
(CCS) technologies for coal-fired power plants. Vastly more money goes 
into roads than public transit, to the point where some say it effectively <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_stimulus_screws_commuters" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>"screws commuters"</span></a> with its unequal allocation of $27 billion 
for for highways versus $8.4 billion for transit and $3.4 billion for 
rail. Still, the large amount that remains of the environmental funds are 
still a good start if California really gives some thought as to what 
organizations and plans are both in the largest financial crunch and 
will benefit the most people down the line. </p><p>As UC Berkeley Professor 
David Roland-Holst <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/blogs/news/2009/01/green_perspectives_david_rolan.php" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>aptly 
puts it</span></a>: "If investments 
are made for the New Economy, enhancing productivity, long term employment 
gains will follow."  </p><p>The money invested cannot fund all environmental 
projects--nor should it--but it can allow existing ones to operate more 
effectively and, ideally, with longer term social and environmental 
benefits.</p><p> </p>
