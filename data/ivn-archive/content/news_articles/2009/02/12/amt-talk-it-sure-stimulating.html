<p>$70 billion is the magic number being floated right now by Congressional members
trying to push along the federal government stimulus package through
both houses of Congress with bipartisan support. Those billions would
go toward fixing a terribly flawed system known as the Alternative
Minimum Tax. By Wednesday, Congressional leaders announced a middle
ground, of a stimulus plan with a price tag of $789 billion
rather than the previous bills costing upwards of $800 billion -
$1 trillion.</p>

<p>Senator Harry Reid
announced that he was "pleased.... that we've been
able to bridge those differences" between the initial Senate
and House-approved bills, which were slightly different in projects
and monetary totals. The Senate approved an $838 billion bill by
Tuesday evening, while the House of Representatives had previously
approved a bill totaling $819 billion.</p>

<p>The House bill
initially did not have the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT,
assistance that the Senate included in its version of the bill.
However, the Senate included a $70 billion earmark to "fix"
the AMT for one year. Senator Grassley of Iowa supported the
legislation. (According to some reports, there was as much as a ten
percent difference in tax cuts between the bills, with 44 percent of
the bill going toward tax cutting measures in the Senate bill, and
34 percent in the House bill.)</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation
describes the AMT as a "nefarious tax enacted... to
prevent a small number of wealthy taxpayers from using legitimate
deductions and credits to avoid paying taxes altogether," which
has morphed and "expanded relentlessly because it was never
indexed to inflation." The Heritage Foundation and others have
estimated that millions of taxpayers would be paying upwards of
$2,000 or up to $3,000 because of the AMT. The foundation estimates
that in addition to the tens of millions currently paying the AMT
this year, "approximately one in four income taxpayers will be
subject to the AMT by 2013."</p>


<p>The AMT itself is a
problematic issue. Created to protect certain levels of taxpayers, it
has become a beast itself. It was dreamed up about 40 years ago, a
"revolutionary" idea in and of itself: force all to pay
taxes (despite ignoring the fact that those opposed to high taxes
will always find ways to avoid them) by devising an "extra"
tax system, to ensure that the majestically wealthy were forced to
give their money to the state. (Fun, right?)</p>

<p>By 1970, it was put into
reality as a way to ensure that certain very high income earners were
not simply using flexible tax loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
Unfortunately, the AMT is not indexed annually for inflation, which
has had the unfortunate side effect of forcing middle class and lower
class earners to be subject to AMT regulations. Additionally,
exemptions and stock options can also be taxed under this system, no
matter how wealthy (or not wealthy) the tax filer is. Official
estimates in recent years have predicted gloomy scenarios: by 2010,
if the AMT is not adjusted accordingly, nearly 20 percent of
taxpayers may be subject to AMT whims, despite their lowered income
levels. 
</p>


<p>On Wednesday during a
press conference, Steny Hoyer, Majority Leader of the House, stated his belief that the one-year AMT patch will
be kept in the final version of the stimulus package: "I don't
think they're going to take that [the AMT patch] out," he said.
However, this "fix" will only be slated to last through
2010. It has been thought that the only reason the $70 billion
patch is even in place has nothing to do with stimulating the
economy, but is only something to sweeten the deal for reluctant
Republicans. It is being estimated that 24 million additional
tax-paying families may be affected by the AMT this year, and by next
year, with inflation still not being accounted for in the autonomous
AMT tax, nearly 40 million additional taxpayers would be subject to
the tax! Sadly, even those earning under $100,000 may be subject to
this outdated and frivolous tax. This is a perfect example of an
ideal, when put into practice, gone terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Take a look
at the 2008 AMT tax form online, and <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f6251.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="see for yourself.">see for yourself.</a>(PDF)</p>

<p>Some of the biggest
losers this time around include the unemployed and the education
system, which both will receive less funding as a result of the $70
billion for the AMT fix. In California, the higher education system
has already been a big loser in this year's budget, with the
community colleges, California State University and University of
California systems all facing funding cuts already. Additional
federal taxes would be a deadly blow to the pockets of already
over-taxed Californians, who already face the highest income tax in
the entire nation. In addition to property taxes, even those earning lower salaries
may be subject to the AMT (in addition to federal and state taxes),
simply because of the rate of their property taxes (which are
generally between 1-2% alone in Southern California counties.)</p>

<p>It's time to repeal the AMT, and
repeal it now.
