<p>The economic scholar Ronald Coase once characterized the
market as "islands of butter in a pail of buttermilk." Similarly,
President Obama's stimulus package could be characterized as islands of sense
in an ocean of politics-as-usual. And one of those islands happens,
fortunately, to be the Congress's efforts to remove $70 billion from the
alternative minimum tax, a cruelly designed trap for the successful, with the
express purpose of maximizing bracket creep while minimizing upward mobility.
</p><p>If President Obama's rhetoric about the middle class were more than rhetoric,
than this is one portion of the bill upon which he ought not to compromise,
especially when one of the largest states in the union needs this tax reformed
so drastically.<br>
<br>
California's economic problems,
and the already crushing tax burden which will be added after the passage of
Governor Schwarzenegger's "compromise" with the Democrats are reason
enough for taxes to be cut, but the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is
an especially juicy, ripe subject for cutting. </p><p>It is a rhetorical winner for
the anti-State brigades if ever there were one, especially because the AMT
in its present form puts the lie to the Democratic obsession with "helping
out the little guy" for several scandalously blatant reasons.</p>

<p>But first, what is the Alternative Minimum Tax? To put it
bluntly, it's a tax intended to make sure that people still pay at least <i>some</i> taxes, and hails from an earlier
era when tax shelters were as plentiful as parasitic social workers. According
to the AMT, if someone is paying below a
certain amount of taxation because of tax deductions etc, they become subject
to the AMT, which is currently set above 20 percent. </p>

<p>Now, one might ask, what's wrong with making sure that people pay their fair
share? Alan Viard, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has
suggested several things already in his <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=5591" rel="noopener noreferrer">testimony
before Congress</a> last year. In the first place, Viard points out, the
AMT is not indexed to inflation, meaning that any decrease
in the value of the dollar will go unnoticed in the tax's implementation. This
wouldn't be a problem in the short term, but unfortunately, the AMT
is not a short-term policy. It has existed since 1969 and as such, the burden
of its implementation falls not on the malevolent, heartless, grasping worms
who <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/spread-the-weal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">make
$250,000 or more</a>, but rather on people who make as little $30,000-$50,000
dollars, a sum so small that <a href="http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/12.13/99-finaid.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">some
colleges</a> would automatically give their children full scholarships! <br>
<br>
Of course, this sharply regressive outcome can't be expected to inspire genuine
bipartisanship, as several Democrats have already begun pointing the
AMT as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/09/AR2009010903653.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pandering
to the rich and powerful</a>. One particularly priceless quote comes from South
Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn, who argued that "you can't get people
back to work using tax cuts." Dear, dear, someone hasn't been paying
attention to the presidential talking points about discredited policy -- I suppose
Mr. Clyburn doesn't know the Laffer Curve exists either.</p>



<p>However, for the sake of argument, let's ignore the
regressive nature of the tax and entertain his conjecture: even if the tax
hits lower income earners harder, at least it gets people back to work, right? Right?</p>



<p>Wrong. Consider: if a worker knows that, once he reaches an
income level even above bare subsistence, he will be taxed out of his wits,
then that worker has absolutely no incentive to pursue even the most basic
forms of self-advancement. In fact, that worker might have an incentive to
avoid getting into a job where he could make something above the dreaded
$30,000 mark altogether! Hardly a way to get people "back to work."</p>



<p>Which is why we must continue to pursue the reduction in this absolutely inexcusable tax, which in turn will hopefully
be the first step toward eliminating it altogether. If that happens, then maybe
there will be some cause for the presidential rhetoric of "hope and change."</p>
