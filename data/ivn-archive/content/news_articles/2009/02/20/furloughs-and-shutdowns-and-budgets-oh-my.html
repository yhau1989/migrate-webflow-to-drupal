<p>There is a great movie in which a person decides that he wants to bring down a huge and prosperous 
company. The best way to do so, he decides, is to do so from the inside, 
intentionally running things so slap-dash and inefficiently, as to force 
the company into a tailspin. As things go down, down, down, some of 
the top members head for the hills. As their last resort, all of the 
fellow employees turn to their CEO, who was less of a micromanager than 
a laissez-faire type of guy everyone likes. With his reputation and 
future on the line, he must ask himself, like the proverbial last person 
left with the bill, what does he do? What DOES he do??</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a movie. 
In the real world, one person is not responsible for the sad state of 
California's budget fiasco. Sadly, all of the residents of this "company" 
are indeed at the mercy of the few who helped get us here in the first 
place. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the poor guy stuck with the bill, 
working his best magic to keep state employee jobs, while trying to 
trim the fat off a hugely bloated budget. </p><p>Back in December 2008, the 
governor signed Executive Order S-16-08, authorizing the mandatory unpaid 
furloughs. The order states that "that effective February 1, 2009 
through June 30, 2010, the Department of Personnel Administration shall 
adopt a plan to implement a furlough of represented state employees 
and supervisors for two days per month, regardless of funding source."</p>
<p>The two days were to be the 
first and third Friday of every month, or two days of unpaid vacation 
time every month. Considering the alternative (losing a job entirely), 
two days unpaid is a pretty good deal.  February 1 came and went, as 
did February 5. And the best part? The state didn't erupt into disarray 
and chaos.</p>
<p>According to reports, just 
some of the state offices that will be expected to continuing shutting 
down twice monthly include the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Agriculture and the 
Department of Fish and Game. In the December order, it was also "requested" 
that "other entities of State government not under [the governor's] 
direct executive authority, including the California Public Utilities 
Commission, the University of California, the California State University, 
California Community Colleges, the legislative branch (including the 
Legislative Counsel Bureau), and judicial branch, implement similar 
or other mitigation measures to achieve budget and cash savings for 
the current and next fiscal year."</p>
<p>Listen. Did you hear that? 
The relative silence on the part of the workers taking furloughs. Perhaps 
that is because so many others are losing their jobs and homes. Though 
the IOUs have yet to start filing in, the California state government 
is still going, furloughs and on, on what we must all hope is the path 
to a healthier California. Now if only we could wrestle with those pesky 
tax rates...</p>
