<p>With a likelihood of a $47 million decrease in funding and $340 million 
in deferred payments from the state, California's 110 community colleges 
have not escaped the doom-and-gloom of budget cuts. Couple that with 
the daunting statistic of a <a href="http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/feb/19/1m19scott001049-community-colleges-unable-meet-dem/?zIndex=55260" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>10 
percent increase</span></a> in applications 
this year, a trend that echoes in different proportions <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-1393-Education-Improvement-Examiner%7Ey2009m2d18-Student-enrollment-rising-at-many-colleges" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>around the country</span></a>, and the result could be a 5 percent cut 
in classes. However, creative solutions could guarantee that community 
colleges, and their students, escape the financial crunch less scathed 
than the numbers predict. <br>
 <br>
The system, which enrolls 2.7 million students statewide, still has 
options to make it easier for its students to stay enrolled, and allow 
higher degree seekers easier access to the four year institutions they 
desire. For one, California's community colleges should consider offering 
more online and distance learning classes. Students whose local community 
college does not offer, say, UC or CSU transferable Art History or Statistics 
courses should look into ones, even those based afar, that do. Plenty 
of institutions, such as <a href="http://www.dvc.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Diablo 
Valley College</span></a>, based in 
Concord, are an academic gold mine of classes that make the cut--and 
do not ever require its students to set foot in the classroom. Web sites 
such as <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Assist.org</span></a> are specifically set up to tell students whether 
their courses, online and distance learning included, are transferable 
to their institution of choice. <br>
 <br>
Community colleges should also consider modifying their enrollment policy. 
Now, almost anyone who is a California resident easily fits the bill 
for acceptance to the $20-per-unit institutions. While a large number 
of applicants are Associates or Bachelor degree seeking, many are likely 
simply looking to augment their skills, cater to their intellectual 
curiosity or delve into a change of scenery. While these folks should 
be able to take advantage of the colleges' offerings, they should not--at 
least in times of a deficit--be given completely equal footing with 
students seeking to gain a degree or transfer in the near future. Impacted 
classes that are UC and CSU transferable--or that students can prove 
transfer to another institution of their liking-- should give priority 
enrollment to students who state on their application that they aim 
to transfer. Granted, there is no way to hold them to their words, but 
it will at least trim classes down, allowing more students to gain the 
classes they need--and the opportunities they will provide down the 
line. <br>
 <br>
Still, there is no grade-A solution to the colleges' financial woes. 
Schools still have to pay instructors to lead online courses, or create 
them. However, they are saved from construction costs, as classrooms 
are replaced with with virtual ones, and programs such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCT" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>WebCT</span></a> allow for easy online course design. Educational 
experts have oft argued that in-person learning is the most effective, 
and some students learn best when their teacher exists in human, rather 
than computerized, form. But to adhere to the old "desperate times 
call for desperate measures" aphorism, offering transferable classes, 
in whatever format, should be the aim right now. Furthermore, traditional 
classes would not be eliminated, they would just be complimented with 
alternatives. <br>
 <br>
California community colleges currently <a href="http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_c=xs2pp1v27g11k2&amp;issueId=xs2mcgee6lxx8h&amp;xid=xs2pdxm23e111f" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>await stimulus package funds</span></a>, which they should seek to utilize in the 
most efficient way possible. That should not making it easier--rather 
than the other way around--for California residents, and degree seekers, 
to meet their goals. As CSUs and UCs have already put a ceiling on enrollment, 
there needs to be another viable option.</p>
