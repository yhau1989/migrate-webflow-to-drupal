<p>California is one state Senate vote 
away from having a balanced budget through what's left of this year, 
and 2009-2010 as well. Though how that vote will come is still playing 
out, and it seems likely to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>This is a good thing. For too long, 
California's uncertain finances have wreaked havoc on people 
who work for the state, and those who depend on state services.</p>
<p>For state residents who don't fall 
into this category, the state's fiscal woes had a more dislocated 
effect, coming as they do on top (and partly because) of a housing meltdown 
and job market deflation. The combined headlines might make us longtime 
Californians, normally smug this time of year because of cold weather 
elsewhere, a bit more modest. (Did I mention a drought, too?)</p>
<p>But the caveat for the budget's final 
creation is one that should alarm state government watchers who ponder 
the long-term picture.</p>
<p>Chief among this is the precedent Sacramento 
lawmakers have set: Budget by wish list.</p>
<p>The first came when legislative Democratic 
leadership, in the majority party, agreed to a shopping list of policy 
changes from their Republican counterparts.</p>
<p>That there was haggling over such topics like spending cuts and new taxes was to be expected -- these are critical 
issues that are part of every budget discussion, and they took on greater 
significance this year.</p>
<p>But the deal both sides agreed on -- 
mind you, just to have an agreement that could be taken to the full 
membership, not necessarily a final one -- involved much more.</p>
<p>Republicans, who hold effective veto 
power with a two-thirds vote requiring at least a few of them to cross 
party lines, managed to get other goodies in that agreement as well.</p>
<p>They include the spending cap proposal 
for voters and rollbacks on environmental law to speed along construction 
projects.</p>
<p>Such provisions have been long sought-after 
goals of California Republicans, and they have merit for discussion. 
But they are only tangentially related to the state's finances. And 
for someone who points out that the state's lack of a spending cap 
makes its finances more unwieldy, it should be noted that a little over 
three years ago, voters were given the chance to enact such a cap, and 
decided against it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that was the agreement 
that put the package before the full state Senate and Assembly. Where...it...promptly...stalled.</p>
<p>Reason being, there weren't enough 
Republican votes in the Senate for passage. That was even though the 
Republican leadership had loaded the measure up with prime-cut steaks 
for its red meat caucus.</p>
<p>Sen. Abel Maldonado (R-Santa Maria), 
a moderate, said he couldn't be one of the three critical GOP votes 
for the budget's passage. That is, unless Democrats took a look at 
his personal wish list. Some of which had to do with the budget. Some 
of which did not.</p>
<p>Democrats agreed to do so, and ultimately, 
it's likely that Maldonado will be the needed vote for passage. But 
the precedent set here is worrisome.</p>
<p> Most years, passing the budget is 
a difficult process, though this year may dwarf them all. And giving 
a legislator - or a caucus - its druthers in return for votes could 
bespeak future troubles.</p>
<p>Legislators, by virtue of being both 
term limited and increasingly partisan, sometimes have interests and 
desires different from the state's residents as a whole. Not necessarily 
worse, but different.</p>
<p>If every potentially recalcitrant legislator 
can submit their own wish list in order to guarantee a budget vote, 
a state already known for slow government could theoretically get slower, 
something like sloth to snail speed.</p>
<p>Is there a better way? Willie Brown, 
for one, might suggest that there is.</p>
<p>During a previous budget stall, Brown, 
in a column for the San Francisco Chronicle, said as Assembly Speaker, 
he had a sure-fire method to get a needed vote during a protracted budget 
standoff.</p>
<p>Go to the legislator, he said, and 
offer up some local benefits to smooth the way. Some police funding  
here, a community center grant there.</p>
<p>Horse-trading? Unethical? Poor spending 
choice? Perhaps, all three.</p>
<p>But better those, at relatively small 
amounts, than giving government reform options to every lawmaker who's 
willing to get married to a budget deal, but not without a pre-nup.</p>
