<p>Times, 
like patterns, ebb and flow predictably with time. There is still hope 
that the economic crisis of 2008-2009 will not be nearly as bad as the 
Great Depression, despite the widespread failure of banks. And various 
cities across California are dealing with the situation as they best 
see fit, with belt tightening and spending, hoping to receive greater 
returns.</p><p>In San Francisco, old ideas 
and new are being mixed together to provide a hoped-for local stimulating 
effect. A "jobs payroll tax credit" is being floated, as the Mayor's 
Office notes that "businesses that add jobs over the next two years 
will not have to pay the city's 1.5 percent payroll tax on those new 
positions," which is hoped to spur both employment and to encourage 
businesses to flourish in the city by the Bay. SF faces its own local 
budget shortfall, to the tune of $126.9 million. Further tax credit 
programs for families and businesses are set to be implemented, along 
with programs to give tax relief to companies participating in community 
programs and events. </p><p>There is even talk of a program to help teach "financial 
literacy" through the "Bank on San Francisco" program. Tax credits/relief 
and teaching responsible use of finances: these are certainly not new 
ideas, but they are good ones.</p>
<p>Last week, Major Newsom <a href="http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=19413" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced his own "stimulus proposal"</a> that focused on "expediting infrastructure projects and granting loans and tax credits to local businesses." The city will have a government program that will make loans to small businesses, and 
there is a planned rebate of 50 percent "of the property tax that businesses 
pay for unsecured property" so long as said goods were purchased in 
San Francisco.</p>
<p>Kevin Johnson, the mayor of 
Sacramento, even publicly mulled over the idea of freezing his salary 
and the salaries of his staff. Even Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los 
Angeles recently announced the availability of government programs to 
help jobseekers, in tandem with the community centers available for 
mental health support in this time of economic pain. Mayor Jerry Sanders 
of San Diego is asking residents to interact with the state government 
to suggest what should be included in the upcoming budget. </p><p>Like many 
of its sister cities throughout California and the nation, San Diego 
also faces a budget deficit, specifically of over $50 million (a sum 
which dwarfs in comparison to cities like San Francisco, which face 
budget shortfalls in excess of $100 million). In a press release, Mayor 
Sanders explained that "Like most American cities, San Diego has been 
hurt by the national recession and needs to make difficult decisions 
to balance its budget." The mayor also expressed his "great appreciation 
for the common sense of San Diegans," and encouraged residents to 
share ideas on reductions, streamlining and increasing revenues.</p>
<p>A big heaping dose of common 
sense is exactly what our politicians need. May San Diego lead the way 
in its straightforward path back to functionality and prosperity.</p>
