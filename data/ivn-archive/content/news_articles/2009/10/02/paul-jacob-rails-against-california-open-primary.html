<p>Over at <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/PaulJacob/2009/09/27/one_shout_of_you_lie_is_no_excuse_to_conjure_up_reforms_best_handled_with_a_simple_youve_got_to_be_kidding?page=full&amp;comments=true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Townhall.com</a>, columnist Paul Jacob excorciates California's 2010 "Top-Two" open primary initiative on the 2010 ballot.* &nbsp;Pointing to Washington state as the most recent example, Jacob posits that an open primary will further entrench incumbents and restrict authentic voter choice. &nbsp;In Jacob's view, an open primary will severely limit much-needed political competition by all but eliminating independent and third-party candidates.</p>
