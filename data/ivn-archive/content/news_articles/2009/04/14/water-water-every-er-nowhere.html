<p>I remember back in school, when one kid seemed to be taking too long at the drinking fountain,  the next person would yell  "Save some 
for the fishes!" Is the newest appropriate response instead, "Save 
some for the Californians!"?</p>
<p>Over the past year, a number 
of California cities and counties have been kicking into the water 
conservation effort, with water conservation programs, rebates, free 
water-saving tips and diagnostics, and more. Placer County's American 
Water recently began asking customers to take part in a "voluntary 
conservation" measure, while the City of Beverly Hills enacted two 
new water conservation ordinances at the end of Mach.</p>
<p>Beverly Hills put 
in place two new plans to save water: one concerns outside water use 
(the Efficient Landscape ordinance) and "start irrigation controllers," 
which are also known as "smart sprinkler controllers" or "weather-based 
irrigation devices. These are basically home (and office) sprinkler 
systems that are able to independently gage when to save water, and 
curtail excess water use. The new rule makes it mandatory for all newly 
installed or updated "landscaped areas to be equipped with smart irrigation 
controllers... [which] manage landscaping watering needs based on weather 
and site specific requirements."</p>
<p>And to enforce this new water-saving 
rule, residents and property owners will be obligated to obtain new 
permits, submit landscaping plans and obtain certification from designation 
experts. In the plan, property owners must "plant materials... according 
to similar water needs, where feasible," must plan to address "erosion 
and runoff controls" in their plan, and must make sure that "irrigation 
systems are equipped with smart irrigation controllers."</p>
<p>Irrigation experts have estimated 
that 50 percent or more of the average homeowner's water consumption 
is due to irrigation and outside water use. Smart sprinklers may cost 
a pretty penny, but often may save significantly more than they cost; 
and with the many rebates offered by California water districts, the 
price of such water-saving devices is often slashed by a significant 
percentage. The city of BH estimates that smart sprinklers can save 
13,500 gallons of water every year, in addition to saving more than 
$700 on water bills.</p>
<p>Beverly Hills also 
put into play a second ordinance, which requires residents selling any 
property within the bounds of the city, to retrofit their properties 
"with low consumption showerheads, toilets, faucets, and urinals at 
the time a property is sold."</p>
<p>Many water districts have been 
getting involved with water conservation issues, from offering generous 
rebates on the purchase of water-saving items (including the smart sprinkler 
controllers, low-flow toilets, specialized faucets and shower sprinklerheads, 
laundry machines and dryers) to offering water conservation tips, free 
seminars on landscaping and garden tours of landscapes with native/drought-tolerant 
plants, offering contests and prizes, and sending out representatives 
for free water-saving "house calls" to help homeowners assess their 
individual water needs and where they can save more water. These days, 
anything to save money is welcome; saving water most definitely translates 
to saving money. And with the threat of water rationing, if the current 
situation does not improve through spring, the threat of elevated water 
prices in California is a reality.</p>
<p>California congressional leaders 
such as Ken Calvert have simultaneously been lobbying for federal restrictions 
on water pumping to be removed or loosened, in the golden, but dry, 
state of California. This call for loosened restrictions came as a result 
of the recent judge-ordered ruling that the San Joaquin Delta be basically 
locked down from Southern California, which relies on the San Joaquin 
area for quite a bit of its water reserves. Ostensibly, the ruling was 
made after it was found that a certain fish may have been going down 
in population, with the pumping. Others have argued that the well-being 
of Southern California residents (remember, Los Angeles was once a desert) 
is more vital than the call of environmentalism. In 2008, Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger declared the state to be in a state of emergency, after 
a dry spell officially brought the Golden State into a drought.</p>
<p>Calvert, a representative based 
in Riverside County, has cut his teeth on matters intersecting technology, 
water and government. Calvert is on the Water and Power Subcommittee, 
for which he was the chairman. In that capacity, he dealt with matters 
of Western water issues and federal rights, alternative (water-related) 
technologies, and previously introduced the Water Supply, Reliability 
and Environmental Improvement Act. According to Congressman Calvert's 
official Web site, one of his goals for the 110<sup>th</sup> Congress 
include "creating long-term solutions to California's energy and water 
problems."</p>
<p>In the past, Calvert has sponsored 
and introduced legislation to promote the building and maintenance of 
facilities near the Santa Ana River and San Juan Capistrano, for water 
treatment, recycling and other irrigation projects.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to save 
water in California, and fortunately, there are also many ways to save 
water, on a daily basis. Further consideration and planning is needed 
to ensure that enough water continues to be provided to California residents. 
If a ruling to close off the San Joaquin Delta is upheld, perhaps the 
same judge can help think up a way to ensure the continued flow of imported 
water to Southern California.</p>
