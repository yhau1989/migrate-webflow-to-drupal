<p>No government officials ended 
up in bodies of water or tarred and feathered, though the message was clear.</p>
<p>The nationally-synchronized 
Tea Parties of April 15 brought out citizens of all stripes on 
April 15, with a common message to the federal government: "Don't 
tread on me!"</p>
<p>The Tea Parties, which have 
been organizing and galvanizing for about two months now, saw thousands 
of participants turning out around the country, and around California, 
for the April 15 "celebration" of sorts, or protest, depending on 
how you look at it. With rising deficits and recent news of more than 
$1 trillion in borrowing and government spending, many citizens have 
become firmly opposed to the idea of unbridled spending against future 
revenues, without having their voices heard at the metaphorical bargaining 
table.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.freedomworks.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreedomWorks.org</a> 
(one of the big organizers of the Tea Party events), protests were set 
to take place throughout all of California, mainly concentrated between 
San Diego in to the South and San Francisco in the North. Santa Monica 
(with 181 protestors RSVPing in the affirmative), Santa Barbara, Hollister, 
South Bay, Merced, Atascadero, Los Angeles/San Fernando/Santa Clarita 
Valley, Lodi, Glendale, Walnut Creek, Redding, Sacramento, Temecula, 
Ventura, Bakersfield, Oceanside, San Jose, Chico, Napa, Orange County, 
Simi Valley, and Redondo/Manhattan Beach: these are just some of the 
cities which held Tea Parties on April 15.</p>
<p> One attendee posted on the 
FreedomWorks Web site that 7,500 people attended the Central Valley 
Tea Party, while another alerted readers to a Tea Party in Santa Monica.</p>

<p>Groups met throughout California, 
protesting recent announcements of huge spending increases, funded by 
American taxpayer dollars, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act, noted by many for its many questionable earmarks (tattoo removal 
as stimulus? Really? Water park for economic recovery?) .</p>
<p>The well-organized Tea Parties 
hearken back to days of lower taxation and less federal government reach 
over the lives of individuals. One California Tea Party group met (very 
appropriately) at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. Some 
protestors carried signs protesting high taxes, one wore a Joe Biden 
mask while holding a sign designating the high taxes as the work of 
fools, while one member even protested the Federal Reserve (though that 
individual did not appear to be part of the main Tea Party itself).</p>
<p>In Ventura County, Tea Party 
attendees had planned to meet around the county government office, and 
had expected various media outlets to also arrive on scene.</p>
<p>In Santa Barbara, the Tax Day 
Tea Party met at 1:00 p.m. along the downtown State Street 
at Alameda Park. Live music, protest songs and a half mile march to the 
IRS building on State Street were highlights of the schedule.</p>

<p>If citizens continue to be 
taxed beyond their means, more tea parties are sure to be expected in the future. </p>
