<p> </p><p>SAN FRANCISCO -- In an announcement that
shocked few in the Golden State political world, San Francisco Mayor
Gavin Newsom announced that he will run for governor in 2010 on
Tuesday morning. 


   </p><p>Newsom ended an extended period of exploration
for the office after conducting a series of town hall meetings across
the state. Newsom made his announcement nearly
simultaneously via YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. 


  </p><p>"I'm a candidate for governor of California because I know we can do better," Newsom said in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH0jnyuJ1Tg&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> spot. "I've seen what can happen when we stop looking back and start looking forward for solutions."</p><p>The 41-year-old Newsom touted San Francisco's
success in healthcare and education and for its comparative stable
muncipal finances. </p><p>


   "We figured out that sound fiscal policy isn't conservative or progressive, it's just plain smart for everyone." 


  Newsom's candidacy in the race to replace the
termed out Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger follows Lt. Gov. John Garamendi
who has been an announced candidate for several months now.</p><p>
    The
other two high-profile candidate "shoes" that have yet to drop in the
race include those of Attorney General Jerry Brown and U.S. Senator
Dianne Feinstein. 
  </p>
<p>  </p><p>
    Brown,
who previously served as governor in the pre-term limit mid-1970's, is
widely expected to run again. Feinstein, a formidable electoral threat
to all Democrats, is expected to remain in Washington as chairwoman of
the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee. Finally, Los Angeles Mayor
Antonio Villaraigosa has made no secret that he too would like to be
governor. 
  </p>
<p>  </p><p>
    Garamendi,
a perennial gubernatorial candidate, has also indicated lately that he
may ultimately take a differnt path and pursue running for the
soon-to-be vacated seat held by U.S. Rep. Ellen Tauscher in the 10th
Congressional District instead. Tauscher is expected to be appointed
Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security in
the Obama Administration.

    Amongst
Republicans gunning for governor in 2010, the candidate field is much
smaller. GOPers so far interested in the job include former eBay CEO
Meg Whitman, former Congressman Tom Campbell and Insurance Commissioner
Steve Poizner.
