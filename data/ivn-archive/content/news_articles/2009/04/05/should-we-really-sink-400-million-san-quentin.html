<p>Sometimes
the right idea comes along at the wrong time.</p>

<p>Such is
the case with state <a href="http://cssrc.us/web/12/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Jeff
Denham's</a> plan to sell the San Quentin Prison site for enough money to build
a new Death Row and contribute a sizable chunk to the general fund as well.</p>

<p>The
Merced County Republican, and declared candidate for lieutenant governor, has
pitched this idea before. <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_1751-1800/sb_1751_cfa_20040413_160813_sen_comm.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ridding
the state of surplus property</a> has been a theme for him from practically the
time he took office in 2003.</p>

<p>This
year, he's behind a 10-bill package designed to <a href="http://cssrc.us/web/12/news.aspx?id=5218" rel="noopener noreferrer">get California "off
its lazy assets,"</a> as he put it, including:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_28_bill_20081202_introduced.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB
     28</a> would require the decommissioning San Quentin and selling the 432
     acres in Marin
      County, which Denham
     values at $2 billion;</li><li><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_29_bill_20081202_introduced.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB
     29</a> would require the sale of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and
     Sports Arena land parcel, which Denham believes would bring $240 million
     to $400 million</li><li><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_30_bill_20081202_introduced.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB
     30</a> would direct the Department of General Services to identify at
     least $1 billion in additional state property that could be sold
     immediately to help close the state's budget deficit. It would
     require all state agencies to evaluate whether leasing back the space they
     current occupy or finding "more cost-effective space" would save
     the state money.</li></ul>

<p>The San
Quentin proposal <a href="http://thehive.modbee.com/node/13328" rel="noopener noreferrer">drew a lot of attention last
week</a> when the Senate Committee on Public Safety put the bill on hold.
That's probably because in the current climate, any proposal that would bring in
as little as an extra dime is going to get a more serious look than it has in
the past.</p>

<p>Committee
Chairman Mark Leno said the bill was held because of a standing policy to hold
any bills that would increase prison crowding. That's sound policy in the
current <a href="/article/taxes/2009/3/29/prison-spending-age-recession" rel="noopener noreferrer">"how
much is the receiver going to make us spend"</a> climate.</p>

<p>What
isn't sound policy: The state's commitment to sinking $400 million into
expanding San Quentin even though the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office
has serious concerns.</p>

<p>"Questions
about the cost of the new Death Row complex, and the possible effect of inmate
population limits at the prison, should be resolved before the Legislature
considers the project further," <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/analysis_2008/crim_justice/cj_anl08012.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">an
LAO report says</a>.</p>

<p>At the
least, the Legislature needs to know what construction estimates have tripled
in five years, the report continues.</p>

<p>It's not
the first time the LAO has questioned the project. The office <a href="http://www.marinij.com/fastsearchresults/ci_5279042" rel="noopener noreferrer">also recommended
scrapping it</a> in 2007, in response to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's budget at
the time.</p>

<p>Still,
when it comes to selling San Quentin, Leno has a point about not increasing
prison crowding right now, and Denham's timing for the sale isn't exactly
ideal.</p>

<p><a href="http://marinrealestatebubble.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marin County real estate
prices</a> have tumbled right along with the rest of the state and, combined
with the questionable waiver of environmental laws Denham wants to bestow on
whoever buys the property, it could add up to a bit of a giveaway for the
state.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
