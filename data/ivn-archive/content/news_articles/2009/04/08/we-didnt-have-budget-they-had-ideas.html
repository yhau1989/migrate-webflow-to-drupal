<p>True, California did not have 
a cohesive budget for months. Even while the governor struggled to force cohesion, 
even mandating that state employees take a proverbial during the work week. But state legislators didn't let that keep them from promoting... 
other legislation. From December 2008 through February 2009, Governor 
Schwarzenegger appeared to be cajoling legislators into doing their 
jobs, and it certainly appeared that his work was like pulling teeth.</p>
<p>Member of the State Senate 
and Assembly did not come to a budgetary agreement until February 2009, 
but before then, a number of less than hard-hitting amendments were 
proposed, including the State Senate's "Relative to Irish American 
Heritage Month" proclamation, and the "Relative to Greek Independence 
Day."</p>
<p>Give the legislators a hand: 
despite incredible odds, they kept open minds... or something like that. 
On February 19, 2009, state representatives agreed to a statewide budget, 
and plan to bring under control the $42 billion budget.</p>
<p>S.C.R. No. 17-C was introduced 
on December 17, 2008. On February 4, it received analysis on the
Senate floor, at which time it was "resolved by the Senate of the 
State of California" that March 25, 2009 would be recognized as Greek 
Independence Day. In December, Representative Alquist was thinking four 
months ahead to a March celebration, though a majority of legislators 
still could not put it upon themselves to also pen a budget.</p>
<p>In the Assembly, on January 
7, Assembly Member Hayashi introduced ACR 9, a resolution to celebrate 
January 13, 2009 as Korean-American Day (one month and twelve days before 
the budget's passage). There was no noted opposition on the Assembly 
or State Senate floors. Bill ACR No. 20, pertaining to Black History 
Month, was introduced on February 11 (eight days before the budget's 
passing). Bill AB 64 was introduced on December 9, 2008 (two months 
and 10 days before the budget's passage), which dealt with renewable 
energy topics. (Funny thing is, it's hard to invest extra money in 
renewable energy projects, when there isn't a budget to spend, eh?) 
AB 87 was introduced in the Assembly on January 5, 2009 (one month and 
14 days before the budget's passage), dealing with "single-use carryout 
bags," promoting recycling alternatives and information on the "environmental 
effects" of said bags.</p>
<p>Ok, and even though this one 
was introduced right after the budget was passed (eight days later, 
on February 27), it's still a keeper: Senate Bill S.B. No. 750, pertaining to "Exotic animals: kangaroos" and prohibiting 
the "importation for commercial purposes inapplicable to the dead 
body of any kangaroo. It would delete the exception and the January 
1, 2011, termination date" of the current law, which "generally 
provides that it is a crime to import for commercial purposes, possess 
with intent to sell, or sell any part or product of the dead body of 
a kangaroo, subject to specified misdemeanor penalties for each violation. 
However, until January 1, 2011, exception is made for kangaroos that 
may be harvested lawfully under Australian national and state law, the 
federal Endangered Species Act of 1971, and applicable international 
conventions, under specified conditions." YES!</p>
<p>Does anyone else get the impression 
that procrastination played a huge part in the budget fiasco? I thought 
the state leaders were elected to do the work others didn't want to 
do...</p>
