<p>Anytime something happens on 
April Fool's, one must be suspicious: Was it a prank? An excellently-timed 
joke, planned just in time for that most merrymaking of days?</p>
<p>In the case of California's 
sales tax, it was no joke. On Wednesday, April 1, the California state 
sales tax officially went up one percent, to a nice, round six percent. 
And for certain counties with already-high sales tax rates, this bumps 
it up to closer to nine percent.</p>
<p>The sales tax increase is one 
leg of the governor's plan to balance the rather defunct state budget. 
It was (optimistically) estimated that the temporary sales tax increase 
would bring in well over $10 billion in additional state revenue. The 
budget balancing plan, put in place to solve the more-than $40 billion 
state deficit, relies on a nearly 50-50 split between spending cuts 
and tax increases.</p>
<p>As of right now, the "temporary" 
sales tax fix will only run through for the next two and a half years 
(July 2011), though if the governor is victorious in his quest to get 
Proposition A1, the Budget Stabilization Act, passed, the elevated sales 
tax will remain in place for one additional year, through July 2012. 
The election to decide on this and other measures, will take place on 
May 19. (In addition to the sales tax increase, personal income tax 
rates will also rise, in addition to vehicle licensing fees, just like 
former Governor Davis proposed, before being ousted in a special election.)</p>
<p>Depending on where you live, 
one percent, particularly on more expensive items, makes a big difference. 
</p><p>Don't be surprised to hear about more inter-city and inter-county 
shopping, as residents of higher sales tax area mosey over to the cities 
with lower penalties, er, taxes. </p><p>To figure out whether or not you should 
shop in your own city or in the town over, here is a simple trick: find 
out what your city/county taxation rate is. Then, locate the nearest 
city to you with a tax rate that is lower. Estimate what you might be 
spending on a particular shopping trip (say you are looking to remodel), 
and see how much more you are spending in the city with the higher sales 
tax rate. Then, go ahead and save that money by shopping in the less 
expensive locale. Hey, maybe the sales tax rate with actually help cities 
with lower sales tax rates! Oh, that's right, that would mean the 
other cities are getting the short end of the stick. </p><p>The California 
State Board of Equilization has provided a link by which consumers can 
check their <a href="http://www.boe.ca.gov/news/pdf/l212b.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>new 
local sales tax rates</span></a>.

tax rate are Los Angeles (at 9.5%), Contra Costa, San Mateo and Santa 
Clara (all three at 9.25%), Santa Cruz (9%), Sonoma (9%),</p>

tax rate, including, notably, Santa Barbara, West Sacramento, Oxnard, 
Pismo Beach, the City of San Luis Obispo, Fort Bragg, Salinas, Riverside 
County, San Diego County, Orange County and Mariposa County.</p>

Some experts have already expressed 
concern that the elevated levels of taxation will in fact, do more harm 
than good, particularly in the midst of the current stinging recession, 
which has hit California hard. It's basic economics: when people have 
less money, they're more apt to save it. </p><p>Increasing taxes, in a recession, 
has never been a brilliant move, and never will be.
