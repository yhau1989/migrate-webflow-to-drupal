<p>California State Senator Tony Strickland introduced a range of ideas on energy this month in Carpinteria, just outside Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Strickland has stated his intention 
to work across party lines "to transition California to a renewable, 
more energy efficient economy to jumpstart the economy, reduce our dependence 
on foreign oil, improve the environment, and lower energy prices."</p>
<p>Though it may be surprising 
to see one congressman putting forth such a detailed and 
varied plan to utilize alternative energy sources and phase out the 
old, it should come as no surprise now, as Strickland is also 
the VP of GreenWave Energy Solutions, a "green" interest and alternative energy company that 
focuses on ocean energy. Strickland 
advocates that "California must transition to a renewable, more energy-efficient 
economy to jumpstart the economy, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, 
improve the environment, and lower energy prices."</p>
<p>Strickland, a Republican representative 
of a number of cities through Los Angeles County, Ventura County and 
Santa Barbara County, has been pushing for cleaner energy alternatives 
through a number of new bills and suggestions. Some of Strickland's 
proposed bills include calls to support various alternative energy forms 
(including geothermal, solar and wind energy), cutting red tape for 
those interested in supporting alternative energies, offering tax credits 
for those supporting alternative energy projects and other ideas.</p>
<p>Strickland's Web site showcases 
the his dedication to renewable energy sources: 
"I believe California needs to transition to a renewable, more energy 
efficient economy to jumpstart the economy, reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil, improve the environment, and lower energy prices."</p><p> </p><p>Strickland introduced a bill on February 26 that would offer a "credit... not to exceed 
$3,000, equal to 30% of the costs paid or incurred for the purchase 
and installation of renewable energy resources or renewable energy resources 
conversion technology projects, as provided." This bill would only 
be effective for purchases made between January 1, 2009 and December 
31, 2016.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 534 focuses on 
alternative energy sources, as generated by wind and geothermal sources. 
This bill was introduced one day after SB 463, on February 27, and is 
basically a way to help property owners, who install wind turbines and 
geothermal pumps, from having to pay additional taxes for said additions. 
It would act as an update to the tax code, in the form of a tax levy. 
The description of the bill describes it as an amendment to the current 
tax code, which "would provide that the classification as 'newly 
constructed' for purposes of these constitutional provisions does 
not include the construction or addition... of a small wind turbine 
or geothermal heat pump system." If approved, this bill would affect 
all related additions through December 31, 2009, but not after (unless 
renewed).</p>
<p>Senate Bill 542 is another 
interesting one for those interested in alternative energies, and receiving 
breaks. This bill would change the Public Resources Code, by directing 
the Public Utilities Commission to expand its use of solar energy and 
other efficient energy sources, and providing that energy to consumers 
without significantly raising prices. The bill would give the Public 
Utilities Commission until July 1 of 2010 to "develop and implement 
a strategy to expand the participation of multiunit residential and 
commercial rental properties in utility energy efficiency and solar 
energy programs" without "result[ing] in additional ratepayer surcharges," 
funding the solar energy initiatives through programs currently in place 
(ostensibly through the California Solar Initiative, and possibly other 
unnamed, related programs). The goal of this bill would be to "make 
energy efficiency and solar investments cost effective for utility customers 
in multiunit commercial and residential rental properties."</p><p>Now, how to implement all of this without heavily raising taxes...is an entirely different question all together.</p><p> </p>
