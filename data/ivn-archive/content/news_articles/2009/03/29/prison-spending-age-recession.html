<p>Those who
love irony will appreciate recent developments in California's prison system.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prisons25-2009mar25,0,2055747.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">A
federal judge refused</a> to take the state out from under the thumb of a
receiver who wants officials to spend $8 billion to build seven prison health
centers and renovate several others.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2008-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">The state's auditor</a>
released a review of last year's budget that showed revenues increased only 1
percent, the smallest growth since 2001, while government spending grew 8.2
percent.</p>

<p>Though
education spending showed one of the biggest general-fund increases -- $1.8
billion -- over the 2007-08 budget year, that funding was cut midyear from
levels approved when the spending plan was passed.</p>

<p>Prisons,
however, grew over both the previous year and over projections, showing an $884
million increase over the previous year.</p>

<p>And
that's not all. In addition to spending from the general fund, lawmakers
approved $7.3 billion in lease-revenue bonds for projects that included
state prison and local jail beds and health-care facilities, the audit report
said.</p>

<p>The
reason, according to the audit: "The increased expenditures in
correctional programs was mainly for inmate medical services, in order to
comply with recent court orders and implementation of new parole programs to
reduce recidivism."</p>

<p>The
prison general-fund budget grew by the $396 million over the budgeted amount,
nearly identical to the amount schools were cut. That means liberals might well
have a point when they claim government gladly will spend money to incarcerate
people but not to educate them.</p>

<p>Didn't
Rand Corp. warn long ago that <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB4009/index1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the
three strikes law would cost the state</a> $4.5 billion to $6.5 billion a year?
We're at $10 billion and counting.</p>

<p>And while
the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office didn't come up with a price tag in
its <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/2005/3_strikes/3_strikes_102005.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">2005
report,</a> it did warn that the increased numbers of prisoners as a result of
the three-strikes law, as well as the aging prison population in general, would
mean increased operating and building costs for the California corrections
system.</p>

<p>Except in
this case, California
is anything but glad about spending the money.</p>

<p>Attorney
General Jerry Brown and Schwarzenegger Administration officials were in court
again Tuesday, trying to convince U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson to end
the court's involvement in prison health care. </p>

<p>Henderson
refused, saying he wasn't convinced the state would continue the improvements
if the receiver were removed.</p>

<p>The state
plans to appeal.</p>

<p>"California is spending
almost $14,000 per inmate for health care  per year, far more than any
other state," Brown told <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>. "It is time for a
dose of fiscal common-sense."</p>

<p>Henderson did at least leave
wiggle room on the pricey construction plan, <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1726379.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">according
to <i>The Sacramento Bee</i>,</a> saying that he hadn't ordered construction, but only
renovations and plans for construction. And a three-judge panel that includes Henderson tentatively has
ordered the state <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_11985419" rel="noopener noreferrer">to
release about a third of its prisoners</a>, and fewer prisoners obviously would
mean less health-care needs.</p>

<p>Clearly,
there's no room for continued spending growth anywhere in California's budget,
with the state already facing a new $8 billion budget gap in the bloody
compromise struck just last month.</p>

<p>Inflexible
budget, meet inflexible judge. And inflexible voters who refused a little more
than four years ago to ease up on three strikes. The LAO estimates that had
Proposition 66 passed, it would have saved the state hundreds of millions
annually.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_strikes_law" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed that change</a>,
saying it would put 26,000 dangerous criminals back on the streets.</p>

<p>In the
final irony in this saga, that's about how many people <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prisons10-2009feb10,0,815133.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">California
would have to release a yea</a>r if the judges order cuts to the prison
population.</p>
