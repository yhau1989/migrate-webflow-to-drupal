<p>Looks
like actual bipartisanship can be a liability of epic proportions -- at
least, when you implicitly concede to the other party's agenda while
simultaneously directly contradicting a strategy aimed at retrieving
your own party's political capital so that you can escape the albatross
of an unpopular public official. </p><p>Which is, you know, totally <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/10/powell_obama_endorsement_under.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">unprecedented</a>. </p><p>But more importantly, being a genuinely bipartisan Republican is especially dangerous, and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> has given us one more reason to believe that. The <i>Times</i> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-recall22-2009mar22,0,4935804.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>
that the six Republican legislators infamously known as the "Sacramento
Six" who crossed party lines and voted for the tax-raising,
spending-cutting, lottery-borrowing budget are now facing "backlash
from conservative activists and regular voters alike."<br>
<br>This is an apt reaction from those voters - especially the
so-called "conservative activists." Bipartisanship has a bad name among
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OrDo0K3VFc" rel="noopener noreferrer">conservative luminaries</a>,
and rightfully so. Whenever the word is used as a rhetorical device by
one political party, it is almost inevitably a tacit threat to
steamroller the other if they don't roll over and play dead. </p><p>Given the
recent Democratic (and by extension, liberal) dominance, it's no
surprise that conservative activists are upset that their legislators
caved to this rhetorical bludgeoning device. It also doesn't help that
the national infrastructure of the conservative movement has been
gleefully turning California into a test case for every single one of
its ideas about the problems of state interference, and so far that
strategy has been all too accurate. </p><p>The cover of the March 9th issue of
<i>National Review</i> features Schwarzenegger as a screaming baby with the
caption "Girly man Ruins State" (a diagnosis whose crudity is only
matched by its accuracy), while supposed unofficial leader of the
Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh, has been cheering California's
Republicans <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_021709/content/01125107.member.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">for not giving in on the budget</a>. <br>
<br>Now, there is no doubt that California's conservatives have a list
of grievances with California's government which, if it were ever put on
paper, would probably be long enough to mummify the planet Earth.
California and, more importantly Governor Schwarzenegger, have been a
popular target for conservative pundits ever since the former became
defined by its association with San Francisco and since the latter <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/Site_032007/content/032007.member.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold out</a>
to the Left. </p><p>Moreover, the conservative movement has a firmer grip on
California politics than most of California's bluer citizens would like
to admit. After all, President Ronald Reagan was governor of California
in a previous life, and to some extent, his influence has lingered on.<br>
<br>But all that said, it is worth asking whether conservative
activists have picked the right target at the moment, where their
political capital is concerned. In the short term, the answer is
obviously yes. After all, California's citizens are mostly hopping mad
at the budget, and most, if not all of them can find something to
object to in the Leviathan bill. </p><p>By recalling the Republican
legislators responsible for this debacle, California's conservatives
would send a clear message that deviance from the ideological line will
not be tolerated because it is definitionally wrong. This would also be
good practice for conservative activists in dealing with other <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeasing legislators</a>
who are often liabilities to the movement's cause. It could also allow
the movement to effectively discard any baggage left over from the
budget once the storm hits, rather the same way it is currently
embroiled in discarding the detritus from Bush. <br>
<br>All of these would be persuasive arguments, if the movement could
count on a fair hearing in California. But as is painfully obvious
given the state's blue leaning, that is most often not the case. The
budget is not out of the woods yet, since Schwarzenegger apparently
still wants to waste the state's money on more special elections, and
so if it goes down in flames along with the legislators who supported
it, that opens the way for Democratic operatives to attack the
conservative movement (as they have been for a while) as the party of
"no." </p><p>Given their voting patterns, California's people will be
all-too-ready to listen to anything, <i>anything</i> but blame for
their profligacy, and will be all-too-happy to tar those goshdarn
tax-cutting heartless people who hate the poor, rather than take a hard
look at their own fiscally irresponsible impulses.  <br>
<br>True, most of California doesn't listen to Rush, but with the right strategy, one hopes they will listen to reason.
