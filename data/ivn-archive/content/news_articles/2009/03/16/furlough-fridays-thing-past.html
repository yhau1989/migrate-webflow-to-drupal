<p>Friday, March 
6 marked the last mandatory furlough day for tens of thousands of state 
workers in California, according to the Sacramento Bee and MarketWatch. 
Now, the next time Californians walk into a state office, such as the 
DMV, on a Friday, it most likely will not be closed.</p>
<p>Before the legislature passed the latest budget, Gov. Schwarzenegger threatened various 
actions to alleviate impending budget problems. After issuing an Executive 
Order instructing more than 200,000 state employees to take two unpaid vacation 
days, the governor was met with a hew and cry, but workers were forced 
to take off the furlough days. </p><p>It was hoped that the two unpaid days 
would save around $1 billion in expenses which otherwise would have 
to be paid by the state government, which is currently running a deficit 
of about $40 billion.</p><p> The furloughs lasted from February 6 to March 6,  on the first Friday and the third Friday of the 
month. The experiment only lasted for one 
month, incidentally, and may have been worth more as a scare tactic 
(to scare the legislature into passing a budget) than as a feasible, 
cost-saving opportunity.</p>
<p>After the brief experiment 
of sorts, it has now been determined by the governor that instead of 
mandatory unpaid vacation days on Friday, all state workers will still 
have to take off two days of work per month, but those days simply do 
not have to be specific Fridays. The new directive promotes the individual 
"self-directed" selection of furlough days. And like a snowflake, 
it is surely assumed that each worker's selection will be new and 
original.</p>
<p>Perhaps the change of heart 
had something to do with the recent announcement that California will 
probably receive somewhere around $50 billion from the federal stimulus 
bill, (as judged by the California 
Budget Project). It also appears this change is coming at least partially 
as a result of union displeasure. </p><p>The change is still subject to an 
agreement between both the unions fighting the furloughs and the California 
legislature. The order issuing the furlough instructions is set to extend 
for another 15 months, through to June 2010. </p><p>There have been ongoing 
negotiations with a number of state employee unions in California. At 
the outset, at least two unions threatened to strike if forced to take 
the unpaid vacation days. Currently, Schwarzenegger is said 
to be in talks with one of the sizable state unions, the Service Employees 
International Union Local 1000, to change the amount of furlough days 
per month from two days to only one day.</p>
<p>Executive Order S-16-08 was 
issued on December 19, 2008 and ordered that "effective February 1, 
2009 through June 30, 2010, the Department of Personnel Administration 
shall adopt a plan to implement a furlough of represented state employees 
and supervisors for two days per month, regardless of funding source.  
This plan shall include a limited exemption process." Remember again, 
the official reason behind the furlough was to reduce spending and "immediately 
improve the State's ability to meet its obligations to pay for essential 
services of the State."</p><p>
This was one of a number of 
measures designed to start saving money as the state coffers drew emptier 
and the state had already "halt[ed] lending money for an estimated 
2,000 infrastructure projects as a result of the cash crisis." Other 
threats looming included the state giving out IOUs rather than checks, 
and the possibly closure of the state government, if there was not enough 
money to run the system. </p><p>On Februrary 20, Schwarzenegger signed 
the budget, which was at long last agreed to by the California Legislature. 
Perhaps the true purpose of the furlough program was to shock some Californians 
into realizing the depth and magnitude of the state's debt, as many, 
particularly in the representative government, did not appear to understand 
the importance of agreeing to a solid budget and plotting out a future 
path. Before his tenure as the state's highest executive, Schwarzenegger 
was a professional entertainer, and was well-versed in shocking his 
audiences and keeping up the adrenaline. Well played, sir, well played.</p><p> </p>
