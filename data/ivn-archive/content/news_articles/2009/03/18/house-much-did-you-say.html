<p>Don't believe the naysayers 
who pooh-pooh the idea that the The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan will only help a small fraction of California homeowners: 
the data on that is not even readily available. However, the median 
home price in California a year ago was under $600,000. </p><p>Under the federal 
plan, those who owe less than or equal to $729,750 on their first mortgage, 
and are suffering financial problems on a mortgage secured by or before 
January 1, 2009, are basically eligible. Does it make sense that in 
a state with a median home value well under $729,750, only a small fraction 
of homeowners would benefit? Didn't think so. Let's take a look 
at some of the facets of the mortgage news of today, and see if the 
federal relief programs will actually help Californians.</p>
<p>The Homeowner Affordability 
and Stability Plan signed into law by President Obama stipulated that 
some homeowners could borrow more than 100 percent on the value of their homes, 
to up to 105 percent. According to CNN, more than 27 percent of homeowners are "underwater," 
or owe more for their home, than the price at which the home was actually 
valued. The loan modification program is geared toward those homeowners. </p><p>
The objective of this plan is "to provide creditworthy borrowers who 
have shown a commitment to paying their mortgage with affordable payments 
that are sustainable for the life of the loan." In his March 7 radio 
address, Gov. Schwarzenegger stated that in California, 
"new data shows more than 136,000 loan modifications occurred throughout 
California in 2008," though there still remains "the threat of foreclosure 
[which] still looms over thousands of California families and risks 
our economic recovery."</p>
<p>According to the White House blog, "Eligible loans will now include those where the new first mortgage 
(including any refinancing costs) will not exceed 105% of the current 
market value of the property. For example, if your property is worth 
$200,000 but you owe $210,000 or less you may qualify.  The current value 
of your property will be determined after you apply to refinance." 
Under the plan, the renegotiated mortgages will last a "30 or 15 year 
term with a fixed interest rate."</p>
<p>Some early reports have questioned 
how helpful this loan program actually could be. Those who owe significantly 
more than the loan they took out, are classified as being "underwater" 
in debt-terminology.  It may appear that with home value decreasing 
in California, such a proposal should benefit the majority; however, 
this mortgage modification program refers to the prices at which homes 
were bought, many of which were purchased when home prices were significantly 
higher than their current value. </p><p>Some of these same borrowers (at the 
present time, the date is not widely available) may well accrue well 
more than 5 percent of additional debt above the loans first secured. Welcome 
to the bloated and overpriced housing market of California.</p>
<p>According to the FDIC, the 
Treasury will be spending "up to $50 billion dollars to make mortgage 
payments affordable and sustainable for middle-income American families 
that are at risk of foreclosure. Borrowers who are delinquent on the 
mortgage for their primary residence and borrowers who, due to a loss 
of income or increase in expenses, are struggling to keep their payments 
current may be eligible for a loan modification." The FDIC statement 
further went to acknowledge a partnership with the Treasury, HUD and 
"other federal agencies" to get the "massive program" officially 
running by March 4.</p>
<p>Visiting <a href="http://financialstability.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FinancialStability.gov</a>, 
the visitor is presented with an offer of snake-oil salesman quality, 
encouraging homeowners to peek in, and find out if the new bill and 
loan modification plan will help them:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can no longer afford 
to make your monthly loan payments, either because your interest rate 
has increased or you have less income or you are experiencing a hardship 
that has increased your expenses (like medical bills), you may qualify 
for a loan modification to make your monthly mortgage payment more affordable. 
Millions of borrowers who are current, but having difficulty making 
their payments and borrowers who have already missed one or more payments 
may be eligible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Visitors are asked to consider 
four questions to find out if they are qualified for a "Home Affordable 
Modification":</p>
<ol><li>"Is your home 
  your primary residence?</li><li>Is the amount you 
  owe on your first mortgage equal to or less than $729,750?</li><li>Are you having trouble 
  paying your mortgage? For example, have you had a significant increase 
  in your mortgage payment <b>OR</b> reduction in your income since you 
  got your current loan <b>OR</b> have you suffered a hardship that has 
  increased your expenses (like medical bills)? </li><li>Did you get your 
  current mortgage before January 1, 2009?"</li></ol><p> </p>
<p>The lucky visitor who answers 
yes to all of the above, is invited to click a beckoning green button 
to find out more. Entering, visitors are instructed to pull out the 
necessary documentation, then "call your mortgage servicer and ask 
to be considered for a Home Affordable Modification. The number is on 
your monthly mortgage bill or coupon book."</p>
<p>(Does anyone feel bad for the 
mortgage companies being told what to? Don't. According to the Treasury, 
those who comply and succeed, will "receive an up-front fee of $1,000 
for each eligible modification meeting guidelines established under 
this initiative.<i> </i>They will also receive 'pay for success' 
fees -- awarded monthly as long as the borrower stays current on the 
loan -- of up to $1,000 each year for three years.")</p>
<p>Funny thing is, there is finally 
some transparency, but it is found only after a nice, long search. On 
the FinancialStability.gov website, those homeowners who must click 
the foreboding "other options" button are finally treated to a clear 
answer: No, "the plan will not help everyone." That's right, you 
heard it here: the universal bailout, paid for by taxpayers, is not 
in fact, designed to help all of the same taxpayers. If that wasn't 
juicy enough, the statement goes on to explain that the plan "is not 
designed to reduce mortgage balances for borrowers who have sufficient 
income to make their mortgage payments but owe more than their homes 
are worth. It also will not help investor borrowers or borrowers who 
have no income and cannot make any mortgage payment."</p>
<p>According to the Treasury, 
the reasoning behind the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan 
is threefold: 1.) To refinance up to 4 - 5 million "responsible 
homeowners to make their mortgages more affordable;" 2.) To provide 
a "$75 billion homeowner stability initiative to reach up to 3 - 
4 million at-risk homeowners;" 3.) To support lowered mortgage rates 
by "strengthening confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac." The 
Treasury also alleges in its support of the bill, that "each foreclosed 
home reduces nearby property values by as much as 9 percent." Supporting 
examples were not available. And the controversial possibility of allowing 
judges to reinvent history by changing mortgage deals, is still on the 
table with this plan.</p>
<p>Many Californians purchased 
homes before the housing bubble burst, at which point the median home 
price was well over $500,000, nearly $600,000. However, that is still 
less than $729,750. According to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
California has been working to battle mortgages woes in a number of 
ways, including a "voluntary agreement with major lenders to freeze 
interest rates for homeowners most at-risk to foreclosure."</p>
<p>And just some of the prerequisites 
to qualifying for the loan modification include having a home debt of 
less than or equal to $729,750 or less (which, interestingly, is now 
the standard rate as applied for extremely affluent areas, though previous 
applied maximum caps nestled closer to $400,000), and having a mortgage 
payment exceeding 31 percent of monthly income. </p><p>By the way, some of those disqualified 
from the loan re-finagling include those who lost their jobs, those 
who invested in homes in which they do not live (kind of shutting the 
door on investing, eh?) and those who owe mortgages above threshold 
of $729,750, also known as "Loan Limits for Conventional Mortgages." 
As provided by eFannieMae, 2008's loan limits ran, for a single-family 
home, from about $415,000 to over $600,000, though those limits were 
later "temporarily" raised to the new limits of today.</p>
<p>This will exclude those who 
purchased homes in areas in which there is, or at one point was, a high 
demand and extremely high housing prices. The California housing market 
still contains some of the highest-priced homes in the country. According 
to DQ real estate news, within one year, from January 2008 - January 
2009, the median price of a home in the Bay Area dropped to just under 
$300,000 from a previous high of about $550,000. CAR, in a recent news 
release, also noted that the average price of "an existing home" 
fell by 40.5%, to the median price of $254,350. This, in tandem with 
the news of California's housing market semi-rally in January with 
the reported selling of over 600,000 homes which was 100.8 percent higher 
than it had been one year before.</p>
<p>Say you bought a home and took 
out a mortgage a few years ago, of over $800,000, just so you could 
buy that middle-sized home in the excellent school district: you don't 
quality for this program. In Southern California, there was just as 
dramatic of a shift, with a one-year drop of just over $400,000 as the 
median home price, to about $250,000. Those who purchased homes in areas 
such as Santa Barbara, which the CAR has variously listed as one of 
the most expensive cities in which to live (with a median home price 
closer to $1,000,000 than the statewide average of about half that amount) 
are not exactly the target audience of the new mortgage relief programs. 
Then again, if someone was able to purchase such a home, they most likely 
have the assets to secure such a home already.</p>
<p>Between the dangers of the 
inflated and unadjusted Alternative Minimum Tax (as indexed according 
to property tax rates) and a federal stimulus plan that may help less 
than 10 percent of mortgage holders in California (according to the LA Times), 
the state housing market has yet to change significantly for the better 
at this point of mid-March 2009, though the bottom may not be far away; 
the signs are there, but not all of the pieces of the puzzle are in 
place yet.</p><p>
Commissioner Davi of the California 
Department of Real Estate has noted that, "On some fronts, we have 
turned the corner. Many of the issues that caused the crisis have abated, 
either by market corrections or regulatory efforts. DRE investigations 
revealed that stated income loans were used in the majority of cases 
that involved fraud. Such loans have all but disappeared from the market 
place." </p><p>The CA Department of Real Estate has already prepared an "Advanced 
Fee Agreement" template, for the purpose of facilitating "shortened 
loan modification services." Even if some Californians remain ineligible 
to benefit off of the loan modification program, the state and new programs 
are still offering rather generous assistance to those who can stand 
to reap the benefits.</p><p> </p>
