<p>In 1996, Californians passed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_215_%281996%29" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Proposition 
215</span></a> , which made it possible to 
possess, cultivate and use marijuana with a doctor's note. Medical 
marijuana dispensaries grew in number, and more patients utilized their 
services, but not without fear of Drug Enforcement Agency Raids -- a reality 
stretching into <a href="http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2009/01/steve-kubby-first-obama-dea-raid-in-california-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>this 
year</span></a>. Recently,
patients have been offered consolation that medical marijuana usage 
is being protected, and that the stigmas surrounding it -- for medical 
purposes and otherwise -- are on a path to eradication. <br>
 <br>
On February 27, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that the Drug 
Enforcement Agency would <a rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29433708/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>stop 
raiding</span></a> medical marijuana 
dispensaries in the 13 states--California included--where they are legal.  
This followed San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano's proposal for the  
Marijuana Control, Regulation and Education Act--better known simply 
as <a rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Control,_Regulation,_and_Education_Act" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>California 
Assembly Bill 390</span></a> --which 
would effectively legalize the sale and use of marijuana by anyone over 
the age of 21 in California. <br>
 <br>
These landmark decisions and proposals signify the closure of a 13-year struggle 
over two previous presidential administrations which took stances against medical marijuana, despite what individual 
states ruled. Soon after voters voiced their preferences on Prop. 215, 
the Clinton administration fought the law, winning a Supreme Court case 
that granted the federal government power to shut down any non-profit 
organizations that supplied medical marijuana. The administration also 
unsuccessfully attempted to punish California doctors that recommended 
medical marijuana to patients. <br>
 <br>
Under the Bush administration, federal agents began raiding medical marijuana dispensaries 
and growers, using drug laws to persecute suppliers. DEA officials have 
even written to dispensaries' landlords threatening to forfeit their 
property unless they give their tenants the boot. Bush may have been 
a proponent of states' rights, but only when they fit his agenda: During 
this time, the administration was successful in shutting down 30 dispensaries 
that were legal under state law. <br>
 <br>
Now, Holder's announcement marks a partial victory for California --  the full one which lies in the complete legalization of marijuana. Patients 
may be able to use medical marijuana with more ease now, but it is not 
until its full legalization that their use, and its acceptance, can 
become widespread. Many cities in California still do not allow dispensaries. <br>
 <br>
As some skeptics say, maybe that's for a good reason. Still, the Institute 
of Medicine, run by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has concluded 
that while marijuana is by no means a cure for any disease, it can curb nausea, 
pain, anxiety and appetite loss. While studies are inconclusive (maybe 
because the Bush administration did everything it could to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/medmarijuana/38300prs20090112.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>block FDA-approved research</span></a>), no adverse side effects have been proven 
from moderate use. <br>
 <br>
California already has more than 120 legal <a href="http://www.americanmarijuana.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>medical marijuana dispensaries</span></a>, 31 which are in Ammiano's city of San Francisco. 
In addition to aiding patients, these would help the money-lacking Golden 
State considering that Ammiano's proposal includes a $50 per ounce tax. 
When dispensaries don't have to recoup the costs of DEA raids, perhaps 
they will even have more to spend on supplies for what will be a likely 
increasing clientele. As an added bonus, any money raised from taxation 
will -- as the title of the bill connotes -- support drug education and 
awareness. <br>
 <br>
A recent CBS News/New York Times poll unveiled that 41 percent of Americans 
favor legalization. While that's not quite a majority, it shows that 
the times are a-changing, as the numbers were at 34 percent in a 2002 
CNN/Time Poll. <br>
 <br>
With the current wave of government actions and proposals, those numbers 
stand to increase even more in the future. Now is the ideal time -- under 
a new, more lax administration and a concrete, logically constructed 
proposal -- for California to stake its course again as a progressive 
leader and trendsetter. Especially with the passage of California Assembly 
Bill 390, California can eradicate the taboo from responsible marijuana 
use, and benefit users and the state in the process.</p>
