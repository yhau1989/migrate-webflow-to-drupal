<p>Now that California's embarrassing budget
spectacle is thankfully over, it is reassuring that many of the Golden
State's elected officials and opinion leaders seem to be on the same
page about one thing -- doing away with the state Constitution-required
two-thirds majority vote to approve budgets containing tax increases.</p><p>

 For more than 100 days -- California, the 8th
economic power in the world -- was held hostage by a small handful of
Republicans who vowed not to vote for any budget plan that
contained tax increases. 


 They took this position knowing that in order to
close the gaping $42 billion deficit they eventually would be put in
the proverbial cat bird seat to provide the constitutionally-required
two-thirds majority to pass any budget package.


 </p><p>Unfortunately, most of these ideologues held
their destructive ground. Fortunately, however, after some last-minute
deal-making, three GOPers from the Senate and three from the Assembly
crossed party lines and voted for the package, ending the standoff.


 </p><p>But now that the deal is done, it is good to know
that getting rid of this onerous state constitutional amendment,
created in 1933 and reaffirmed by Prop. 13 in 1978, is high on many
agendas.


 </p><p>"In
Sacramento, it's not majority rule, but minority rule. We've tied
ourselves in knots with the two-thirds rule, so it's time to go back
and move to a simple majority rule for everything," Lt. Gov. John
Garamendi said this week as reported by the <i><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/02/25/MN2G164CBA.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>.</i></p><p>


 Mind you, this is not about partisan posturing. 

 No, getting rid of this requirement simply means a return to
common sense that essentially would be good for any party that's in
power -- Republicans and Democrats alike.

 Moreover, it's about restoring fairness to the budget process.
How is it acceptable to anyone to have the Legislature's voting <i>minority</i> hold extraordinary power and authority over the voting <i>majority</i>?


 Short answer: It's not.

</p><p>Restoring the voting requirement to a rational and simple majority
(50 percent, plus 1) or even 55 percent assures the public that state
lawmakers won't be able to approve something as important as a state
budget or a tax increase on a whim.</p><p>In
the coming weeks you may well be stopped at the grocery store or mall
and asked to sign a petition to qualify a ballot proposition that puts
the question of doing away with the two-thirds requirement before all
Californians. It deserves a minute or two of your serious consideration.</p><p>While many would think such a ballot measure would cruise to an easy victory, history says otherwise. In
2004, Prop. 56, also known as the Budget Accountability Act, received
only 34.3 percent of the vote suffering from well-funded conservative
opposition and an overall low voter turn-out. This time
around, such an initiative, which will likely qualify for the ballot
later this year or early next, deserves to be passed. After all, it
would be downright anti-democratic (and, mind you, that's the small 'd'
kind) to do otherwise.</p><p>
