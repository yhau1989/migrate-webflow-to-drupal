<p><b>Her turn</b>: When we met, I thought he was
smart, fun-loving and charming. He charmed me with his go, go, go attitude.
Now, I'm not so sure. We fight all the time over finances. I want to stabilize
the budget by cutting back, but all he wants to do is spend, spend, spend.</p>

<p><b>His turn:</b> She's never been as flashy as I
am, but that's part of what attracted me to her. She's dependable, solid.
Lately, though, she's at my throat about everything. She says I don't
understand her world, and I do try, but she just seems so closed-minded.</p>

<p><b>Counselor:</b> How long has this been going on?</p>

<p><b>Both:</b> Since 1864. We filed for divorce
then, but Congress wouldn't let us.</p>

<p>Thus
begins the news installment of "Can California Be Saved?" The latest
edition is brought to you by a former Republican assemblyman from Visalia. </p>

<p>According
to <i>The Sacramento Bee</i>, under Bill Maze's plan 13 coastal counties from Los Angeles to Marin
would split from the remaining 45 counties. Maze has established a nonprofit
group called <a href="http://www.downsizeca.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizens for Saving California Farming
Industries</a> to push the idea.</p>

<p>"We're
looking at establishing a breakaway state," <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1653963.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">he
told The <i>Bee</i></a>, with a new government and a new capital. "We'd actually
be creating a 51st state."</p>

<p>The
November passage of Proposition 2, which banned certain types of animal cages,
spurred the group to start the latest succession effort. Except technically,
it's not a succession effort since the group wants to keep the name "California" and
evict the other 13 counties.</p>

<p>Maze is
even offering to take on the state's $45 billion debt, since the 45 breakaway
counties are more conservative. "I bet they these people will say, 'We
take the debt,' and will pay it off in two or three years," <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/article/20090212/NEWS01/902120331" rel="noopener noreferrer">he
told the <i>Visalia Times-Delta</i></a>.</p>

<p>The group
makes liberal use -- that might be a poor choice of words given its leanings --
of a comment it attributes to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that "the state
is ungovernable."</p>

<p>They're
probably right about that, but for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>California is
nigh unto ungovernable because of its ridiculous requirement that budgets be
approved by a <a href="/article/issues/2009/1/23/amend-budget-voting-requirement" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-thirds
majority</a>. </p>

<p>The state
is in financial chaos because of an initiative system that makes it easy for
virtually any pet project to appear on the ballot regardless of whether there's
money to pay for it -- and because voters approve the projects without worrying
about where the money will come from.</p>

<p>The state
is at political loggerheads because of gerrymanders designed to preserve the <a href="/article/issues/2009/1/28/lesson-learned-failure-prop-77" rel="noopener noreferrer">partisan
status quo of 1991</a>, the year legislative and congressional lines were last
redrawn.</p>

<p>The state
is a fiscal mess because of structural deficit of billions of dollars annually
that officials have known about for years but refused to address.</p>

<p>The state
lacks government leaders in part because of a system of term limits that throws
them out just as they're becoming skilled at working within the system.</p>

<p>And none
of that has anything to do with urban versus rural, farm versus city. </p>

<p>While the
idea of a new state is intriguing on some levels - it would be interesting
academically and intellectually to see what framers could come up with if they
blew up all the old assumptions -- it's not going to happen.</p>

<p>Wouldn't
it be nice if organizers would invest their time and money into working out solutions
instead of trying to start divorce proceedings?</p>
