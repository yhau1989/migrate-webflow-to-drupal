<p>California has had a rollercoaster 
of a water cycle this year. </p><p>Nine months ago, the state officially entered 
a drought period. On February 27, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger officially 
declared a state of emergency, and instructed the government to assist 
citizens in the water situation at hand. </p><p>In a statement, the governor, 
recognizing that despite an abundance of rain in recent days, "California 
faces its third consecutive year of drought and we must prepare for 
the worst -- a fourth, fifth or even sixth year of drought.... Last year 
we experienced the driest spring and summer on record and storage in 
the state's reservoir system is near historic lows. This drought is 
having a devastating impact on our people, our communities, our economy 
and our environment -- making today's action absolutely necessary. 
This is a crisis, just as severe as an earthquake or raging wildfire, 
and we must treat it with the same urgency by upgrading California's 
water infrastructure to ensure a clean and reliable water supply for 
our growing state."</p>
<p>Using the power to declare 
a state of emergency, the state's chief executive officer ordered 
every state government agency to "utilize and employ state personnel, 
equipment and facilities for the performance of any and all activities 
consistent with the direction of the California Emergency Management 
Agency (CalEMA) and the State Emergency Plan."</p>
<p>To map out the plan, 21 different 
courses of action were outlined by the governor in his emergency proclamation. 
Most of the directives encouraged various forms of water conservation 
programs and water awareness. Some of the directives included:</p>
<ul><li>"All urban water 
  users immediately increase their water conservation activities in an 
  effort to reduce their individual water use by 20 percent"</li></ul><ul><li>The statewide launch 
  of a water conservation campaign, led by the California Department of 
  Water Resources, which was also directed to "implement the relevant 
  mitigation measures identified in the Environmental Water Account Environmental 
  Impact Report" and to develop further "mitigation measures related 
  to air quality impacts."</li></ul><ul><li>The State Water 
  Resources Control Board was ordered to "expedite" water-related 
  transfers, while also adhering to strict environmental regulations. </li></ul><ul><li>"To the extent 
  allowed by applicable law," the governor directed state agencies to 
  work to "prioritize and streamline" the processes of water conservation, 
  desalination and "recycling projects that provide drought relief."</li></ul><ul><li>A new moratorium 
  will be set on "all new landscaping projects at state facilities and 
  on state highways and roads except those that use water efficient irrigation, 
  drought tolerant plants or non-irrigation erosion control." [These 
  same water-saving sprinkler systems are widely available for private 
  and commercial use already.]Water suppliers 
  within the state must have back-up pans in case they run short on water, 
  in accordance with California Water Code's section 10632.</li></ul><ul><li>The Department of 
  Water Resources has also been directed to offer all kinds of assistance 
  to water suppliers/districts and those working in agriculture, to help 
  implement water-saving strategies to "get the greatest benefit from 
  available water supplies."</li></ul><ul><li>Joint action will 
  be taken with state agencies and the Federal Drought Action Team to 
  provide for drought preparedness and "response activities."</li></ul><ul><li>Emergency exemptions, 
  including the suspension of Water Code section 13247, will be analyzed 
  by the Secretary for the California EPA and the Secretary of the California 
  Natural Resources Agency.</li></ul><ul><li>By the end of March, 
  if the situation has not changed for the better, the governor will "consider 
  issuing additional orders, which may include... [the] institution of 
  mandatory water rationing and mandatory reductions in water use; [the] 
  reoperation of major reservoirs in the state to minimize the impacts 
  of the drought; additional regulatory relief or permit streamlining 
  as allowed under the Emergency Services Act and other actions necessary 
  to prevent, remedy or mitigate the effects of the extreme drought conditions."</li></ul><p>What does this mean for the 
average citizen?</p>
<p> On first glance, it may appear, not much. </p><p>However, 
in less than one month's time, if there has been no visible change 
in the current and precarious water situation in California, the typical 
consumer may be hit directly. If drastic measures are deemed necessary, 
private citizens may have to face higher water prices, and less readily 
available water. That translates to paying more, and using less, of 
a most vital resource. </p><p>Southern California's Metropolitan Water District 
keeps a running update on its current water reserves, which at this 
point, are at less than half, or less than 2.25 million acre feet of 
water. </p><p>Last month, the California Department of Water Resources released 
its own statement on the water crisis: "California is facing the most 
significant water crisis in its history. After experiencing two years 
of drought and the driest spring in recorded history, water reserves 
are extremely low.... Many communities in the state are now reaching 
the limits of their supply. Aggressive water conservation can help stretch 
available supplies to meet demands. DWR is actively moving forward with 
water conservation programs to enhance these programs and provide state 
funding." </p><p>The Water Bank program is another government program that 
was set up to purchase and stock water from outlets willing and able 
to sustain such water sales, as a response to a judge's order barring 
unrestrained Southern California water purchasing from the San Joaquin 
Valley and Sacramento areas. And in a recent study, the National Weather 
Service found that from February through the spring month, throughout 
the majority of California, droughts are expected to "persist or intensify." 
How to best combat this rising tide? Water conservation.</p>
<p>However, the overarching message 
of the governor's proclamation is that water conservation is the key. 
The directive ordered, numerous times, for various state, federal and 
local agencies to jump into water conservation, and educate others about 
the need for water conservation as well. Interestingly, some of the 
abovementioned strategies, including the use of water-efficient irrigation 
(or weather-based irrigation controllers, as they are sometimes referred 
to) and the use of drought-tolerant plants, are strategies already widely 
touted by many water districts across California. </p><p>Many of the same water 
districts, including the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California 
(one of the largest water providers in the state), offer many rebates 
to consumers who purchase water-saving devices such as "smart" sprinkler 
controllers, efficient toilets and efficient washing machines, some 
of which can cover half or more of the item's price.</p>
<p>Facing a budget deficit of 
over $40 billion, to be "fixed" by raising billions of dollars in 
taxes, the last thing Californians need is the prospect of even more 
price hikes, and on water, no less.</p>
