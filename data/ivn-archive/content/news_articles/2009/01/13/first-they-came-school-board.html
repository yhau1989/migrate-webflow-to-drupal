<p>The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-groveland10-2009jan10,0,4757696.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>
that recently, in response to the firing of a popular math teacher, San
Francisco voters have attempted to recall not just one or two members
of the local school board, but the entire school board. It may be the
first time that such a large recall measure has been put forward, and
certainly bespeaks the tense air of the moment, which makes the phrase
"winter of discontent" look positively optimistic.<br>

<br>
Ordinarily, a small election like this wouldn't have much relevance
on a statewide basis, but at a time when California's politicians are
looking so pitifully unprepared to deal with the budget crisis, this
bit of overzealous recall spirit should send chills down the spine of
Sacramento. <i>Especially</i> the Republicans, whose admittedly obstructionist tactics have been provoking angry demands for recall elections <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/28/EDHJ14C6AI.DTL" rel="noopener noreferrer">since the end of November</a>.
Then again, the Democrats have much to worry about as well, since the
<i>Los Angeles Times</i> has recently been putting forward panicked editorials
about the Democratic willingness to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-transit12-2009jan12,0,4337031.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut transportation funds</a>. <br>

<br>
And then there's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-ed-budget9-2009jan09,0,1980046.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>
- a vicious ultimatum printed in the editorial page of a major
newspaper. An ultimatum which has been described as "bizarre" by <a href="http://calitics.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=7820" rel="noopener noreferrer">some commentators</a> and which, like the school board recall effort, is thoroughly original. In a blistering editorial, the <i>Times</i>
proposes the following conditions to Sacramento: "How's this for a
ballot initiative: If we don't get one by June 15, we show our elected
officials the door." The editorial describes a proposal put forward by
one Brad Morisoli for a ballot initiative which would <i>end the term of every elected official in Sacramento</i>
on June 15 if no budget compromise has been passed. Ordinarily, a
proposition like this would be exiled by most "respectable" news
sources to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infowars.com%2F&amp;ei=hbxrSau5L4KqsAOI_PXmCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgVUma4gSDU0jcEBI4k2NZIohYWw&amp;sig2=04RAzGfYrryhQpU2mRj8SQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">abyss of irrelevance</a>, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth. But the fact that the <i>Times</i>
has picked it up and run with it shows that there may be a real danger
posed to the Sacramento establishment, and that at last the politics of
obstruction and interest-juggling might be getting a well-deserved kick.<br>

<br>
Now, as most long-time readers of this website know, I am <a href="../../article/proposition-11/2008/11/4/saving-people-themselves" rel="noopener noreferrer">no friend</a> <a href="../../article/taxes/2009/1/3/two-months-midnight" rel="noopener noreferrer">of direct democracy</a>.
And there is certainly room for criticism of this ballot measure on the
grounds that it is an exemplary instance of democratic overreach. Some
have even protested that the measure is an insult to California's Legislature because <a href="http://calitics.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=7820" rel="noopener noreferrer">politicians are not children</a>.
At any other time, the warning to be wary of a barn-storming peasantry
would be quite well-merited. If politicians were acting with even a
speck more dignity, their honor as adults and politically engaged
instruments of compromise and balance would be worth defending.
However, at a time when taxpayers get slips that say "<a href="../../links/taxes/2009/1/2/california-taxpayers-due-refunds-may-get-ious" rel="noopener noreferrer">we'll pay, we promise</a>," Left-wingers start trotting out accusations about <a href="../../article/issues/2009/1/12/black-and-blue" rel="noopener noreferrer">half-century old campaign tactics</a> rather than dealing with problems and Republicans <a href="../../article/taxes/2009/1/8/taxing-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer">seem determined to shoot themselves in the foot</a>, I have only one thing to say: citizens of California, <i>oil your pitchforks</i>. </p>
