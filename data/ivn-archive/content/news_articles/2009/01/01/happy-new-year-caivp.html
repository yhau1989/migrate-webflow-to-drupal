<p>The California <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> wishes everyone a safe and happy new year. On this New Year's Day, we pledge to continue our pursuit of exceptional analysis from both sides of the political spectrum on all things politics in this great state.</p>

<p>With 2008 behind us, let us look forward to a bright future and work together to make those hours of great adversity that made up the end of last year a distant memory.</p>

<p>Happy New Year California!</p>
