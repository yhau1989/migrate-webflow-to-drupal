[advertisement title="" type="outset"]He’s the guy named Rand who launched his campaign at the <p><a href="http://www.galthouse.com/?_vsrefdom=galthouse-ppc&amp;gclid=CLTk-N314sQCFRSIfgodYpgAsQ&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galt House Hotel</a>.</p>

<p>He’s not named after Ayn Rand, says his father. And the Galt House is named after Dr. W.C. Galt, not John, says the hotel’s website.</p>

<p>But, he does have a strong libertarian streak.</p>

<p><strong>Rand Paul</strong> is an eye doctor from Kentucky, who didn’t intend on running for Senate until his father’s supporters drafted him to run in 2010&nbsp;to replace the longtime Republican from Kentucky, Jim Bunning.</p>

<p>Rand caught the interest of <strong>Ron Paul</strong>’s rabid rebel rousers as the younger Paul showed up to stump for his father’s dark horse campaign. He was also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZYs4cNVKqs" rel="noopener noreferrer">keynote speaker</a> at Faneuil Hall on December 16, 2007, for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKZmIzEMUN8" rel="noopener noreferrer">very first modern Tea Party</a>. On that day, Rand helped raise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMBc6C1VUTE" rel="noopener noreferrer">$6.5 million</a> in a single day for his father, the only anti-war, anti-Patriot Act, pro-civil liberties candidate on the Republican stage.</p>

<p>After being drafted to run for the Senate, Rand Paul wowed the political establishment relatively quickly by <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/primaries/kentucky" rel="noopener noreferrer">demolishing his opponent</a>, the insiders’ favorite and then Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, in what was cleverly coined a “Rand Slide” victory.</p>

<p>So what has he done since he took office just 5 years ago?</p>

<p>Besides making the liberty-loving hardliners throw up when he does anti-Ron things like vote for oversees spending or signs a letter to the Iranian president alongside a bunch of "pro-war against anyone except Israel" Republicans, he has given a middle finger to the rest of the establishment by doing things like:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/03/07/rand-pauls-filibuster-re-claiming-his-fathers-tea-party-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filibustering the nomination of John Brennan</a> for CIA director;</p>
<p>2. Filing a successful <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/12/rand-paul-files-suit-against-obama-nsa-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit against the NSA</a> for its mass surveillance program; and</p>
<p>3. Teaming up with Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to address <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/11/unlikely-alliance-cory-booker-rand-paul-push-criminal-justice-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voting rights for ex-felons</a>, the use of police powers in urban communities, and <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/03/10/rand-paul-and-corey-booker-push-historic-bill-to-legalize-medical-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">medical marijuana reform</a>.</p>
<p>In doing so, Rand has also taken some more traditional Republican positions, winning over the Republican base voters who wouldn’t dare vote for dad:</p>
<p>1. He’s teetered on the edge of <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/204235-paul-science-behind-climate-change-not-conclusive" rel="noopener noreferrer">denying man-made climate change</a>;</p>
<p>2. He’s says&nbsp;that the First Amendment keeps the&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2015/03/27/only-on-brody-file-video-rand-paul-says-its-time.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">government out of religion</a>, but not vice versa.</p>
<p>3. He’s <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/25/will-rand-pauls-stance-immigration-reform-hurt-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed immigration reforms</a>; and</p>
<p>4. He <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RandPaul/posts/10152416051106107" rel="noopener noreferrer">hates Obamacare</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, he has reached back into his libertarian pocketbook on a few issues that might cause moderate Republicans concern, like:</p>
<p>1. He supports the right to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/rand-paul-vaccines-114845.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOT have your kids vaccinated</a>;</p>
<p>2. He wants to <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/02/20/rand-paul-considers-adding-audit-fed-bill-debt-ceiling-increase/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audit the Federal Reserve</a>, or better, End the Fed; and</p>
<p>3. He wants to <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/11/18/rand-paul-last-week-i-want-to-end-the-wa" rel="noopener noreferrer">end the drug war</a>.</p>
<p>Rand has also authored a few books of his own, including:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Tea-Party-Goes-Washington/dp/1455503118" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Tea Party Goes to Washington</em></a></p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Government-Bullies-Everyday-Americans-Imprisoned/dp/1455522759/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428373601&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Government+Bullies%3A+How+Everyday+Americans+Are+Being+Harassed%2C+Abused%2C+and+Imprisoned+by+the+Feds" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Government Bullies: How Everyday Americans Are Being Harassed, Abused, and Imprisoned by the Feds</em></a></p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Taking-Stand-Partisan-Politics-America/dp/1455549568/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428373633&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Taking+a+Stand%3A+Moving+Beyond+Partisan+Politics+to+Unite+America" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America</em></a></p>
<p>In short, Rand Paul is an amalgamation of libertarianism, conservatism, and independence.</p>

<p>And like him or not, his candidacy has to be taken seriously.</p>
