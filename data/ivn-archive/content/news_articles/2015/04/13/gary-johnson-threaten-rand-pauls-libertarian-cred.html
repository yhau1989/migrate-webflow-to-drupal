<p>The media is&nbsp;obsessed with&nbsp;<strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> -- especially now that she has officially <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched her 2016 presidential campaign</a>. Unlike <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/2015/04/07/rand-paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ted Cruz</strong>, and soon <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, Clinton didn't host a big event or make a major speech at a carefully&nbsp;chosen venue with a name that the candidate wants to be associated with -- like <em>Liberty</em> University or the <em>Galt</em> House Hotel or <em>Freedom</em> Tower.&nbsp;No, Clinton made her announcement in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uY7gLZDmn4&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-minute video</a> on social media, claiming she will be the champion for everyday Americans.</p>

<p>However, another potential presidential candidate indicated that he is planning another run for the White House; yet,&nbsp;very few media outlets are talking about it.&nbsp;The Daily Caller reported late last week that former New Mexico Governor <strong>Gary Johnson</strong>, who was the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate in 2012, said he is going to run again unless something "catastrophic happens." Johnson is currently focused on a lawsuit that would open presidential debates to third-party candidates, but during his interview with The Daily Caller, he did weigh in on one current presidential candidate.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Asked about the libertarian-leaning Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s entrance into the race this week, Johnson said: “I like the fact that he’s running. I mean of all the Republicans, he’s the closest to my ideology. The things that we differ are immigration, marriage equality, women’s right to choose, drug policy and military intervention.”</em>

&nbsp;

<em>But Johnson said of Paul: “He has to pander to the right to get the nomination. And it’s a process where Republicans right now are putting out candidates I think are unelectable in a general election.”</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Johnson also disputed the characterization that Rand Paul is a libertarian. “Out of his own mouth, he in no way would describe himself as a libertarian,” Johnson said. “Because that is something he is running from right now to get the Republican nomination.”" - The Daily Caller</em></blockquote>
