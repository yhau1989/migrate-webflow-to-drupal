<h3>Who would you vote for if the 2016 Presidential Election were held today?</h3>
<p>Ahh ... it's&nbsp;time for another presidential election already, and voters are either passionate or apathetic once again!</p>

<p>To date, three candidates have entered the presidential race: Hillary Clinton, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz. If the election were held today, who would YOU vote for?</p>

<p>To help, here's some campaign videos of today's limited trio. The names are listed in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>But if you're a conspiracy theorist, it's because we secretly support Hillary Clinton and thought that was an excuse. Or ... if you're a conspiracy statistician, it's because people usually scroll to the last entry, and we secretly want Ted Cruz (No idea if that is true).</p>
