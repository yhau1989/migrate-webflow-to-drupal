<p>A New Jersey grand jury indicted the senior senator from New Jersey on Wednesday. Democrat Bob Menendez is the subject of an ongoing federal investigation regarding whether he improperly advocated on behalf of a private business. If Menendez were to step down, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie would appoint someone to take his place, which would likely widen the Republican majority in the Senate.</p>

<p>Menendez was re-elected in 2012 and ran unopposed in the state's closed partisan primary.</p>
<blockquote>Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted on corruption charges Wednesday, accused of using his office to improperly benefit a Florida eye doctor and political donor.

&nbsp;

The indictment charged the New Jersey Democrat with 14 counts, including bribery and conspiracy, over his ties to Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy doctor and the politician's longtime friend.

&nbsp;

Melgen also was charged in the case.

&nbsp;

The indictment from a grand jury in New Jersey was the latest development in a federal investigation that came into public view when federal authorities raided Melgen's medical offices two years ago. The investigation focused on whether the senator had improperly advocated on Melgen's behalf, including by intervening in a Medicare billing dispute.</blockquote>
