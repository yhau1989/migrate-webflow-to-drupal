<p>This week, the Washington Post published an analysis of Georgia's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/04/27/the-most-amazing-political-stat-youll-see-this-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gerrymandering</a> problem. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gerrymandering/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerrymandering</a></strong> is the practice of manipulating electoral boundaries&nbsp;to favor one political party or dilute the voting power of specific voting blocs.</p>

<p>Georgia's redistricting process is overseen by its&nbsp;legislature, a common theme among states with a history of uncompetitive elections.</p>

<p>In addition to a surprising lack of competition in the 2014 elections, the Washington Post found:</p>
<blockquote><em>"But really, it's not that surprising. In the state Senate, where there are precisely zero crossover districts, the most Democrat-friendly district held by Republicans went more than seven points (53 percent to 46 percent) for Mitt Romney, and the most Republican-friendly district held by Democrats went nearly 17 points for Obama (!), 58 percent to 41 percent.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>In other words, there is no state Senate district that went between 46 percent and 57 percent for Obama. There are really no swing districts, per se."</em> - The Fix, April 27, 2015</blockquote>

<p>Of over 200 incumbent legislators up for re-election in the state, less than 5 percent came within 5 percentage points of losing their re-election, and only one&nbsp;incumbent, Democratic U.S.&nbsp;Rep. John J. Barrow, actually lost.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/02/23/6-states-consider-adopting-independent-redistricting-groups/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bill</a> that would move the state toward adopting an <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/independent-redistricting-commissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent redistricting commission</a></strong> was put forward in January, but has made little progress since. Independent redistricting commissions, though not completely immune from partisan influence, are considered by most to be a practical alternative. These&nbsp;'independent' commissions are usually comprised of non-legislators from both parties as well as one or more nonpartisan members. In some instances, the state auditor selects potential commission members&nbsp;from a pool of applicants and then the legislature selects the final members.</p>

<p>Whether or not independent redistricting commissions like those in California and Arizona will be <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/12/02/do-independent-redistricting-commissions-pass-constitutional-muster/" rel="noopener noreferrer">constitutional</a> for much longer is set to be decided by the Supreme Court in the summer.</p>
