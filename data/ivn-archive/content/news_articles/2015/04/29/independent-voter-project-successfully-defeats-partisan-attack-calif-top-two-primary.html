[advertisement title="" type="outset"]<p><strong>CALIFORNIA</strong> -- On Wednesday, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the case, <em><a href="http://ivn.us/2015/03/31/parties-continue-challenge-calif-nonpartisan-top-two-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rubin v. Padilla</a></em>, a third-party challenge to the state's nonpartisan, top-two open primary. Third parties&nbsp;claim that the new primary system violates their right to be on the general election ballot.</p>

<p>On January 29, the California Court of Appeal in San Francisco affirmed a lower court's decision to dismiss the case, acknowledging that the&nbsp;right third parties have to fair and equal treatment in the election process is satisfied&nbsp;"by participation in an open nonpartisan primary election in which every candidate has an equal opportunity, regardless of party affiliation, to advance to the general election."</p>

<p>The only option the&nbsp;plaintiffs&nbsp;have now is&nbsp;to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the high court has denied previous petitions to review essentially the same question, meaning it would be a long shot for the plaintiffs to go this route.</p>

<p>If the plaintiffs&nbsp;choose to seek review from the high court, they have 90 days to file their petition.</p>
