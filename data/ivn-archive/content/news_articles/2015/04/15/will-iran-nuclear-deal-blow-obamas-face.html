[advertisement title="" type="outset"]For weeks, Iran's nuclear negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Congress, and the continuous sparring over the P5+1 deal dominated the news.

<p>While the deal seems to still be "on," developments throughout the P5+1 seem to be shaking the core of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/iran/framework-p51-joint-comprehensive-plan-action-irans-nuclear-program/p36376" rel="noopener noreferrer">the agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Primarily, the issue is&nbsp;the competing and -- at times -- incompatible nature of&nbsp;the&nbsp;foreign policy and economic goals of the P5+1 nations. If that wasn't enough, there is the political game being played on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>In the U.S., a <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/iran-bill-bipartisan-deal-bob-corker-116958.html?hp=t3_r" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan bill</a> unanimously cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 14 that&nbsp;would forbid President Obama from removing any legislative sanctions against Iran until the Senate can review, and potentially reject, the agreement.</p>

<p>Cautiously, the&nbsp;EU nations renewed sanctions against 32 Iranian companies and government institutions on April 7 until Iran shows significant progress. However, Russia, this week, shifted&nbsp;far to the other extreme.</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://rt.com/news/249229-russia-s300-delivery-iran/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia Today</a> and the Israeli newspaper,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.651740" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haaretz</a>, extensively covered Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to give the go-ahead to sell $800 million worth of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22652131" rel="noopener noreferrer">S-300 missile</a> hardware to Iran.</p>

<p>This deal has been in the works since 2010, but was put on hold because of U.N. sanctions against Iran, which the Russian government honored. However,&nbsp;the cash-strapped Russian economy likely affected&nbsp;Putin's willingness to continue upholding sanctions.</p>

<p>While Russia Today portrayed this as Russian 'business as usual' when it comes to worldwide armaments sales, Haaretz directly portrayed it&nbsp;as an immediate failure of the P5+1 agreement:</p>
<blockquote><em>"The S-300 deal we are hearing about now – in fact, the Russian renewal of the deal that was put on hold over the past several years – is a direct result of the framework agreements reached at Lausanne. This is something we warned about before the details were ironed out."</em> -- Israeli&nbsp;Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon</blockquote>
<p>While these missiles are defensive in nature, and probably wouldn't do much to improve&nbsp;Iran's perceived desire to arm itself with ICBMs, they would definitely strengthen Iran's strategic&nbsp;capabilities against airstrikes.</p>

<p>With Israel's continued threats of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/israel-warns-anew-action-against-iran-143501078.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">unilateral strikes</a> against Iran's nuclear production sites, improving air defense capabilities is a priority for the Iranian military.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="A normalized and internationally accepted Iranian Islamic Republic would greatly affect much of (Netanyahu's) political aims and platform." author="David Yee, IVN Independent Author"] Although this sale of armaments creates a moment of saber rattling, there has also been a&nbsp;moment of pause within the Israeli government. What if Iran actually complies with the agreement?

<p>Haaretz<em>&nbsp;</em>also reported two days earlier on the leaked details of an <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.651350" rel="noopener noreferrer">Israeli cabinet meeting</a>, during which Prime Minister Netanyahu suggested that&nbsp;Iranian compliance was&nbsp;his greatest fear.</p>

<p>This is not totally sour grapes politics from Netanyahu; but yes,&nbsp;a normalized and internationally accepted Iranian Islamic Republic would greatly affect much of his political aims and platform.</p>

<p>But the second part of his fear is that a compliant Iran will simply 'lull' the world into complacency, while Iran only puts off its ambitions for a decade.</p>

<p>This seems somewhat unlikely, however. The amount of human capital and material hardware that would change in a decade would undermine Iran's nuclear ambitions if they remained compliant to the P5+1 framework.</p>

<p>The two real questions that remain are whether Russia will remain faithful to the P5+1 framework and stop selling Iran the technology and materials needed to weaponize uranium, and whether or not the U.S. Senate will kill the deal at its first opportunity.</p>
