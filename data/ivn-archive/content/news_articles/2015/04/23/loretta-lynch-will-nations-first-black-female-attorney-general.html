<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Senate confirmed Loretta Lynch as the next U.S. attorney general in a 56-43 vote. The confirmation is historic as Lynch will be the first African-American woman to serve as America's chief law enforcement official.</p>

<p>The Hill reported Thursday on how the senators voted and possibly why:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Senators voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch, more than 160 days after she was first nominated for the position by President Obama.</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>Ten Republican senators broke ranks and sided with Democrats to get Lynch over the 50-vote threshold.</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Susan Collins (Maine), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mark Kirk (Ill.), Rob Portman (Ohio) Thad Cochran (Miss.), Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) all voted for Lynch."</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>Ayotte, Kirk, Portman, and Johnson are up for reelection in 2016."</em> - The Hill, April 23, 2015</blockquote>
<p>The Hill further reported that 2016 presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ted Cruz</strong></a>, who said he would oppose the confirmation of Lynch, didn't vote. He did, however, criticize McConnell and the GOP Senate leadership for allowing a vote.</p>
