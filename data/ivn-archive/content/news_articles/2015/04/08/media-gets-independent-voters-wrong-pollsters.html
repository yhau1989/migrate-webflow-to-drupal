<p>A newly released <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/://" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Center report </a>once again shows that Americans who self-identify as independent remain near the 40-percent mark, but at the same time perpetuates the long-held stereotype that independents still fall only along red or blue lines and will vote in predictable patterns.</p>

[outset]

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4-6-2015_01.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="4-6-2015_01" height="738" src="cloudinary://4-6-2015_01.png" width="309"></a></p>

[/outset]

<p>The essence of this particular chart highlights the common belief that the independent voter is really just a leaning Republican or Democratic voter who just doesn't want to label themselves as a party member -- or doesn't want to share their true political beliefs with pollsters.</p>

<p>By their numbers, only a very small percentage of independent voters fall outside the political ilk of the major parties.</p>

<p>And there's definitely a large kernel of truth to this. Both <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-29/straightticket-voting-rises-as-parties-polarize" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 and 2014</a> saw massive increases in straight-ticket voting, indicating an electorate that is becoming more polarized than ever.</p>

<p>Also, we just aren't seeing the number of successful independent campaigns we would expect to see if close to 40 percent of the electorate is truly independent.</p>

<p>Yet, countering all of this, we have hard data showing that voters are registering as independent or "no party preference" in record numbers.</p>

<p>For the 2014 midterm election, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-ca-voter-reg-20140923-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">23.1 percent of California's registered voters</a>&nbsp;chose to register themselves as "No Party Preference."</p>

<p>Similar patterns are being seen across the nation. In at least<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/19/8-states-party-registrations-lags-behind-independent-registration/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 8 states</a>, registered independents outnumber voters&nbsp;registered with&nbsp;the traditional parties.</p>

<p>How can both of these concepts -- that there is no such thing as a "real" independent and the growing number of registered independents -- be true at the same time?</p>

<p>It's not like registering as an independent is without cost to the voter. In most states, registered independents cannot participate in the two-party primary process that determines who is on the ballot in the general election.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a huge price to pay for someone who is supposedly just a "left/right leaning" voter.</p>

<p>So what's missing from this paradigm?</p>

<p>What's missing is the refusal of the major media outlets to accept what it means to be an independent. This is the dialog we should be having:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Being an independent means you can have political beliefs <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/11/04/americans-becoming-independent-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranging from conservative to liberal</a>, but;</li>
	<li>Being an independent means you are <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/10/22/50-reasons-register-independent/" rel="noopener noreferrer">not beholden to a party's platform</a>, agenda, cronyism, and/or endorsements.</li>
	<li>Being independent is a <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/12/13/independent-voter-network-ivn/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindset, not an ideology</a>.</li>
	<li>Being independent is the political flexibility to realize that there is <a href="http://ivn.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=23295632206&amp;action=edit&amp;message=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">no one perfect party, ideology, or platform</a>.</li>
	<li>Being independent is the belief that government <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/03/17/independent-voter-project-defends-nonpartisan-voting-rights-third-circuit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">represents the people</a>, not the organizational power of the political ilks of the politicians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, being independent in many&nbsp;states comes at a great cost: the inability to vote in an integral stage of&nbsp;the public election process; namely, the primary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as the independent movement gains strength and momentum nationwide, we will see that being independent isn't about being a leaning left/right voter... It's about changing the political system of the past hundred years that has created the entrenched, immutable partisanship we see in Washington today.</p>
