<p>Al Jazeera America reported Monday that a sizable portion of California's population does not have reliable access to fresh water because of high levels of arsenic in the soil. California is 4 years into a historic drought that now has forced over a million residents to spend as much as a tenth of their income just on bottled water.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Tap water that comes mostly from wells in these communities violated maximum contaminant level standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency at least once in 2012 – the most recent annual compliance report by&nbsp; the state’s drinking water program.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>The number of violations with potential direct public health impact may affect even more people because of insufficient regulation and under-reporting, especially in areas served by small systems, said Heather Lukacs, project director at the Community Water Center.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>More than 100 areas with fewer than 10,000 people had arsenic violations. Most are small, poor communities with a predominantly Hispanic population, some of whom are forced to spend up to 10 percent of household income on bottled water."</em> - Al Jazeera America, April 6, 2015</blockquote>
