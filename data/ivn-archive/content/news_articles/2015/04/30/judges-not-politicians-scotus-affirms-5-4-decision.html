<p><span>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state laws barring elected judges from directly asking for campaign donations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Judges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way of the ballot,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the decision, joining the court’s four liberal justices in a 5-4 decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-spureme-court-judges-campaign-money-20150429-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><span>The decision marks one of the few times the high court has rejected a free-speech claim involving politics and campaigning. Roberts split from the court's four conservative justices to uphold the Florida law.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UC Irvine, called the ruling a surprise.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>"This is a huge win for those who support reasonable limits on judicial elections. And getting Roberts on this side of the issue is surprising, welcome and momentous," he said.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>In California, things&nbsp;could get interesting. California is one of 39 states that&nbsp;elect judges. It is also among the 9 states that do not have restrictions on campaign fundraising. How California responds to the recent ruling in&nbsp;<em>Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar&nbsp;</em>will have major implications on judicial elections, and candidates will have to adapt&nbsp;accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span> [social_blockquote quote="17% of state supreme court justices in the U.S. are chosen in partisan elections." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295662444" handle="" hashes=""]While the decision comes as a victory for supporters of campaign finance reform, judicial elections are not shielded from the pervasive partisanship that has come to define our electoral process. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seven states still elect their supreme court justices in partisan elections, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Partisan_election_of_judges" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballotpedia cites</a>. Altogether, 58 state justices (18 in Texas alone) are elected using this method -- that's 17 percent of all 338 state supreme court justices across the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This means that in electing those who are tasked with the unbiased and rational&nbsp;interpretation of the law, political parties play a major role in 7 states.</p>
<p>“In partisan elections they have a leg up, as they already know the judge’s likely political philosophy,"&nbsp;Justice James Nelson of the Montana Supreme Court <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/civil-liberties/report/2012/10/25/42895/partisan-judicial-elections-and-the-distorting-influence-of-campaign-cash/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> of political parties and special interest groups.</p>
<p>While the recent SCOTUS decision is a step in the right direction, we still have a long way to go when it comes to making elections fairer.</p>
