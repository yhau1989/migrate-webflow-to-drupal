[advertisement title="" type="outset"]<p><strong>CALIFORNIA</strong> -- The upcoming special election in California's 7th Senate District will feature two Democrats as a result of the state's nonpartisan, top-two primary. Democrats <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/steve-glazer/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steve Glazer</strong></a> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/susan-bonilla/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Susan Bonilla</strong></a> took the top two spots in the March 17 primary election, with 33 percent and 24.9 percent of the vote, respectively.</p>

<p>Glazer is a former adviser to Governor Jerry Brown and mayor of Orinda. Assemblymember Bonilla, who has the Democratic Party's endorsement, has represented the 14th Assembly District since 2010 and is a former mayor of Concord.</p>

<p>To some, seeing two Democrats on the ballot means that neither candidate differs much from the other. However, this is not the case in Senate District 7.</p>

<p>Attack ad campaigns from the left have already gotten creative in an attempt to paint Steve Glazer out of the picture. During the primary race, a political action committee tried to mislead voters into thinking that Republican <strong>Micheala Hertle</strong> was still campaigning, even though she dropped out of the race weeks earlier and already endorsed Glazer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deceptive and negative ads usually discourage the average voter, but excite party-base voters. However, if Glazer manages to overcome a tide of PAC spending ahead of the May 19 election, it would signal a big shift in party politics.</p>

<p>Political commentators like Joel Fox from <em>Fox and Hounds Daily</em> agree:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Some would say that the attacks against Glazer over the course of the campaign are political business as usual – the kind of stuff that turns off casual observers to politics. Maybe that’s the point. Discourage the independent-minded voter from casting a vote because they are disgusted with the political invective.</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>However, should Glazer withstand the onslaught he would be a reliable Democratic vote in the legislature. But, he would also be a trailblazer – independent from most Democrats who gained their seats with heavy backing from the unions — and, perhaps, opening the door for others to follow the same path.</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>If such a transition comes to pass, Glazer’s election might eventually be talked about along with the election of early 20<sup>th</sup> century governor Hiram Johnson, who successfully broke the grip of the railroads on the California legislature."</em> - Joel Fox, Fox and Hounds Daily</blockquote>
