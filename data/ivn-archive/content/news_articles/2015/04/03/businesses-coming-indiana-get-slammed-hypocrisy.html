<p>The Washington Post created a video montage of some of the best late-night jokes surrounding the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was recently&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/04/02/indiana-governor-mike-pence-signs-revised-religious-freedom-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer">revised</a> by the Indiana Legislature and Governor Mike Pence to explicitly protect members of the LGBT community from discrimination.</p>

[advertisement title="" type="outset"]The jokes didn't just take aim at the state or its officials, but some of the responses to the bill as well.

<p>"The NCAA, Apple, and Yelp have all protested the law and have threatened not to expand their operations in Indiana," Seth Meyers said on NBC's<em> The Late Night Show with Seth Meyers</em>. "Also, Apple announced they're leaving China and the NCAA announced they're going to start paying student athletes... nah... I'm just f***ing with you."</p>

<p>Under Meyers' joke is a lingering truth about the hypocrisy that exists&nbsp;in&nbsp;such self-righteous statements from companies that do business in countries like China, where factory conditions are poor, or countries where being gay is actually illegal.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with company heads coming out against bills that opponents&nbsp;say could give some companies the legal justification for discriminating against members of the LGBT community or anyone.&nbsp;However, it comes off as a form of grandstanding because there is a level of hypocrisy to it, and there is no reason why these businesses should not be called out for this hypocrisy.</p>

<p>"When Tim Cook is upset about all the places that he does business because of the way they treat gays and women, he needs to withdraw from 90% of the markets that he's in, including China and Saudi Arabia," Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/carly-fiorina-bashes-tim-cook-for-religious-freedom-comment-2015-4#ixzz3WGk5bUSD" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently said</a>. "But I don't hear him being upset about that."</p>
