<p>At a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker highlighted the importance of securing the United States' northern border as well as the one to the south. While he questioned the Director of the All-Threat Intelligence Center, Bryan Costigan, Senator Booker said:</p>
<blockquote>"Everytime I hear, 'Secure the border' people seem to be talking about our southern border. I come in and I see a picture of Latinos crossing the river, and I wonder where's the picture of the Canadian border and the thousands and thousands of illegal crossings we have there."</blockquote>
