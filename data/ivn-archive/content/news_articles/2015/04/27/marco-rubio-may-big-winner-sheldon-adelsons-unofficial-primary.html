[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Over the weekend, several potential Republican presidential candidates met for a <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/us/politics/republican-contenders-reach-out-to-sheldon-adelson-palms-up.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">fundraiser in Las Vegas</a>, Nevada. One of the more noted attendees, casino owner <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong>, may be leaning toward supporting one of the GOP aspirants.</p>

<p>Adelson, whose net worth is estimated at more than $30 billion, <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/01/24/adelson-gingrich-and-the-selling-of-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> notoriety in 2012 when he reportedly donated <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/12/03/sheldon-adelson-ended-up-spending-150-million" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 million</a> to Republican candidates. When asked about wealthy benefactors contributing to the political process, Adelson <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/12/03/sheldon-adelson-ended-up-spending-150-million" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> in 2012, "I'm against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections," but since others do it, he said, "I'm going to do it."</p>

<p>While names such as George Soros and the Koch brothers <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/12/17/4-reasons-moderates-cant-win-elections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">appear frequently</a> as the bankrollers of American politics, Adelson's name is often mentioned as one of the big donors who can influence candidates on behalf of a foreign country through his lavish contributions. The billionaire is closely connected to&nbsp;Israel's Likud Party, owns a newspaper in Israel, and endorsed the claim that Palestinians are an "invented people."</p>

<p>Adelson&nbsp;has also publicly <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/billionaire-gingrich-backer-adelson-regrets-he-served-us-instead-israeli-military" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed</a> regret for serving in the United States army instead of the Israeli armed forces. Veteran PBS correspondent Mark Shields recently <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2015/04/shields-adelson-foreign" rel="noopener noreferrer">harangued Adelson</a> for "making foreign policy for the United States."</p>

<p>Last week, Politico reported that Florida U.S. Sen. <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> might have the inside track to gaining Adelson's financial support. Although not publicly stating his support for the senator, Adelson has called Rubio "<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-takes-lead-in-sheldon-adelson-primary-117268.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the future of the Republican Party</a>."</p>

<p>Hints that Adelson supports Rubio may also be directed by the billionaire's anger at <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> for his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/politics/jeb-bush-james-baker-foreign-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reluctance</a> to criticize family friend and longtime ally <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/james-baker-blasts-benjamin-netanyahu-116338.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Baker</a> III.</p>

<p>However, Adelson's support would&nbsp;not necessarily give Rubio&nbsp;an advantage in the GOP primary or the general election. Adelson donated an estimated <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/03/28/newt-gingrich-says-wealthy-donors-like-sheldon-adelson-have-too-much-influence/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 million</a> to Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign that produced only two statewide victories. Adelson also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-23/sheldon-adelson-s-bad-bets" rel="noopener noreferrer">invested</a> millions in U.S. Rep. Allen West's failed 2012 re-election bid as well as George Allen and Scott Brown's Senate losses.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether Rubio ultimately gains Adelson, the Florida senator is already <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/414958/rubio-snags-top-donor-ahead-2016-eliana-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer">connected</a> to at least one wealthy donor: Miami billionaire <strong>Norman Braman</strong>.</p>

<p>Like Adelson, Braman has antipathy for Rubio's presidential rival, Bush. In 2004, Governor Jeb Bush vetoed $2 million in state spending earmarked for Braman's cancer research institute. The billionaire <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-2016-campaign-norman-braman-117134.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> that while he has no personal animosity for Bush, he was "disappointed with the veto," which&nbsp;he says he was never given an explanation for.</p>
