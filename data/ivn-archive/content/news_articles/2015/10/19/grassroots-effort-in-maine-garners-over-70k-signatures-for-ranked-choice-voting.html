<p>Maine electoral reformers <a href="http://www.wmtw.com/news/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-deliver-signatures/35922636" rel="noopener noreferrer">delivered over 70,000 signatures</a>, mostly gathered by volunteers, to the Maine secretary of state on Monday in Augusta. The <a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Committee for Ranked Choice Voting</a>, a grassroots group of Maine citizens, has garnered broad support from across the political spectrum, all with a singular focus: uphold majority rule and give voters a stronger voice in elections.</p>

<p>The signatures move the citizens initiative for <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/instant-runoff-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a> (RCV, also called instant runoff voting) a big step closer to being on the ballot in November 2016, with prospective first use of RCV for all state and congressional primary and general elections in 2018. Speakers at the press conference making the case for RCV included Polly Ward with the League of Women Voters of Maine, former state senators Dick Woodbury (I) and Peter Mills (R), state representative Diane Russell (D), and deputy mayor of Brewer, Beverly Uhlenhake (D). The campaign also released <a href="https://youtu.be/yNwsjCos9eY" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a> on Monday describing the benefits of RCV in Maine.</p>

<p><em>Editor's note: FairVote<a href="http://www.fairvote.org/news/a-historic-day-for-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> originally reported</a> this news on the group's website on October 19, 2015, and has been modified slightly for publication on IVN.</em></p>
