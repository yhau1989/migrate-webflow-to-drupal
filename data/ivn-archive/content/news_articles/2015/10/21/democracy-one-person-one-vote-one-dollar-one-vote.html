<p>On Thursday, the <strong><a href="http://www.lwvsandiego.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">League of Women Voters of San Diego</a></strong> will host a panel discussion on the influence of money in politics.</p>

<p>The program is appropriately titled, <em>Is it One Person, One Vote or One Dollar, One Vote?&nbsp;</em>and features panelists <strong>David Loy</strong>, Legal Director at the ACLU of San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties, <strong>John Lawrence</strong>&nbsp;of the San Diego Free Press, and <strong>Michael Aguirre</strong>, former San Diego city attorney.</p>

<p>With the 2016 presidential&nbsp;campaigns in full force, candidates have already spent close to $100 million. These numbers do not even reflect the overwhelming contributions of corporations and private donors to super PACs and Independent Expenditure Committees.</p>
<h4>Some issues that the League has researched in the past include:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>The role of dark money in influencing our elections</li>
	<li>The role of the partisan regulatory board, the&nbsp;Federal Election Commission</li>
	<li>The impact of recent Supreme Court decisions on the amount corporations and wealthy individuals can donate to political campaigns.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The League has conducted substantial research on the topic which&nbsp;can find <a href="http://forum.lwv.org/category/member-resources/our-work/money-politics-review" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The event is on Thursday, October 22, 2015, at 11:30 am - 1:30 pm at Tom Hamâ€™s Lighthouse Restaurant. The <a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Independent Voter Project</strong></a>&nbsp;is co-sponsering the event.</p>
