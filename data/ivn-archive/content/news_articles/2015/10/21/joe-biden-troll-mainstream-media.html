[gravityform id="101" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]From CNN to The Hill, up until Wednesday, everyone was convinced Joe Biden was running for president. Alleged sources close to the vice president or a friend of a friend of a source at the local bar told reporters and political pundits in the mass media that Joe was a go.

<p>Instead, Joe said no.</p>

<p>So where was the disconnect? Everyone was sure Joe Biden was running. Did Joe Biden or his associates troll the mainstream media? Or was this simply a case of the knee-jerk, report now, substantiate later style journalism we have come to expect from the mass media? Did the media troll us?</p>

<p>Fox News chief White House correspondent Ed Henry tweeted Monday:</p>

<p>Sure, Henry added that the sources told him to exercise caution, but that didn't stop him from tweeting it out. Or Fox News and CNN reporting on it like it was a sure thing. Or other news outlets from picking it up. What mattered was that Henry was among the first to "break" the story.</p>

<p>Or how about this tweet from CNN's Dana Bash:</p>

<p>The only reason Joe Biden's announcement was such a "shock" as it is now being reported is because nearly everyone reported that his associates told them he was running without waiting to hear what Joe had to say.</p>

<p>"I've said all along what I've said time and again to others: that it may very well be that [the grieving] process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president: that it might close. I have concluded that it has closed," Joe Biden said during a press conference on Wednesday, October 21.</p>
<blockquote>"While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent. I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation."</blockquote>
<p>Just goes to show, nothing is official until it is official.</p>
