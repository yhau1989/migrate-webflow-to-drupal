<p>A bill proposed by&nbsp;Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) calls for a mandated 40-hour workweek for all members of Congress while they are in Washington.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/457" rel="noopener noreferrer">House Resolution 457</a> states that it seeks to amend <em>“the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that the House be in session at least 40 hours each week other than a week that is designated as a district work period.”</em></p>
<p>Jolly, who is running for the U.S. Senate in 2016,&nbsp;<a href="http://wfla.com/2015/10/05/bill-supports-40-hour-work-weeks-for-members-of-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he is sponsoring the bill because he sees a frustration among the public that Congress has not <em>“engaged in a legislative fight to begin to advance the agenda that is right for the American people.”</em></p>

[social_blockquote quote="Americans are sick and tired of Washington inaction." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295670197" handle="usrepdavidjolly" hashes=""]“Americans<p><em> are sick and tired of Washington inaction,”</em> Jolly said. <em>“They expect their leaders to govern. Look at all the bills gathering dust while Congress braces for the next self-made calamity. Let’s give voice to the people on issues like border security, transportation, a budget that finally balances.”</em></p>

<p>The Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/255974-gop-lawmaker-calls-for-40-hour-congressional-workweeks" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that during a typical workweek in Washington, <em>“House members come in Monday evenings for votes at 6:30 p.m. and depart for their districts by early afternoon Thursday,”</em> and then <em>“alternately, the House convenes on Tuesdays and remains in session until Friday.”</em></p>

<p>This proposal comes after Jolly <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/218533-freshman-lawmaker-calls-for-five-day-congressional-workweek" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> a letter to the&nbsp;House Rules Committee in Sept. 2014 calling for a similar change, and requesting that while in session, workweeks run <em>“from 8:00 a.m. on Monday until 6:00 p.m. on Friday.”</em></p>

<p>A press release on the bill <a href="http://wfla.com/2015/10/05/bill-supports-40-hour-work-weeks-for-members-of-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that over the last 20 years, while Congress has been in session for about 137 days each year, the typical American works&nbsp;40-hour, 5-day workweeks, and spends about 241 days at work each year.</p>

<p><em>“This ‘try-nothing’ Congress needs a reality check,”</em> Jolly said. <em>“A work week in Washington should be no different than a work week in every other town across the nation.”</em></p>
