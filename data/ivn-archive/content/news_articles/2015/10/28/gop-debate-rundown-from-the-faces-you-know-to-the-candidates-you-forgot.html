<p>Republican presidential candidates are gathering in Boulder, Colorado for the next GOP debate titled, "Your Money, Your Vote." The debate will air Wednesday, October 28, on CNBC at 8 pm ET. Similar to the first two debates, there will be a lower-tier debate at 6 pm ET.</p>

<p>The same candidates who participated in CNN's top tier debate will participate in the CNBC debate (minus Scott Walker), including:&nbsp;<strong>Donald Trump</strong>, <strong>Ben Carson</strong>, <strong>Jeb Bush</strong>, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>, <strong>Mike Huckabee</strong>, <strong>Rand Paul</strong>, <strong>Carly Fiorina</strong>, <strong>Chris Christie</strong>, and <strong>John Kasich</strong>.</p>

<p>The bottom tier debate will consist of&nbsp;<strong>Rick Santorum</strong>, <strong>Bobby Jindal</strong>, <strong>George Pataki</strong>, and <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong>.</p>

<p>Moderators for the Wednesday night debate include CNBC's Chief Washington correspondent, <strong>John Harwood,&nbsp;</strong>co-anchor of “Squawk on the Street” and “Squawk Alley,” <strong>Carl Quintanilla</strong>, and co-anchor of “Squawk Box,” <strong>Becky Quick</strong>.</p>

<p>This debate will focus on economic issues such as <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/taxes" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxes</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/retirement" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer">job growth</a>, and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/social-security" rel="noopener noreferrer">social security</a>. While most of the candidates hold similar conservative positions on these issues, there are differences in how each candidate has laid out their fiscal policies so far.</p>

<p>Small government, low taxation, and business deregulations are common ground among the GOP candidates, but they vary in extremity. For example, Ted Cruz argues that there is a clear dichotomy between the economics of Robin Hood and Adam Smith.</p>

<p>"Choice is more federal spending -- or free markets and liberty," he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Economic/Ted_Cruz_Budget_+_Economy.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a>.</p>

<p>Both Cruz and Huckabee have said they want to abolish the IRS.</p>

<p>Some of the GOP candidates disagree on if the government should bail out private industry. Jeb Bush argued that the 2007 bank bailout was necessary to prevent the "unraveling of the financial system," whereas Rand Paul <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Rand_Paul_Budget_+_Economy.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that government should never bail out private industries.</p>

<p>The candidates also take different approaches on other issues that question the nature of the relationship between government and business. Ben Carson <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Ben_Carson_Budget_+_Economy.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>&nbsp;that the deregulation of the financial industry in the 1990s led to the economic meltdown of 2007, which is contrary to the more conservative "hands off" approach coming from other candidates.</p>

<p>The contrasting viewpoints of the candidates will likely lead to comedic disagreements on the stage. Hopefully, it will also provide a chance to include a more detailed discussion of economic policies that the candidates haven't encountered in previous debates.</p>
