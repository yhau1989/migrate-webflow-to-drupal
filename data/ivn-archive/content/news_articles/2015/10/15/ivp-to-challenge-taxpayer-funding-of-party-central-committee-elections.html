<p>In light of recent court precedent that insulates political parties from any form of regulation by the state, the <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> (IVP) is challenging the&nbsp;public funding and administration of party central committee elections.</p>

<p>California state law provides that a county registrar shall conduct party central committee elections at the request of any qualified political party (see e.g., California Elections Code sections 7230 and 7425).</p>

<p>However, as the political parties have successfully argued in court, a party’s county central committee does not perform any governmental functions and membership in the committee is not a public office (see, <em>Wilson v. San Luis Obispo County Democratic Central Committee </em>175 Cal. App. 4th 489, 500 (2009), holding that California Election Code provisions that seek to govern the composition of a party central committee violate the First Amendment rights of political parties and their members).</p>

<p>The California Supreme Court has also held&nbsp;that taxpayer funds shall not be disbursed unless “a direct and substantial public purpose is served and non-state entities are benefited only as an incident to the public purpose." (<em>California Housing Finance Authority v. Elliot </em>17 Cal. 3d 575, 583 (1976).)</p>

<p>In light of this precedent, the Independent Voter Project is asking all county registrars to&nbsp;refrain from expending any public resources for the administration of party central committee elections unless each political party requesting such&nbsp;administration first agrees&nbsp;to reimburse taxpayers&nbsp;for the full and fair public costs related thereto.</p>
