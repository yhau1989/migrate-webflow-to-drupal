<p>We are creating a new series unlike anything streaming or on TV.</p>

<p>Award-winning journalist Ben Swann travels the globe on a quest to uncover personal stories of struggle and success from people who are working to advance the betterment of the human condition</p>

<p>This is Global Activist—a series about people who aren't waiting for the world to change.</p>

<p>There are uprisings, demonstrations and public calls to action happening this very moment that are underreported or completely ignored by institutionalized media—the People’s Liberation Army in China; the #BlackLivesMatter movement in the United States; the “pots and pans” revolution in Iceland; open carry activists in Texas; environmental protesters getting killed in Brazil; the protests for the 43 missing students in Mexico. In this series, Ben Swann and Jasmine Monroig give voice to activists from these movements and others, who are creating change in the NEW global protest movement.</p>

<p>Protests are only a small part of the activist movement building across the globe. Activism involves art, culture, organization, information and education. Styled after embedded journalism, we take you through a process of understanding how and why movements across the world are demanding reform and change from banking, government, policing and political powers.</p>

<p>We will reveal activist movements that are just beginning, others that have succeeded and still others that have failed. We delve into the background of these movements, the people who are organizing them and the protesters who are calling for change, as we explore what that change looks like.</p>
