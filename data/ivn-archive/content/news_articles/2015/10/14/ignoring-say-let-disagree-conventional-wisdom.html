<p>This morning, after a few minutes of online browsing, my girlfriend said to me – matter-of-factly over her cup of steaming coffee – that, "They say that Clinton won the debate last night."</p>

<p>I know why she said that, because I know that her go-to news source is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newser.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newser</a>, which aggregates and summarizes stories and analyses from around the web. She had just read the aptly titled, <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/214414/debate-seen-as-massive-win-for-clinton.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Debate Seen as Massive Win for Clinton"</a>&nbsp;– a round-up of the conventional wisdom as offered by outlets like the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>, the&nbsp;<em>New York Times,</em>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Politico</em>.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="If you're looking for evidence that (Hillary) won on the merit of her ideas, you won't find it in these mainstream publications." author="Andrew Gripp, IVN Independent Author"]I had read most of these individual opinion pieces already, and to say the least, I was unimpressed. Even mild scrutiny of these articles reveals that the authors rested their conclusions not on the substance of Clinton's remarks, but largely on the style of her delivery – her tone and her poise.

<p>Michael Barbaro and Amy Chozick of the&nbsp;<em>New York Times, </em>for instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?&amp;hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a>&nbsp;that Clinton, who had a "dominant performance," had "smiled and laughed regularly." Chris Cillizza of the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/winners-and-losers-from-the-1st-democratic-presidential-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">observed</a> that, "Clinton was confident, relaxed and good-natured" and "was head and shoulders above everyone else on the stage as a debater." Niall Stanage and Amie Parnes of&nbsp;<em>The Hill</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/256870-dem-debate-winners-and-losers" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarked</a> that Clinton was "polished and poised."</p>

<p>If you're looking for evidence that she won on the merit of her ideas, you won't find it in these mainstream publications. Incidentally, these are the criteria that they must use in their assessments: adjudicating who gave the best answers would be to risk appearing "biased," which could damage&nbsp;their credibility&nbsp;with their large and diverse readerships.</p>

<p>It is&nbsp;the superficiality&nbsp;of the&nbsp;conventional wisdom&nbsp;– what Christopher Hitchens once&nbsp;<a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?93435-1/state-media" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> as often being&nbsp;"a hundred miles wide and a millimeter deep"&nbsp;– that ought&nbsp;to leave readers wondering&nbsp;on what basis the public should believe that Clinton truly won the debate.</p>

<p>Indeed, what sustains the conventional wisdom is not any kind of wisdom <em>per se</em>, but rather mere <em>convention</em>:&nbsp;Clinton is roundly declared to have won because others have said she won. It is similar to the <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/d/danieljbo110687.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">logic</a> that drives celebrity culture, in which&nbsp;people are well known for being well known.</p>

<p>This is precisely why the Newser article title,<a href="http://www.newser.com/story/214414/debate-seen-as-massive-win-for-clinton.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">"</a>Debate Seen as Massive Win for Clinton," is so fitting, if not revealing. This is writing&nbsp;– and thinking&nbsp;– in the passive voice.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best encapsulation of how consensus opinion is generated and replicated comes from James Fenimore Cooper, who <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NkZQP-XUlwoC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=they+say+monarch+social+sense+cooper+american+democrat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bh8oq1Ea9G&amp;sig=BSXPhbxzJYmspXepmrT3lO6Pj-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI_9Cl3PjByAIVCRo-Ch2SpgCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=they%20say%20monarch%20social%20sense%20cooper%20american%20democrat&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>&nbsp;in 1835:</p>
<blockquote>"They say," is the monarch of this country, in a social sense. No one asks "<em>who</em> says it," so long as it is believed that "<em>they</em> say it." Designing men endeavor to persuade the public, that already "they say," what&nbsp;these designing men wish to be said, and the public is only too much disposed blindly to join in the cry of "they say."</blockquote>
<p>It is this insight that voters should keep in mind when they are bombarded by opinion polls that tell them which candidates or ideas are popular and are thus <a href="http://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow" rel="noopener noreferrer">considered politically viable</a>, as well as when they read mainstream publications that, however subliminally, attempt to <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/06/09/bias-media-just-not-liberal-bias/" rel="noopener noreferrer">steer public opinion</a> to support a particular candidate, issue, or mindset.</p>

<p>In order to inoculate one's self against this kind of groupthink, Cooper recommended that, "Every well meaning man, before he yields his faculties and intelligence to this sort of dictation, should first ask himself 'who' is 'they,' and on what authority 'they say' utters its mandates."</p>

<p>Most importantly, in addition to being skeptical of the flimsy basis of the conventional wisdom, voters should have confidence in their own ability to watch, listen, and read for themselves, to do their own research, and to form their own opinions – regardless of&nbsp;whether they align with the general consensus.</p>
