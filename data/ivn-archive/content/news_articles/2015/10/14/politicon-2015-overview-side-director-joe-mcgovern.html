<p><a href="http://politicon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politicon</a>, which was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center on October 9 and 10, was billed as a nonpartisan, comic-con style event for politics and entertainment. There were panels, debates, TV &amp; movie screenings, live radio and podcasts, comedy shows, Q&amp;A’s, book signings, interviews, art exhibitions, and music.</p>

<p>Trevor Noah was there. So was Newt Gingrich, James Carville, Ann Coulter, David Axelrod, Cenk Uygur from The Young Turks, Michelle Bachmann, Dennis Kucinich… They programmed the event like a music festival – with different events happening at the same time.</p>

<p>There wasn’t an official goal or aim for Politicon, at least not one that I could find, and they were careful to mention that it was not affiliated with any political organizations, parties, or PACS, and ticket sales did not support any political affiliations.</p>

<p>They scheduled a good mix of conservative and liberal speakers and panelists (the full lineup is still available <a href="http://politicon.com/lineup/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and it seemed like an interesting idea, so I took a break from editing my documentary, <a href="http://theothersidedocumentary.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Other Side: a liberal democrat explores conservative America</em></a>, to cover Politicon for IVN. I recently submitted "The Other Side" to the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
