<h4><strong>Source: John Finnerty, <a href="http://www.sharonherald.com/news/local_news/pa-s-closed-primaries-shut-out-young-independent-voters/article_34fb6460-64ce-11e5-a611-ebb8340c249f.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Herald</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: From a state calling out more and more for an open primary, a bit of in-depth reporting about the effect on young voters who are more than likely to register as independents.</p>

<h4><strong>Source: Burdett Loomis, <a href="http://www.hayspost.com/2015/09/24/insight-kansas-more-voters-better-representation/ " rel="noopener noreferrer">Hays Post</a></strong></h4>
<p>Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas, writes a piece challenging Kansas to increase voter turnout three ways.</p>

<p>My Take: &nbsp;Good rationale on these three, one of which is going to the top two nonpartisan primary where California is cited.</p>

<h4><strong>Source: Bob Perls, <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/649940/opinion/adopt-open-primaries-in-2016.html " rel="noopener noreferrer">Albuquerque Journal</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: Perls, a former NM Democratic state representative, is also the founder of New Mexico Open Primaries. He discusses issues relating to redistricting, voter registration, and voting -- and opening up the process to allow everyone to participate while at the same time reducing partisanship.</p>

<h4><strong>Source: Joe Hardenbrook, <a href="https://www.adn.com/article/20150924/power-people-alaska-should-return-open-primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alaska Dispatch News</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: This is a really good read. The history gets a little folksy in explaining Alaskans and why the closed primary is so unlike their nature but it flows really well. Great political background information about a state most of us in the “lower 48” know little about.</p>

Essmann Offers Rebuttal On Closed Primary Issue</a></h1>
<h4><strong>Sources: &nbsp;Former State Senator Jesse O’Hara/State Representative Jeff Essmann, The Montana Standard News</strong></h4>
<p>My Take: Another page from the on-going book that is the Montana GOP’s admitted effort to keep those not philosophically pure out of the party and legislature. An interesting comparative read. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>My Take: For people like me who wondered what the Independent Party stands for, this is an excellent read. Sal Peralta is the state Party Secretary and does an excellent job of making their case, while addressing issues that may very well challenge the party’s future.</p>

<h4><strong>Sources: &nbsp;Joe Mathews/Joel Fox, Fox &amp; Hounds</strong></h4>
<p>My Take: A really interesting read. Two well respected political writers who see the legislative results from very different points of view with both pointing to the nonpartisan, top-two primary in very thought provoking ways.</p>
