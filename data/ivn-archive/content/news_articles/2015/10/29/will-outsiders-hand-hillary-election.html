<p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/joe-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Biden</a></strong> will not run. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> not only survived the 11-hour Benghazi hearing, with many pundits claiming she looked “presidential,” while the Republicans ended up with yet more egg on their faces, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong>&nbsp;defended her&nbsp;in the first Democrat debate by saying that we need to stop talking about her "damn emails."</p>

<p>Shortly after, Hillary stabbed Bernie in the back, and now a new <a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/c83c0429-6c12-47a7-ac86-9bd1beab9bfb.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monmouth University Poll</a> has her leading in Iowa by a whopping 41 points. What is one to make of this?</p>

<p>It appears the Clinton campaign will do anything to cool the “bern” of Sanders’ surge, but they may not be the only ones intent on derailing his campaign.</p>

<p>Corporate interests have hedged their bets as usual, and given the topsy-turvy nature of the GOP race, Hillary Clinton is poised to become the darling of both major party establishments.</p>

<p>While the rise of <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ben-carson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Carson</a></strong> in the polls may not be uncommon at this stage of the game, their staying power must be making a lot of the traditional power brokers nervous. If that isn't enough to keep them awake at night, the Sanders surge is causing nightmares.</p>

<p>What’s an oligarch, accustomed to so easily manipulating the masses, to do? In this election cycle, it appears that even they may have to choose the lesser of evils, and it may very well be Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Although the Monmouth University Poll has been all but universally criticized for how its&nbsp;sample was framed (even the Clinton campaign has discounted it), it does raise the question of why such a poll would be conducted in the first place. Those who were not polled (young, independent, possibly first-time voters, or even voters who had previously lost interest) are the ones pollsters should be focusing on. There is a huge number of voters, on both the left and the right, sending the same message to politicos -- enough is enough.</p>

<p>Only time will tell what becomes of Trump and Carson, but if their possible future demise is perceived to have been orchestrated by the Republican Party establishment, those responsible better pray that Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.</p>
