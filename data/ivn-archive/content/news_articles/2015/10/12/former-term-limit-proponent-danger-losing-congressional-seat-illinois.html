<p>In Illinois, an incumbent will possibly be facing a serious primary challenger for the first time in his nearly twenty-year political career.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/09/08/one-time-term-limits-advocate-runs-11th-term-illinois/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> recently on&nbsp;IVN, Illinois U.S. Rep. John Shimkus of the 15th congressional district announced he was running for an eleventh term, further breaking a promise not to serve more than six.</p>

<p>Challenging Shimkus is State Sen. Kyle McCarter of Lebanon. Serving in Springfield since 2009, McCarter, whose term expires in 2018, is not running for re-election&nbsp;to his current seat,</p>

<p>In talking to Effingham's 97.7 FM, McCarter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZviYBD4qk" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "Washington is broken.&nbsp;And unfortunately, our representative is part of the problem."</p>
<blockquote>"When you make it a career, politicians are controlled by special interests. And what they do is not in the benefit of the people. And I don't know what happens to these people when they go up there. Somehow they drift.</blockquote>
<p>McCarter's theme of complacence in Washington continued when it came to the social issues Shimkus has long trumpeted.</p>

<p>"I didn't see the disgust. I didn't see the anger," McCarter said, referring to Shimkus' visible protest of Planned Parenthood, but which the congressman eventually&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1003623/roskam-hultgren-lahood-vote-stopgap-funding-measure-illinois-delegation-roll-call" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> to continue funding through the stopgap budget resolution.</p>

<p>In a reply to McCarter, who said he was in the process of <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-10-07/update-rauner-backing-shimkus-over-mccarter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving</a>, Shimkus <a href="http://herald-review.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/mccarter-to-challenge-shimkus-for-seat-in-congress/article_0f27af6b-1894-5235-a1af-73c1ae4e9f43.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> a statement:</p>
<blockquote>"Unlike my opponent, my family lives in the 15th district, and we never moved to Washington, and I am proud to be a public servant, from West Point to the Army to teaching to county government to Congress."</blockquote>
<p>McCarter currently resides <a href="http://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=62254&amp;Submit=FIND+YOUR+REP+BY+ZIP" rel="noopener noreferrer">near</a> the line between the 12th and 15th districts. The 12th, currently represented by freshman Republican <a href="http://ivn.us/search/Mike+Bost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Bost</a>, is normally more favorable to Democrats while the 15th was gerrymandered by Democrats in Springfield to be a large, single Republican district. The 15th <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/IL/15" rel="noopener noreferrer">covers</a> much of southern, southeastern, and east central Illinois and <a href="http://www.ibjonline.com/localheadlines/2921-mccarter-to-challenge-shimkus-for-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporates</a> at least parts of 33 of Illinois' 102 counties.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Washington is broken. And unfortunately, our representative is part of the problem." author="Ill. State Sen.Kyle McCarter"]Although Shimkus has support from the GOP at large - it was <p><a href="http://www.fox32chicago.com/politics/30977442-story" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> at President George W. Bush's request that Shimkus remain in Congress beyond a sixth term - 2016 is shaping up as an anti-incumbent year. The early polling success of Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, at least among Republicans, testifies to the impatience of voters with the political class.</p>

<p>Another aspect that may influence a potentially contentious primary is a report from a conservative scoring group that may hurt Shimkus among primary voters.</p>

<p>The Conservative Review, an <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/28/conservative-political-operatives-form-new-conservative-review-mega-scorecard-member-rating-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer">organization</a> started by political operatives Deneen Borelli and Daniel Horowitz, scores candidates on <a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/Issues" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a> ranging from the Second Amendment to Civil Liberties to Moral Issues and National Defense. As with nearly all&nbsp;of Illinois' Republican representatives, Shimkus <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2015/10/all-but-one-of-illinois-congress-members-fail-in-new-conservative-scorecard.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> an "F" from the group.</p>

<p>Although Shimkus' broken term limit promise usually comes up during his campaigns, the issue has hardly hurt him politically. In the general elections since his campaign promise was officially broken, Shimkus has usually <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/09/08/one-time-term-limits-advocate-runs-11th-term-illinois/" rel="noopener noreferrer">won</a> with 70% of the vote or more.</p>

<p>As a state senator, Kyle McCarter has more name <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/18/state-senator-kyle-mccarter-challenges-minority-leader/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recognition</a> than many other potential rivals, but his senate <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/VotingInformation/PDF/2011Districts/2011SenDist54.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">district</a> only envelops the western edge of the 15th. He will also contend with the inclination of&nbsp;most of Illinois' elected Republicans -- even term-limit proponents such as Gov. <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/09/03/in-illinois-bruce-rauner-runs-for-governor-on-term-limits-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Rauner</a>&nbsp;-- to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-10-07/update-rauner-backing-shimkus-over-mccarter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a> Shimkus.</p>

<p>Yet despite a probable fundraising gap with Shimkus, McCarter is confident he will accumulate enough to compete and give the people of the 15th district a voice.</p>

<p>"Because people are generous," he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZviYBD4qk" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a>, "and if they believe in the cause they're gonna give."</p>
