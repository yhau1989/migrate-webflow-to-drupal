<p>Gallup's recent move to back out of presidential primary polling raises certain questions surrounding whether public polling should or should not be used to determine who makes the presidential debate stage.</p>

<p>Since 2000, the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/commission-on-presidential-debates" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Commission on Presidential Debates</strong></a> (CPD) has used a 15 percent polling threshold for candidates to make the debate stage, a threshold that has been impossible for independent candidates to reach.&nbsp;The five polls, in which the CPD determines which&nbsp;candidates make it to the stage, are chosen by Dr. <strong>Frank Newport</strong>, Gallup's editor-in-chief.</p>

<p>However, Newport said Gallup will not conduct candidate polling during this presidential primary season and possibly refrain from polling in the general election as well. The announcement is a surprise to many because Newport recently testified in support of the CPD's use of polling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>"Public polling is by far the best method of measuring a candidate’s support among the electorate prior to Election Day. Polling involves a scientific process through which polling experts seek to determine, mathematically, the best estimate of the public sentiment on a particular topic at a specific point in time…The science of public polling is constantly evolving as the methodology continues to improve." - Frank Newport, Gallup</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry Enten, at Fivethirtyeight, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/gallup-gave-up-heres-why-that-sucks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> Gallup's exit from horse-race polling is bad for everyone. Gallup employed rigorous methods and had successful years despite recently experiencing <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/gallup-fixes-2016-106780?o=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">off-the-mark polls</a> during 2012, he explained.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Since other polling organizations ... are also moving away from horse-race polling, the CPD's&nbsp;options may be limited." author=""]

<p>However, the organization in the most precarious position may be the CPD.</p>

<p>The CPD promised to release its debate criteria a full year prior to the debates. That deadline has now passed and many Americans are asking for two things: 1) open up the debate process to include otherwise qualified non-major party candidates and 2) announce the debate criteria in a timely manner so these candidates can prepare.</p>

<p>With its chief pollster out, how will the CPD respond? Since other polling organizations like the Pew Research Center are also moving away from horse-race polling, the commission's options may be limited.</p>

<p>These recent events not only shed light on a flawed debate system, but they might be a catalyst for change. The CPD is in a tight situation and Gallup's exit from presidential polling might provide the opening voters and reform groups have been waiting for to open the debates to candidates outside the major parties.</p>
