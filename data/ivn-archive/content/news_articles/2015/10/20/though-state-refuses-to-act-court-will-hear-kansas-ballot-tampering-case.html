<p>IVN has been following the work of<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/08/06/questions-remain-in-alleged-kansas-vote-tampering-case/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=23295667065&amp;preview_nonce=ac2756d405" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dr. Beth Clarkson</a>, a Wichita State University engineer and statistician who claims that the 2014 Kansas senatorial race (among others) had suspicious trends that indicate tampering of the electronic voting machines.</p>

<p>Judge Douglas Roth allowed the case to continue into discovery on October 19, setting a trial date for <a href="http://ksnt.com/2015/10/19/voting-machine-lawsuit-moves-ahead/" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 22</a>.</p>

<p>This is a major victory for Clarkson and her <a href="http://showmethevotes.org/2015/09/02/its-too-much-trouble-to-show-me-the-votes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporters</a>, as state and county officials have stone-walled any efforts to check the paper records, deeming it "too much trouble" or "not lawful."</p>

<p>Dr. Clarkson's analysis of why the 2014 vote is suspicious, as well as her current updates, can be found at her personal <strong><a href="http://bethclarkson.com/?cat=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a></strong>.</p>
