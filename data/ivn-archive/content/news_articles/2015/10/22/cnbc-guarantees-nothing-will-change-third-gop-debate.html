<p>CNBC will host the third presidential debate on October 28, titled, "The Republican Presidential Debate: Your Money, Your Vote." Three debates in, the host and venue may have changed, but the faces on the stage will not. CNBC <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/21/cnbc-reveals-republican-presidential-debate-lineup.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed Wednesday</a> that 10 candidates met the 3 percent polling threshold (2.5% or higher, actually) to appear on the main stage, meaning that none of the top-tier candidates still running were eliminated.</p>

<p>"The results were based on methodically sound and recognized national polls conducted by NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN and Bloomberg," CNBC reports. "The candidates with an average of three percent in this specified group of national polls will take the stage shortly after 8PM ET for a two-hour debate."</p>

<p>If a candidate averaged at least 2.5 percent, it was rounded up to 3 percent. To remind everyone, these 10 candidates are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Donald Trump: 25.22</li>
	<li>Ben Carson: 19.78</li>
	<li>Marco Rubio: 9.67</li>
	<li>Jeb Bush: 8.11</li>
	<li>Carly Fiorina: 8.11</li>
	<li>Ted Cruz: 6.89</li>
	<li>Mike Huckabee: 3.56</li>
	<li>Chris Christie: 3.00</li>
	<li>John Kasich: 3.00</li>
	<li>Rand Paul: 3.00</li>
</ul>
<p>The only candidate missing is Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race in September. The lower-tier debate will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rick Santorum</li>
	<li>Bobby Jindal</li>
	<li>George Pataki</li>
	<li>Lindsey Graham</li>
</ul>
<p>The first debate will start at 6 pm ET / 3 pm PT.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the next Republican debate will focus on economics, job growth, taxes, retirement, and technology. The event will be moderated by CNBC's Carl Quintanilla, co-anchor of "Squawk on the Street" and "Squawk Alley," Becky Quick, co-anchor of "Squawk Box," and Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood.</p>
