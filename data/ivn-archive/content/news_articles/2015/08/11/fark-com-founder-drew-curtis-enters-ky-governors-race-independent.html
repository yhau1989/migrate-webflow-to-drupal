<p><strong>KENTUCKY</strong>&nbsp;-- The Lexington Herald-Leader <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/2015/08/10/3982402_farkcom-founder-drew-curtis-files.html?rh=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Monday</a> that digital entrepreneur <strong>Drew Curtis</strong> and his wife, Heather, paid the required fees and&nbsp;submitted&nbsp;enough valid signatures with Kentucky's secretary of state to appear on the November ballot for governor and lieutenant governor. The husband-wife team is running on an independent ticket.</p>

<p>Drew Curtis is the founder of <a href="http://www.fark.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fark.com</a>, a news aggregation site that Curtis describes as a combination of Drudge Report and&nbsp;<em>The Daily Show</em>. According to the report, Drew and Heather would not be the first married couple to seek the state's two highest elective offices.</p>

<p>"Speaking at a news conference in front of the Capitol, Drew Curtis said he and his wife were citizen candidates, not politicians," the Lexington Herald-Leader reports.</p>
<blockquote>"Curtis said he didn't know from which political party he would draw more votes, but he predicted he would win the race and not be a spoiler. He was a Democrat before changing to an independent last year."</blockquote>
<p>On the issues, Curtis laid out a few ideas for Kentucky&nbsp;and identified a couple of problems that would need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>He would&nbsp;consult with his friends in Silicon Valley and try to use his own background and experience to bring broadband Internet access to all parts of Kentucky.</li>
	<li>He <a href="http://www.wave3.com/story/29751080/farkcom-founder-drew-curtis-files-for-governor" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposes a statewide right-to-work law</a>, but does not have a problem with counties adopting right-to-work ordinances, saying the could be "experiments."</li>
	<li>He said the state might have&nbsp;enough&nbsp;money to fund an expanded Medicaid program until 2017, but he was not sure about 2020.</li>
	<li>He would sign into law a measure allowing the use of recreational marijuana if the legislature approved it.</li>
	<li>He said county clerks should "do their job" and issue marriage licenses to all couples who qualify for one.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the report, Curtis refuses to be labeled a liberal or conservative. Instead, he prefers the term "ultra-pragmatist." He said he plans to "use a lot of social media" to win the race and he will not take money from special interests.</p>
