<p>The Republican Party is now one candidate short of fielding two baseball teams. And they’re scratching their heads over the current frontrunner—<a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>—a candidate even the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/kochs-freeze-out-trump-120752.html?cmpid=sf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koch brothers don’t support</a>. Trump leads his nearest opponent by 5 percentage points according to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a>&nbsp;(RCP) average over the last month.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Trump. The whole field behaves wildly. Just look at this figure from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">RCP</a>:</p>

<p>The polls get more chaotic as additional candidates enter the field. So why is that?</p>
<p>The reason our polls behave strangely is because they mirror our (also strange) voting method, a choose-one system called plurality voting/ first past the post. Our ubiquitous choose-one approach is commonly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2011/04/VotingSystems.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">recognized as a dud</a>&nbsp;among voting theorists. We recently even gave it a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electology.org/#!Top-5-Ways-Plurality-Voting-Fails/c17jj/5519c9820cf215f35a2a557b" rel="noopener noreferrer">top-5 list</a>&nbsp;for why it was so bad.</p>
<p>[pullout_blockquote quote="Because poll respondents can only choose one candidate, overlapping platforms find their vote divided." author="Aaron Hamlin, The Center for Election Science"]Part of why our choose-one method fails in polling is because it limits the information you can give. Go ahead. Try to envision giving less information than choosing one candidate. You can’t do it.</p>
<p>Because poll respondents can only choose one candidate, overlapping platforms find their vote divided. And it doesn’t take much to change the outcome—as we learned in the 2000 election.</p>
<p>Add a couple baseball teams’ worth of candidates from the same party and you end up with pure ridiculousness. It’s crazy that any media would imply these polls are meaningful. They’re only as meaningful as their elections that use the same voting method—which is not meaningful at all.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a voting method that avoids this craziness:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/cc04" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval voting</a>. It works by letting voters choose as many candidates as they want, the equivalent of a thumbs up or a thumbs down for each candidate.</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight caught on by saying that our current polling supports a Nickelback-like candidate—referring to a rock band adored by few and despised by many. Unfortunately, FiveThirtyEight stopped short of appreciating that all U.S. voting elects Nickelback-like candidates.</p>
<p>To address the crazy polling results,&nbsp;<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FiveThirtyEight</a>&nbsp;used approval polls from the&nbsp;<a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post Pollster</a>. Along with their other numbers, we’ll use the approval polls below as a proxy for how approval voting would look:</p>
<p><a href="http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/candidate-ranking.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="candidate-ranking" height="555" src="cloudinary://candidate-ranking.jpeg" width="622"></a></p>
<p>You’ll notice Trump’s drop from first to eighth, though his numbers aren’t terrible (a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/26/politics/cnn-orc-data/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN poll</a>&nbsp;has him doing even better). Rubio and Walker are more noticeably in the lead. Because respondents could approve of as many candidates as they wanted, there’s no division of support between candidates (i.e. vote splitting).</p>
<p>At the moment, however, it doesn’t seem to matter whom the Republicans nominate. According to a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/26/politics/cnn-orc-data/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN poll</a>, both Democrats Sanders and Clinton can beat any Republican one-on-one.</p>
<p>Of course, a one-on-one scenario assumes only two general election candidates, a picture distorted by our choose-one voting method—along with debate exclusion and restrictive ballot access laws.</p>
