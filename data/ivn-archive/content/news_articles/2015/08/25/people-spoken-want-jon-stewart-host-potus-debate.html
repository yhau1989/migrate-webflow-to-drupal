[gravityform id="99" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]The proposal for <p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jon-stewart" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jon Stewart</strong></a> to moderate a presidential debate reached 300,000 signatures on Tuesday. The petitioners' starting goal was just 150,000 signatures, which the petition quickly surpassed after going viral.</p>

<p>About two weeks ago, a group of fans launched a petition on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/we-want-jon-stewart-to-moderate-a-2016-presidential-debate" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org</a> asking the <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> to let Stewart moderate one of the fall presidential debates. According to the petitioners, Stewart is more than qualified for the position. During his 16-year run on the <em>Daily Show</em>, he interviewed 15 heads of state, 22 members of the U.S. Cabinet, 32 members of the U.S. Senate, 7 members of the House of Representatives, and countless other political and academic experts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, studies have shown that Stewart was more trustworthy than other mainstream news organizations. A <a href="http://publicreligion.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Final-Immigration-Survey.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 study</a>&nbsp;conducted by the Brookings Institute found that more Americans trusted <em>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em> over MSNBC. A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/02/11/americans-trust-jon-stewart-more-than-bloomberg-and-the-economist-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew study</a>,&nbsp;cited by Forbes,&nbsp;found more Americans trusted Jon Stewart than Bloomberg and the Economist.</p>

<p>Even Democratic presidential candidate <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/martin-omalley" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin O'Malley</a></strong> signed the petition in support of Jon Stewart moderating a debate:</p>
<blockquote lang="en">
<p lang="en">Signed. Jon Stewart moderating or not, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeNeedDebate?src=hash" rel="noopener noreferrer">#WeNeedDebate</a>. <a href="http://t.co/6EGRAv8ypn" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://t.co/6EGRAv8ypn</a> <a href="http://t.co/PN48kZ29fr" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PN48kZ29fr</a></p>

<p>Even if Stewart agrees to moderate a debate, it is not up to him. The petition is trying to reach the <strong>Commission on Presidential Debates</strong>, which has the ultimate authority in selecting moderators. However, a Change.org petition in 2012 started by three high school students successfully garnered enough support to influence the commission to select a female moderator.</p>
