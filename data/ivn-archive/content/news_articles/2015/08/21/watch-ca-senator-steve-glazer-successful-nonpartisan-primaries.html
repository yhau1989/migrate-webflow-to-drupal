<p>Democratic state Senator <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/steve-glazer" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steve Glazer</strong></a> spoke at the <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/08/21/lawmakers-election-experts-talk-voting-rights-ca-nonpartisan-primary-summit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Nonpartisan Primary Summit</a> on Wednesday. The event, hosted by the <a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Independent Voter Project</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://cafwd.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Forward</a></strong>, focused on the impact of California's relatively new nonpartisan, top-two primary system.</p>

<p>Glazer shared his first-hand experience with nonpartisan primaries and how he managed to successfully endure negative attacks from his own party. He faced fellow Democrat Susan Bonilla in a special election to replace Mark DeSaulnier, who is now a member of Congress.</p>

<p>He reflected, "One of the things the top-two did for me is it gave me some room to define what it meant to me to be a Democrat. And the questions is - is my party going to continue to big a big tent where diversity of opinion is tolerated? Or is it going to be rejected?"</p>
<blockquote>"My definition of independent is someone who's there to represent people rather than party or power." - Sen. Steve Glazer</blockquote>
