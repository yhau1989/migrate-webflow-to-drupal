<p>Harvard Law professor <strong>Lawrence Lessig</strong> is exploring a Democratic presidential bid in 2016. Lessig's impetus to run is driven by his desire to pass the Citizen's Equality Act of 2017.</p>

<p>"Jefferson's truth, that all are created equal has become Orwell's meme that some are more equal that others," Lessig explains.</p>

<p>The Citizen's Equality Act of 2017&nbsp;focuses on enhancing voting rights, expanding equal representation of citizens, and exploring citizen-funded elections. Lessig states in his <a href="https://lessigforpresident.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch&nbsp;video</a>&nbsp;that there is a basic "inequality of citizens" and the current system is rigged to help the very few.</p>

<p>"Until this rigged system is fixed, no reform is even possible," he states.</p>

<p>Lessig's idea is to institute a "referendum president" who would serve only as long as it takes to pass the Citizen's Equality Act. His 2016 campaign is based on crowd-funding efforts. If the campaign hits its funding target of $1 million by Labor Day and the leading candidates have not committed to making citizen's equality their first official priority upon entering office, Lessig will enter the Democratic race as a referendum candidate.</p>

<p>"It is not about one person; it is about a principle," Lessig says. "Democracy must respect us all as equals."</p>

<p>Essentially, Lessig wants to run for president to pass one bill, and then hand the reins over to the elected vice president.</p>

<p>In July, Lessig left his position as CEO and chairman of <a href="https://mayday.us" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayday PAC</a>, the "super PAC to end all super PACs." He co-founded Mayday to support candidates who were serious about campaign finance reform. Unfortunately, despite raising $10 million to influence eight targeted races in 2014, Mayday had success in only two,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/2014-elections-mayday-pac-larry-lessig-112617.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> confirms.</p>

<p>While Lessig's campaign might not gain much steam, his idea for a referendum president is definitely innovative. What it will take to fix the election process and government gridlock is stopping the corruption of money in politics, Lessig stated in <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/07/a-radical-fix-for-the-republic" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Magazine</a>. Without solving this problem <em>first</em>, Lessig argues, we won't solve anything else.</p>
