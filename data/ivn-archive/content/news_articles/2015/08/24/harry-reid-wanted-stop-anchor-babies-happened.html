<p>When <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> talks about illegal immigration, ending birthright citizenship, and uses the term "anchor babies," it gets a lot of attention from the media and from the Democratic Party, who like the portray the GOP front-runner as racist for his comments. Yet, it was not long ago when some leading Democrats shared the same views about illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>In fact, in 1993, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/harry-reid" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Harry Reid</strong></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75a9Wa6KL7k" rel="noopener noreferrer">stood on the Senate floor</a> and bemoaned the fact that the United States was offering social services to children of illegal immigrants because they are granted birthright citizenship.</p>
<blockquote>"If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant? No sane country would do that, right? Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship, and guarantee full access to all public and social services this society provides -- and that's a lot of services." - U.S. Sen. Harry Reid</blockquote>
<p>What would today's Democratic Party say about Harry Reid then?</p>
