<p>The early successes of California's nonpartisan, top-two primary&nbsp;are paving the way toward increased voter representation and decreased partisan gridlock. What this means for all voters is that they finally have a voice when it comes to deciding their representatives, who are supposed to&nbsp;put their constituents&nbsp;before party interests or re-election goals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openprimaries.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Open Primaries</strong></a> <a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/research_california" rel="noopener noreferrer">released findings</a>&nbsp;Tuesday articulating the benefits the nonpartisan, top-two primary -- authored by the <strong><a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project </a></strong>--&nbsp;has had on California elections and the state legislature since its enactment in the 2012 election cycle.</p>

<p>Jason Olson and Omar Ali conclude that the nonpartisan system enhances representation for&nbsp;all voters rather than just party-affiliated voters, and produces a functioning legislature as well as&nbsp;competitive elections.</p>

<p>By 2010, the approval rating of the California legislature was just 14 percent, the report states. It was in this atmosphere that the majority of California voters (54%) approved the nonpartisan, top-two primary under Proposition 14, despite substantial efforts by the Republican and Democratic parties to continue the status quo of semi-closed primaries.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Top-Two allows representatives the opportunity to actually legislate on behalf of their constituents." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295666896" handle="" hashes=""]According to the report, 42 percent of Californians now approve of the state legislature.&nbsp;This figure has steadily climbed since the new primary&nbsp;system was enacted. One study shows the legislature's&nbsp;approval rating at&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=1125" rel="noopener noreferrer">49 percent</a>.</p>

<p>Before Top-Two, incumbents were guaranteed re-election if they voted along party lines. From 2002 to 2010, only two incumbents were unseated from office, the report says.</p>

<p>Top-Two allows representatives the opportunity to actually legislate on behalf of their constituents. The report states that candidates have more independence from party control and no longer need to toe-the-party-line.&nbsp;Candidates are reaching across the aisle to work together rather than remaining locked into partisan-dominated ideological corners.</p>

<p>Californian Republican State&nbsp;Senator<strong> Anthony Cannella</strong> stated that the nonpartisan, top-two primary gives "more courage to my Republican colleagues." He continued, "They were afraid of getting primaried. Now, it’s not just their base they have to appeal to.”</p>

<p>Every year since the nonpartisan, top-two primary was enacted, the state legislature has passed balanced budgets. Moreover, legislation on gun control, immigration, and educational financing -- what remain heavily partisan issues in Congress -- were able to pass in California as a consequence of Top-Two.</p>

<p>One of the most important indicators of a well-functioning representative democracy is a government that is responsive to the needs of its people and can operate efficiently and effectively. What proponents of Top-Two believe and what research has shown is that the best way to ensure a government operates the way it is supposed to is by&nbsp;making sure lawmakers are accountable to ALL of their constituents, not just a minority&nbsp;bloc of voters.</p>
