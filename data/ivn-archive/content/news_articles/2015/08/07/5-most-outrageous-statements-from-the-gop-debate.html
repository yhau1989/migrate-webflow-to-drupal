<p>Many viewers turned in to the first GOP presidential debate to learn about the different&nbsp;candidates crowding the field. Yet,&nbsp;certainly others were just waiting to hear if anything inflammatory would continue to flow from Donald Trump's mouth. Trump did not disappoint, but neither did a few other candidates.</p>

<p>Here are the most outrageous statements from the GOP debate and what was missed because of them:</p>

<p>Scott Walker, Governor of Wisconsin:</p>
<blockquote>“Probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton’s email server than the United States Congress.”</blockquote>
<p>In FY 2014 alone, the US Government was subject to&nbsp;at least&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234601-cyberattacks-on-government-hit-record-high" rel="noopener noreferrer">70,000</a>&nbsp;cyber attacks and it's estimated that number will only increase in the years to come.</p>

<p>Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor:</p>
<blockquote>“The military is not a social experiment.&nbsp;The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.”</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the US military has a wide variety of purposes apart from killing and breaking things. From administering humanitarian aid to conducing search and rescue operations the scope of US military action extends far beyond the battlefield.</p>

<p>Ben Carson, neurosurgeon:</p>
<blockquote>"I haven't said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that… I am the only one to take out half of a brain, although if you took me to Washington you would think someone beat me to it."</blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump, businessman:</p>

<p>The audience erupted to Trump's response during Megyn Kelly's question, "You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals..." to which he interrupted:</p>
<blockquote>“Only Rosie O'Donnell”</blockquote>

<p>and of course because only Trump deserves two:</p>
<blockquote>“Our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid and the Mexican government is much smarter.”</blockquote>
<p>While the sound bites are good for ratings, a more substantive discussion on the issues of military policy, cyber security, and foreign policy were sorely lacking during Thursday's GOP primary debate.</p>
