<p>With the United States launching a new <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/politics/new-navy-sub-uss-john-warner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 billion submarine</a> and moving towards putting&nbsp;into place our new $100+ million per unit <a href="http://breakingdefense.com/2015/08/the-f-35b-from-probation-to-transformation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">F-35 fighters</a>, joint military exercises between India and the United Kingdom should give us a moment of pause--that the biggest, and most expensive isn't always the best.</p>

<p>In a series of war games held in England, code named&nbsp;Operation Indradhanush, Indian and British pilots went through a series of simulations of joint exercises and competitive dogfights with their respective military's fighter jets, the SU-30MKI and the Eurofighter Typhoon.</p>

<p>The British fared far worse than their historical dogfighting reputation--losing 12-0 to the <a href="http://www.rt.com/uk/311839-indian-air-force-raf/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian fighter pilots</a>.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Politically in America, we need to get a grip on our military spending. " author="David Yee"]Training may have played a large role, but the most interesting part is the price tag difference between the two fighters.

<p>The SU-30MKI, used by India, is a Russian export fighter and comes with a price tag of about $56 million delivered. Whereas the Typhoon, which was used by the British, has the lofty unit cost (including production costs) of $192 million.</p>

<p>How is it that a fighter jet that costs almost 4 times less can outclass an expensive Western fighter that was specifically designed to tackle the SU-30 platform?</p>

<p>The answer is something that all of the world's high-tech militaries are finding out--the answer to high-tech is often low-tech, and sometimes just an overwhelming amount of it.</p>

<p>It's not like America doesn't have experience with low-tech strategy. We used fleets of plywood Pt-boats to attack the massive Japanese Navy while we built up our own fleet and we neutralized the German's impressive blitzkrieg by employing massive numbers of inferior tanks.</p>

<p>While the U.S. and Europe pay the lion's share of the world's military expenses, the rest of the world is seeking military parity on a budget.</p>

<p>For instance, the U.S. maintains a massive carrier fleet, which allows our navy to dominate the oceans of the world--yet China is seeking a simple, and relatively cheap neutralization weapon, <a href="http://www.rt.com/news/267115-china-tests-hypersonic-missile/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the WU-14.</a> It is a hyper-sonic missile designed to destroy targets without interception.</p>

<p>On land, the Islamic State militia (IS) has maintained a successful low-tech strategy, even with high-tech air-power controlling the skies above them.</p>

<p>Politically in America, we need to get a grip on our military spending. It makes up almost <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/works-on/military-security/" rel="noopener noreferrer">54 percent</a> of our discretionary national budget--but do we really need the biggest and best?</p>

<p>Our troops are (and should be) outfitted with some of the finest weapons and equipment available, but the expensive hardware is where we should really take notice.</p>

<p>There's a place for high-tech, but it cannot be entangled into every military system we own--otherwise we become susceptible to every low-tech and cyber-attack thrown at our military.</p>

<p>We need to change paradigms. We need to have a military that is the best, but definitely not the most expensive (in terms of unit costs, etc) on the planet.</p>
