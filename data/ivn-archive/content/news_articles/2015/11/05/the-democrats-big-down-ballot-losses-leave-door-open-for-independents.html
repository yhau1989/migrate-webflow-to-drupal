<p>Republican strategist Rory Cooper posted this political jab at&nbsp;the Democratic Party on Nov 4:</p>

<p>Regardless of whether these are actual factual numbers (they do seem to be), he's definitely pointing out a growing concern in Democratic circles -- i.e. an inability to create vast 'coat-tail effects' during national elections.</p>

<p>The House and Senate ebb and flow&nbsp;each&nbsp;two-year election cycle, but losing so many state-level officials seems almost crippling to the party.</p>

<p>In less than a decade, it seems that the Democratic Party has abandoned its widely successful '<a href="http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/gov-democrat-howard-deans-fifty-state-strategy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">50-state</a>' strategy, a brainchild of&nbsp;<strong>Howard Dean</strong>, a Democratic guru and once party chairman.</p>

<p>Employing this strategy from 2005 to 2009, the Democratic Party made gains even in the reddest of the red states, gaining 39 state legislative&nbsp;seats, 3 U.S. House seats, and 1 U.S. Senate seat.</p>

<p>But now, it seems these gains have eroded to almost total losses.</p>

<p>Dropping the ball has allowed independent candidates an avenue to challenge seats. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/greg-orman" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Orman</a></strong>'s nearly successful Senate&nbsp;bid was fueled partly&nbsp;by the Democratic Party's total lack of support for their own candidate, Chad Taylor. This allowed Orman to challenge what was once thought to be a completely secure Republican seat.</p>

<p>Modern campaign strategy seems to be based in two parts:&nbsp;consolidate the base during the primary, then move to the center to win over the moderates.</p>

<p>Independents can upset this strategy by capturing and holding the moderate vote from the earliest moments of the primary, then work on capturing swing-voters during the general election when the other candidates are scrambling in their attempts to 'fake moderation.'</p>

<p>As the Democrats seem&nbsp;to be solely interested in holding the presidency and reclaiming the Senate in 2016, independents have the best opportunity yet to challenge Republicans in the 'forgotten races.'</p>

<p>Time is running out for independents to launch viable campaigns, but the current political climate has definitely presented potential candidates&nbsp;with the chance at a bottom-up strategy for 2016 -- one that could easily carry into 2018 and beyond.</p>
