<p>As the 2016 presidential election draws nearer, questions are being raised about <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>’s role as an honorary co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, a Republican-and-Democrat controlled board that determines the rules and particulars of U.S. general election presidential debates.</p>

<p>According <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/01/bill-clinton-on-leadership-board-of-presidential-debate-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">to</a> The Daily Caller, <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> serves as an honorary co-chair for the organization along with former President Jimmy Carter. The CPD also <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=commission-leadership" rel="noopener noreferrer">lists</a> deceased former Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford as honorary co-chairs.</p>
<blockquote>“<em>It is unclear, however, how Carter and Clinton function in these roles</em>,” wrote reporter Kerry Picket. “<em>Additionally, considering Jeb Bush’s run for the presidency, if it is an issue of simply lending one’s name to a board and not participating in any process, it is unknown why both former presidents George W. Bush and his father George H.W. Bush are not included as honorary chairs</em>,” she added.</blockquote>
<p>Hot Air <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/02/surprise-bill-clinton-is-on-the-commission-on-presidential-debates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> that CPD chairman&nbsp;Michael D. McCurry served as press secretary during Bill Clinton’s presidency.</p>

<p>If current Democratic presidential front-runner <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> ends up winning her party’s nomination, Bill Clinton and Michael McCurry’s roles on the board governing U.S. general election presidential debates could potentially pose a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>The Commission on Presidential Debates recently sparked controversy when it <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/commission-debates-no-change-15-percent-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that despite the rise of independent voters as a leading portion of the U.S. electorate, it would not change the 15 percent minimum polling rule that effectively blocks most serious third-party candidates who appear on enough ballots to win the presidency from participating&nbsp;in general election presidential debates.</p>
