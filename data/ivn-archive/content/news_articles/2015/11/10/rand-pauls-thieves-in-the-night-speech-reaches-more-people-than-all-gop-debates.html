<p>Recently, U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) posted a video of a 3 a.m. Senator <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/?s=rand+paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a>(R-Ky.) speech on the floor of the Senate calling for senators to oppose the bipartisan budget deal before it was&nbsp;signed into law by President Obama last week.</p>

<p>Lee posted the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/senatormikelee/videos/1028817943816565/" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, titled “<em>Protecting Social Security from the Thieves in the Night</em>,” and urged his Facebook followers to share it.</p>

<p>“<em>Last night while you were sleeping the Senate voted to steal $150 billion dollars from the Social Security Trust Fund. I joined 34 of my colleagues in a vote to prevent this raid. I would like to thank Senator Rand Paul for leading the fight to protect to Social Security from the thieves in Washington, who seem to think that if they steal from the American people at night while they are sleeping that they will get away with it. I was proud to vote with Senator Paul on his point of order that would have protected Social Security, and I ask you to help me shine a light on what Washington has tried to hide from you in the darkness of night</em>,” said Sen. Lee.</p>

<p>He added, “<em>If everyone who sees this message shares it, it will reach millions of Americans. As someone who has been fighting for years to reform our broken government in Washington, I know it is exhausting, I sympathize with your frustration, and I understand your impatience. But don’t give up. Washington wants you to give up.</em>”</p>

<p>Lee’s video has been shared over 1.3 million times and counting, and has been viewed by over 25 million people.</p>

<p>Lee <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/11/04/mike_lee_explains_why_rand_pauls_debt_limit_plea_reached_60_million_people_on_facebook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said,</a> “<em>This Facebook post reached over 60 million people — more people than watched all three Republican presidential debates combined. For the simple fact that the American people are frustrated by what is happening in Washington.</em>”</p>

<p>According <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/11/03/thieves-night-mike-lee-facebook-video-rand-paul-goes-viral" rel="noopener noreferrer">to</a> Fox News, the viral video’s popularity is “<em>not far from a Facebook record</em>” that “<em>was reportedly set this year by the White House when a video from the Correspondents’ Dinner garnered 27 million views in just 36 hours.</em>”</p>
