<h1><a href="http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/blog/what-could-an-independent-run/" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Impact Could An Independent Run By Jim Webb Have on 2016?</a></h1>
<p><strong>Source: &nbsp;Austin Plier, FairVote</strong></p>

<p>My Take: An interesting piece exploring angles not often explored, including a role in the electoral vote outcome of a number of swing states--especially his native Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>Source: &nbsp;Caitlin Maple, PublicCEO</strong></p>

<p>My Take: &nbsp;While the article touches on the fact that large segments of the population are underrepresented at the polls and there is a seemingly endless discussion about this, one does wonder what is really being done to deal with it.</p>

<p><strong>Source: Chad Peace, <a href="http://sdcitybeat.com/article-16801-Primary-(election)-responsibility.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego&nbsp;City Beat</a></strong></p>

<p>My Take: A good discussion of the institutional barriers placed on voter rights by the political parties--without an argument for less party involvement.</p>

<p>My Take: &nbsp;With 43% of New Hampshire voters having no party affiliation, the author, tired of the partisan fighting, is calling out for her state to join a growing movement.</p>

<p>My Take: &nbsp;An extensive look not only at Nebraska, which has a top-two primary for state legislative races, but the nationwide movement toward such reform, including in Congress.</p>

<p><strong>Source: Bob Mercer, <a href="http://www.bhpioneer.com/blogs/blog_two/blog_two_text/article_d069a59a-7452-11e5-ae67-5fbfc0871106.html " rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Hills (SD) Pioneer</a></strong></p>

<p>My Take: &nbsp;It’s a look at voter frustration and how voters really no longer know what the parties actually stand for. From there, the article moves to remedies currently under discussion, including a nonpartisan primary. SOMETHING to make voters pay attention.</p>
