<p>Historically, presidential races have come down to only a handful of toss-up states being the difference between victory and defeat -- the red/blue map has become fairly well-defined.</p>

<p>Enter <strong>John Bel Edwards</strong> (D) who won the governorship of Louisiana on November 21 by a fairly resounding margin, capturing 54 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>State governorships can give a glimpse into the 'at-large' intentions of a state, but this is hardly a sure thing in politics.</p>

<p>Louisiana has a long history, since WWII, of flipping allegiances between Democrats and Republicans for president -- currently in the longest <a href="http://www.270towin.com/states/Louisiana" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican streak</a> since George W. Bush in 2000.</p>

<p>If the gubernatorial race has any predictive powers, it is that the Republicans are going to have a harder race than originally anticipated.</p>

<p>With most analysts predicting 10 or fewer toss-up states, the electoral college map <a href="http://www.270towin.com/maps/2016-election-toss-up-states" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavily favors </a>the Democrats in 2016.</p>

<p>While Louisiana lost a critical electoral vote after Hurricane Katrina, due to population shifts, its 8 votes are critical in almost every winning combination for the Republicans. With 10 toss-ups, they have 72 winning combinations. However, without Louisiana, this drops to only 55.</p>

<p>Neither party likes to pour money into a state that they have held securely for 16 years, but Louisiana voters can likely expect a&nbsp;non-stop battle over the airwaves in 2016, and possibly more campaign stops than usual.</p>

<p>The ripple effect will likely be felt throughout the election map. If the parties (especially the Democrats) decide to make Louisiana a contested state, then there are really only 3 other toss-up states that matter to the Republicans -- Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Losing <em><span>any two of them</span></em> destroys any chances at 270 electoral votes for the Republicans if Louisiana falls.</p>

<p>Even with a clean-sweep of the largest prizes, the Republicans still come up 20 votes shy of 270.</p>

<p>In 2012, the candidates campaigned to the 10 swing states--Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin--and ignored the rest of the country. More than six-times the money was spent in Florida than in the 40 ignored states combined.</p>

<p>While this was bad, could it get even worse if only 4 states really mattered for the presidential race?</p>
