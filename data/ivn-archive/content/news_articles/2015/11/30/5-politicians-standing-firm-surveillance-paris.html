<p>Since the Paris terrorist attacks on November 13, various mainstream news <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/20/politics/paris-syria-isis-surveillance-intelligence-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlets</a> have <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/11/28/after-paris-us-political-shift-on-privacy-vs-security" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that the politics of surveillance have shifted. A shift would indicate that instead of rolling back surveillance policies in favor of more privacy, more invasive policies could be enacted.</p>

<p>U.S. Sen. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/marco-rubio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco Rubio</a></strong> used the attacks to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/17/marco-rubio-hits-ted-cruz-rand-paul-intelligence-g/" rel="noopener noreferrer">accuse</a> fellow Republican presidential candidates <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a></strong> of forcing a "weakening of our intelligence-gathering capabilities" that ultimately "leaves America vulnerable." Yet despite this shift, there are still at least 5 politicians who remain consistent about surveillance after Paris.</p>
<h3><strong>1. U.S. Rep. Justin Amash (MI-03)</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/667127216107581440" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Twitter</a>, Amash, a noted critic of surveillance policies, wrote of Rubio's <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/marco-rubio-tom-cotton-bill-delay/2015/11/18/id/702692/" rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a> for a bill to extend the bulk collection of metadata that was a key provision of the Patriot Act:</p>
<blockquote>.<a href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio" rel="noopener noreferrer"><s>@</s><b>marcorubio</b></a> just cosponsored bill to extend unconstitutional spying on all Americans. He'd fit right in with GOP of past. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YesterdayIsOver?src=hash" rel="noopener noreferrer"><s>#</s><b>YesterdayIsOver</b></a></blockquote>
<h3><strong>2. U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (KY-04)</strong></h3>
<p>The Kentucky representative <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/paris-us-political-shift-privacy-security-35445910" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> ABC News over Thanksgiving weekend how the immediate aftermath of a tragedy is the time when the government tries to capitalize on citizens' fears to expand its power:</p>
<blockquote>"Within six weeks of 9/11 they passed the Patriot Act. And it's only natural they would try to do the same thing this time."</blockquote>
<h3><strong>3. U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (KY)</strong></h3>
<p>Calling the argument that the Paris attacks required more surveillance "bullshit," Sen. Paul also <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/11/19/rand_paul_bullshit_they_need_more_surveillance_after_paris_attacks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that surveillance policies of the past and present did not stop the Paris attacks:</p>
<blockquote>"They are collecting your phone records as we speak, they did not miss a beat, even though we voted on reform, all your phone records are being collected and stored in Utah. Did it stop the attack in Paris? No."</blockquote>
<h3><strong>4. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) </strong></h3>
<p>One of the candidates attacked by Rubio for opposing Patriot Act bulk collections, Cruz <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/29/ted-cruz-attacks-marco-rubio-on-privacy-and-immigration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> that his rival:</p>
<blockquote>"...is trying to respond to the criticism that he has received that he is not willing to protect the Fourth Amendment privacy rights of law-abiding citizens."</blockquote>
<p>Separately, Cruz <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/670658721219936256" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> one of his endorsements on Twitter which noted his&nbsp;role in passing the USA Freedom Act:</p>
<blockquote>"[Cruz] will use every tool we have to win, but he will never betray the very Constitution we are sworn to defend."</blockquote>
<p>Even before its passage, there was fierce <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/05/18/usa-freedom-act-doesnt-live-name-privacy-advocates-claim/" rel="noopener noreferrer">debate</a> about how much <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/09/21/despite-usa-freedom-act-fight-government-spying-far/" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy</a> the Freedom Act provided Americans, but Cruz's positions have indicated that more surveillance is not the answer.</p>
<h3><strong>5. U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden (OR)</strong></h3>
<p>The Oregon Democrat has long been a critic of Washington's surveillance policies. Echoing some of the sentiments of Paul and Massie, Wyden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/11/16/paris-attacks-should-be-wake-up-call-for-more-digital-surveillance-cia-director-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> that broadly-defined powers are not even effective, which was also the case in France where an aggressive <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/11/16/rand-paul-edward-snowden-among-political-targets-after-paris-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance</a> <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/71651/20150724/surveillance-law-charlie-hebdo-france.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">law</a> was passed following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January:</p>
<blockquote>"While some people seem eager to seize on this crisis to resurrect failed policies of the past, the facts show mass surveillance doesnâ€™t protect us from terrorist attacks."</blockquote>
