<p>Any debate about Social Security will at some point devolve to five words: “Raise the cap, problem solved.”</p>

<p>There are two things that you need to know about this slogan.</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is false; and</li>
	<li>Even if it were true, the policy option is simply a bad idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Administration, completely eliminating the cap solves about 50-70% of the financing gap, which is about halfway to the meaning of the word 'solved.'</p>

<p>The larger problem is that eliminating the cap is not a good idea. The more Social Security looks like welfare, the more the program will simply become a political priority in which the needs of the elderly are subjected to the mercy of politicians. Does that really sound like a good idea?</p>

<p>FDR didn't think so.&nbsp;In 1934, he wrote, "We must not allow this type of insurance to become a dole through the mingling of insurance and relief. It is not charity. It must be financed by contributions, not taxes." He did not want&nbsp;Social Security&nbsp;to become an income transfer, not from rich to poor&nbsp;and not even from child to parent.&nbsp;He <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/history/genrev.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">vigorously&nbsp;opposed</a> these ideas, and even&nbsp;<a href="http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/35147?ret=True" rel="noopener noreferrer">vetoed legislation</a> that undermined his concept of a self-sustaining program.</p>

<p>The difference is a question of whether revenue collected by Social Security is a tax to pay for welfare or a contribution to pay for insurance.&nbsp;Today, it is difficult to call this revenue a tax.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The more Social Security looks like welfare, the more the program will simply become a political priority in which the needs of the elderly are subjected to the mercy of politicians." author=""]For the most part, when you contribute a dollar you get a promise of a dollar in the future. That isn't a tax - it is a loan.&nbsp;If you feel that you will not collect the dollar, the loan may be a junk bond, but it is not a tax.&nbsp;As long as there is the promise to be repaid, Social Security is a contribution.

<p>Social Security is progressive. The more you make, the more your benefits will cost. Progressivity means that by the time that you are affected by the cap, any&nbsp;incremental earned benefit is negligible. The benefit provides little more than a rebate to reduce the cost.&nbsp;At the cap,&nbsp;Social&nbsp;Security&nbsp;is more of a&nbsp;tax than a contribution. So removing the cap will draw in the tax revenue that FDR opposed.</p>

<p>Roosevelt&nbsp;worried&nbsp;that this type of&nbsp;revenue subject benefits to non-programmatic events.&nbsp;Every dollar raised by removing the cap could be used for other priorities, such as lowing the debt for example.&nbsp;FDR didn't want the needs of the elderly to have to compete with other political priorities like student loan reform.&nbsp; He wanted a system that was self-sustaining, independent of politicians.</p>

<p>FDR lost, and the argument will follow that removing the cap is simply another step in a long journey of a living concept.&nbsp;We abandoned FDR's vision half a century ago, and this step is a necessary part of the transition. The&nbsp;reasoning is the manifestation of Will Roger's theory, "If Stupidity got us into this mess, then why can't it get us out?"</p>

<p>We are going in the wrong direction. Yes, FDR lost, but he was right.&nbsp;Roosevelt wanted a system in which benefits&nbsp;were&nbsp;earned insulated from politicians like Bernie Sanders and Jeb Bush who want the power to control how the resources of Social Security are distributed.&nbsp;It is about the power, not the principle of what Social Security should do.</p>

<p>Politicians would of course like nothing more than the power to create benefits by magic.&nbsp;Jeb Bush wants to give every poor retiree a raise. Senator Elizabeth Warren would like to give every senior a raise this year.&nbsp;Senator Bernie Sanders would like to give every senior a raise forever. Their visions may&nbsp;differ, but all of these people want the benefits of Social Security to be a measure of political power rather than a result of contributions to a contributory benefits system.</p>

<p>This system can have only one outcome: politicians bidding for their election with our money. Is that a good idea? Do we want the elderly to be just another political priority?</p>

<p>We may not get back to the self-sustaining system that FDR wanted. We may have to inject tax revenue.&nbsp;We may have to make benefit adjustments as well. Before we do, we should be talking about how these changes will affect the program on which millions depend.</p>
