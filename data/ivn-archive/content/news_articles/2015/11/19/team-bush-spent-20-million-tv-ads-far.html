<p>Former Florida Gov. <strong>Jeb Bush (R)</strong> and supporters have now spent roughly $20 million toward assaulting the airwaves thus far in the 2016 presidential race -- more than twice as much as any other candidate or outside group -- according to data from media and communications agency SMG Delta.</p>

<p>The campaign committee itself has spent $438,000 on TV ads in early primary states Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, dwarfed by the $19.5 million sum spent by the pro-Bush Super PAC, Right to Rise.</p>

<p>By comparison, Conservative Solutions Project -- which supports Florida Sen. <strong>Marco Rubio (R)&nbsp;</strong>-- has spent $8.4 million and groups supporting former Secretary of State&nbsp;<strong>Hillary Clinton (D)</strong> have spent $8.3 million.</p>

<p>Other big spenders to this point in the 2016 election season include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ohio Gov. <strong>John Kasich (R)</strong>: $7.3 million -- all from two outside groups</li>
	<li>New Jersey Gov. <strong>Chris Christie (R)</strong>: $5.7 million -- $407,000 from the campaign, $5.3 million from Super PAC</li>
	<li>Louisiana Gov. <strong>Bobby Jindal (R)</strong> (who has just suspended his campaign): $3.3 million -- all from outside groups</li>
	<li>Vermont Sen. <strong>Bernie Sanders (D)</strong>: $3 million -- all from the campaign</li>
	<li>South Carolina Sen. <strong>Lindsey Graham (R)</strong>: $1.7 million -- $100,000 from the campaign, $1.6 million from Super PAC</li>
	<li><strong>Ben Carson (R)</strong>: $1.5 million -- all from the campaign</li>
</ul>
