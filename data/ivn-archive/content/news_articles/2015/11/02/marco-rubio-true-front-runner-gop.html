<p>Despite <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong>'s consistent lead in most polls and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ben-carson" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Carson</a></strong>'s lead in Iowa polls, another&nbsp;Republican presidential candidate is increasingly being called a front-runner by the press.</p>

<p>Ross Douthat of the <em>New York Times</em> recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/opinion/sunday/rubio-the-unusual-front-runner.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> that Florida U.S. Senator <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/marco-rubio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco Rubio</a></strong> may win the nomination through process of elimination because "no major party has ever nominated a figure like Trump or Carson."</p>

<p>NBC News <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/marco-rubio-new-favorite-win-gop-nomination-n437516" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Rubio's rise is attributed to "declining Republican optimism" about <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong>, with whom Rubio shares several policy positions. Fox News media critic Howard Kurtz also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/27/rubio-may-hate-senate-but-could-be-stealth-front-runner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">speculated</a> whether Rubio might be the last candidate standing. Republican strategists such as Gary Marx <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/06/is-marco-rubio-the-new-favorite-to-win-the-gop-nomination.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">argue</a>&nbsp;that Rubio could emerge as a front-runner by uniting differing party factions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/07/23/experts-say-marco-rubio-may-gops-key-victory-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">idea</a> of Rubio as a front-runner is not new, but how do those prospects shape up?</p>

<p>Although often <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2015/10/26/marco_rubio_packing_it_in_after_one_senate_term" rel="noopener noreferrer">hailed</a> as "the future of the Republican Party," Rubio is hobbled with low fundraising numbers, especially from small contributors - a sign of grassroots support. According to OpenSecrets.org, about 20% (roughly $3 million) of his <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00030612" rel="noopener noreferrer">funds</a> come from small individual contributors. Sen. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a></strong>, whose polling numbers are about half of Rubio's, has <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00030836" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised</a> almost $4.5 million from small contributors.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="About 20% (roughly $3 million) of Rubio's funds come from small individual contributors." author=""]Rubio, who receives a wider share of funds from large individual contributions, is the expected beneficiary of casino owner and billionaire Sheldon Adelson's <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2015/04/27/marco-rubio-may-big-winner-sheldon-adelsons-unofficial-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wealth</a>. In addition to the senator's well-known <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/marco-rubio-invades-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawkish</a> foreign policy, his support of a bill this summer to block states from loosening online gambling rules was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/25/in-n-h-marco-rubio-defends-sponsoring-sheldon-adelson-backed-gambling-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">considered</a> another appeal for Adelson's money.</p>

 "[h]e is accustomed to thinking about American foreign policy as a responsible policy maker. He is ready to be an informed and assertive decision-maker."<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/11967664/Jeb-Bushs-nightmare-week-continues-as-key-donor-plumps-for-Marco-Rubio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/us/politics/paul-singer-influential-billionaire-throws-support-to-marco-rubio-for-president.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news" rel="noopener noreferrer">news outlets</a> also reported over the weekend that billionaire New York investor Paul Singer was investing in Rubio <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/11967664/Jeb-Bushs-nightmare-week-continues-as-key-donor-plumps-for-Marco-Rubio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">because</a></p>

<p>Drudge also <a href="http://drudgetoday.com/v2/r?n=0&amp;s=2&amp;c=1&amp;pn=Anonymous&amp;u=http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2015/10/31/marco-rubios-new-billionaire-backer-top-funder-open-borders/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> over the weekend that Singer lobbied in favor of the immigration reform effort Rubio spear-headed in 2013. The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/politics/donald-trump-marco-rubio-foreign-policy-tweet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">political</a> fallout from the GOP led Rubio to distance himself from the program that has often been <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2015/10/12/how-marco-rubio-might-win-back-us-conservatives-n2063628/page/full" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/17/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-immigration-bill-not-amnesty/" rel="noopener noreferrer">amnesty</a> for illegal immigrants. Public knowledge of Singer's financial support could renew scrutiny of Rubio's past backing of immigration reform and raise questions about the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419744/has-marco-rubio-really-learned-his-lesson-immigration-jim-geraghty" rel="noopener noreferrer">sincerity</a> of the latter's policy shift.</p>

<p>Despite the praise in the press and his presumed securing of wealthy benefactors, Rubio has <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/no-rubio-isnt-the-front-runner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">further</a> <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/03/30/marco-rubio-faces-many-doubts-as-he-prepares-to-announce-2016-bid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">liabilities</a>. First, his current poll numbers are actually lower than they were when he announced his candidacy in April. In the spring, Rubio's numbers were around 15%, compared to approximately 10% now.</p>

<p>Second, although receiving generous donations from Adelson and others would boost Rubio's campaign, largesse is not necessarily an indicator that the senator is or will be the front-runner. Jeb Bush's consistent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead</a> in overall fundraising numbers has not kept him out of the single digits in national polls. <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/12/03/sheldon-adelson-ended-up-spending-150-million" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adelson</a> poured $15 million into Newt Gingrich's campaign in 2012 who, aside from winning the South Carolina primary, never&nbsp;put up a&nbsp;serious challenge for the nomination.</p>

<p>The Iowa Caucuses are still three months away, so the Republican race could still take a new shape.&nbsp;Rubio could emerge as the front-runner or the nominee, but several obstacles remain in his way.</p>
