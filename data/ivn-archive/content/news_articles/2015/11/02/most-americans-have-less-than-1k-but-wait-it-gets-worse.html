<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-2015-10-06?siteid=yhoof2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Market Watch</a> reported on a new study that most Americans have less than $1,000 in a savings account--with almost 20 percent having none.</p>

<p><a href="http://ei.marketwatch.com//Multimedia/2015/10/05/Photos/NS/MW-DV816_age_gr_20151005175202_NS.jpg?uuid=4f945a46-6bab-11e5-89f5-0015c588e0f6" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" height="414" src="cloudinary://MW-DV816_age_gr_20151005175202_NS.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>And while this figure seems staggering, the problem is actually much worse.</p>

<p>Retirement accounts are booming, hitting <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/29/retirement/401k-balances/" rel="noopener noreferrer">record highs</a> this year. But what happens in a prolonged bear market?</p>

<p>When the heirs to the Walmart fortune can lose <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-14/wal-mart-heirs-see-9-billion-vanish-in-a-day-as-shares-plummet" rel="noopener noreferrer">$11 billion</a>&nbsp;in a single market day, ordinary investors are eventually left out in the cold when the market free-falls.</p>

<p>Homeowners have faced similar evaporations to wealth all over the nation in collapsing home values, once seen as a safe haven for wealth preservation.</p>

<p>Why are Americans content to have almost no real money, while seeing their other assets evaporate on a regular cycle as markets go from boom to bust?</p>

<p>Therein lies the worst reality. The average American has&nbsp;little to no "real" money or assets and don't have a clue as to how to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Our politicians give us a steady stream of 'answers,' from privatizing Social Security to eliminating the Federal Reserve, because the 'real answer' is too hard for most Americans to accomplish in our society of consumerism.</p>

<p>We encourage consumption and over-extension of credit, all while never emphasizing the value of creating a savings cushion of hard currency to weather bad times.</p>

<p>But it's much easier to buy into any number of quick fix plans from our politicians.</p>

<p>And so for the next four years, America will be run by whoever can present the best "chicken in every pot" solution to our modern problems.</p>

<p>But if we pick wrong--we'd better be prepared to have our goose cooked.</p>
