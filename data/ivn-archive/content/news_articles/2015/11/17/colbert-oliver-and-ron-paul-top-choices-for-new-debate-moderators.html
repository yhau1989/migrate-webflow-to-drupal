<p>Ahead of last week's GOP and Democrat debates, IVN conducted&nbsp;an opinion poll asking readers, "If it was your choice, who would be the debate moderator?"</p>

<p>Respondents could choose as many&nbsp;news personalities they preferred as well as someone who wasn't included. This method, known as approval polling, means votes couldn't be&nbsp;“taken away” from any other choice&nbsp;because participants could select any potential moderator they preferred.</p>

<p>Over 400 readers responded with their top choices, a&nbsp;majority of whom (53 percent) wanted to see&nbsp;<strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> as a presidential debate&nbsp;moderator. <strong>John Oliver</strong> placed second with 29 percent approval and former U.S. Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas), took third with 17 percent.</p>

<p>One of the actual moderators from last week's GOP debate, Fox News commentator <strong>Neil Cavuto</strong>, placed 7th with 8 percent.&nbsp;Surprisingly, although he was not named in the poll directly, <strong>Jon Stewart</strong> managed to place&nbsp;10th with about 3.5 percent approval.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most surprising outcome&nbsp;was a tie for fourth between&nbsp;<strong>Bill O'Reilly</strong> and <strong>Cornel West</strong> - two political figures who could not be any more different. Each received about 15 percent approval among 463 respondents.</p>
<h3><strong>Could the Presidential Primary Debates Need More Than a New Moderator?</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/on-cbs-democratic-debate-dips-to-8-5-million-viewers/277547" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adweek</a>, last week's Republican&nbsp;and Democratic Party debates were the least successful, in terms of viewership, since the first GOP debate on August 6.</p>

<p>It's easy to imagine&nbsp;a star-studded moderator lineup would reverse the seemingly dwindling popularity of both parties' presidential debates. A Colbert-led debate moderation panel could be the cure to slumping public interest in future Democratic and Republican debates.</p>

<p>Similarly, one of the Republican candidates, <strong>Rand Paul</strong> (R-KY), <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/11/13/capitalism-vs-socialism-rand-paul-challenges-bernie-sanders-hour-long-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenged</a> Democratic candidate <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> (I-VT) to a one-on-one style debate just last week. Whether or not Sanders will take the challenge&nbsp;has yet to be seen, but a new format for the debates alongside a new moderator could be just what the doctor ordered to cure an ailing political discourse.</p>
