<p>As early as January 2015, in interviews with <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/isis-operative-this-is-how-we-send-jihadis-to-europe#.huK9mg1kx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed</a> journalists, an ISIS operative admitted he traveled to Turkey in 2014 and settled there for the express purpose of creating a smuggling operation to sneak jihadis into Europe. Specifically, these operatives were directed to head to Sweden, Germany, and Italy to request asylum.</p>

<p>These statements were confirmed by Buzzfeed through interviews of other smugglers. As part of this report, Buzzfeed also interviewed Senate Intelligence Chairman <strong>Richard Burr</strong> and Senate Armed Services Committee member <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong>. Both Burr and Graham stated that they had been aware of Middle Eastern terrorists being smuggled into Europe, but admitted they had no idea the extent of the smuggling operation.</p>

<p>In August 2015, the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-leader-seeks-europe-fleeing-govt-jihadis-163636165.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> wrote a very flattering piece about a Syrian terrorist fighter who traveled to Europe with the refugees. This individual, <strong>Laith Al Saleh</strong>, admitted to fighting against the Syrian government and commanding a 700 strong western-backed terrorist unit against the Syrian government.</p>

<p>Commander Saleh further admitted that his cousin, a former senior officer in the Syrian Army, also became a terrorist who fought against the Syrian government and had already settled in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>On September 10, 2015, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3229134/Syrian-ISIS-suspect-sleeping-rough-Calais-refugee-camps-hope-sneaking-UK-wage-terror.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> and the French Media reported on a manhunt underway for a suspected ISIS terrorist who had smuggled himself in with the refugees and was hiding among them. Authorities believed his goal was to get to Britain to commit acts of terror.</p>

<p>Yet five days later, on September 15, 2015, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/15/what-you-need-know-about-syrian-refugee-crisis-and-what-us-doing-help" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House</a> urged Americans to support the influx of refugees from the Middle East. There is even an <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/authorize-and-resettle-syrian-refugees-us" rel="noopener noreferrer">online petition</a> set up to gather support on the White House's website.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-syrian-refugees-213860" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico </a>quoted Democratic presidential candidate <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> from her appearance on CBS's <em>Face the Nation</em> as stating:</p>
<blockquote>“We’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II...I think the United States has to do more, and I’d like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000.”</blockquote>
<p>Now, Paris has suffered a complex, well-coordinated terrorist attack that left over 100 people dead, many more wounded, and France in a state of emergency. Given the complexity and sophistication of the attacks, it was clear they were well-planned, funded, and executed. <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/322187-iraq-warned-france-terror/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iraq</a> has come forward and admitted its intelligence service previously warned France that it was being considered a primary terrorist target. Yet, it appears this intelligence was ignored.</p>

<p>Further, it now appears that the passport found on one of the terrorists' bodies, in the aftermath of the attacks, identifying the attacker as a refugee, was determined to be a <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-15/false-flag-link-passport-found-next-suicide-bomber-was-fake-claim-us-french-sources" rel="noopener noreferrer">forgery</a>. This now calls into question whether or not this terrorist attack was a false flag.</p>

<p>It's bad enough the United States has admitted to funding and providing material support to terrorists fighting the Syrian government under the guise of supporting freedom fighters; we saw how that worked out in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan. These countries are worse now than they were before the United States got involved and they've become terrorist recruiting and proving grounds.</p>

<p>Even more troubling is that the United States government has long had direct knowledge that Middle Eastern terrorists were being smuggled in with refugees from the Syrian crisis as early as January of this year, yet at almost every level, our government minimized and downplayed this risk to the American people.</p>

<p>In fact, up to these horrible terrorist attacks in Paris earlier this month, there has been little to no objective public discussion or assessment of the risks of allowing Middle Eastern terrorists asylum in the United States disguised as refugees.</p>

<p>Without such a discussion and risk assessment, it's naive to accept any more Middle Eastern refugees without a more stringent vetting process.</p>
