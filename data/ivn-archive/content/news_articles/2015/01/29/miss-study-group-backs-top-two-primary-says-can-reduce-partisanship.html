[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Taxpayer-funded&nbsp;party primaries&nbsp;may soon be a thing of the past in Mississippi, if a <p><a href="http://www.sos.ms.gov/About/Pages/Press-Release.aspx?pr=588" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent report</a> from a state-sponsored study group means anything.</p>

<p>Convened by Mississippi’s secretary of state, the 50-member panel endorsed the top-two model for primary elections in mid-January, but stopped short of backing any immediate change for fear that it could confuse election workers.</p>

<p>As a group, the panel didn’t have any formal legislative or policymaking authority, so any change in how Mississippians vote in primaries would need to come through the state Legislature.</p>

<p>Even so, their 18-page report held fast to assertions about why a top-two primary system was needed in the state, particularly startling for a jurisdiction in the South that reliably votes red at the state level.</p>

<p>For starters, the majority of the committee’s members who sided with the idea said a top-two system would favor “election results based upon the issues of the election,” breaking up areas with one-party control and bringing more moderates into the fold.</p>

<p>They also held that the shift to a top-two primary system could improve the rates at which unaffiliated minorities, young people, and veterans overseas participate in primary elections.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The shift to a top-two primary system could improve the rates at which unaffiliated minorities, young people, and veterans overseas participate in primary elections." author=""]Another factor in their endorsement: money. The report stated that funding the candidate selection process for political paprties made the current primary systems in Mississippi “expensive and inconvenient” to maintain for voters.

<p>Panelists seemed to favor the top-two model as a less expensive alternative. Their report quoted Louisiana’s election commissioner as estimating that her state pocketed $5 million in savings every two years as a result of their election&nbsp;model.</p>

<p>Much of the committee’s analysis was based on top-two primary systems that already exist in states like California, Louisiana, and Washington state, compared with the various other long-running closed, semi-closed, and open primaries in other states.</p>

<p>Mississippi technically has an open partisan primary. Voters do not have to register with a political party to participate in&nbsp;primary elections, but voters must choose between a Republican and Democratic ballot.</p>

<p>Further, a section of law says "no person shall be eligible to participate in any primary election unless he/she intends to support the nominations made in the primary in which he/she participates,” but a federal court has ruled that there is no practical way to enforce this.</p>

<p>A top-two system is different in that it&nbsp;allows all voters and candidates, regardless of party affiliation, to participate on a single ballot. Voters can cast a ballot for any candidate in any party, large or small. The top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.</p>

<p>Louisiana's election system does differ from the top-two primary models in California and Washington state. Instead of having the first round of elections&nbsp;before November, all eligible candidates and voters participate on a single ballot in November when other states hold their general elections. If a candidate gets over 50 percent of the vote, he or she&nbsp;wins the election. If no candidate receives 50 percent plus one of the vote, a runoff election is held in December between the top two vote-getters.</p>

<p>Advocates believe the top-two model&nbsp;opens up the political process and could help reduce the record-high levels of partisanship between the country’s two major parties.</p>
<h3><b>Partisan Opposition&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p>Opponents of top-two, like the 20&nbsp;committee members who voted to only make amendments to the current system, argue that allowing voters affiliated with other parties to cast ballots in a precursor to the general election could weaken party integrity.</p>

<p>Neither the Democratic nor Republican Parties&nbsp;of Mississippi seemed taken with the idea. A <a href="http://www.mpbonline.org/blogs/news/2014/10/02/election-panel-rejects-closed-party-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mississippi public broadcast station</a> quoted chairmen for both state parties as coming out against any change.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Advocates believe the top-two system opens up the political process." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295657537" handle="RyanMarcS" hashes=""]They aren’t alone. As IVN reported in a <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/05/15/bipartisanship-democratic-republican-lawyers-work-together-restrict-voting-rights/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous story</a>, Democratic and Republican Parties nationwide have fought to close or preserve already closed primaries in states like Hawaii, Idaho, and South Carolina over the last several years.</p>

<p>But it’s not just the partisan political operatives and parties raising questions about the top-two system, either.</p>

<p>Barry Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said in a <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/05/15/bipartisanship-democratic-republican-lawyers-work-together-restrict-voting-rights/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_author&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous interview</a> that there wasn’t “a consistent finding that shows these registration laws actually lead to more polarization.”</p>

<p>A report for the Midwest Political Science Association culled information from nearly 20 years of opinion polls that suggested that open primaries&nbsp;can produce more polarization than closed primaries. However,&nbsp;that same research spotted signs that political polarization had leavened in California and Louisiana.</p>

<p>The debate aside, it may be a while longer before the study receives serious consideration. Still, a change in primary election models may not be timelier, with one <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll</a> finding that a record-setting 43 percent of Americans consider themselves independent from either major party.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Mississippi’s secretary of state did not immediately return a request for comment for this story.</p>
