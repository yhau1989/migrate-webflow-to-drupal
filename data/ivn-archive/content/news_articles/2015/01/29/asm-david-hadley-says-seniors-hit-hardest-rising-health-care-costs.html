<p>California State Assemblymember&nbsp;<strong>David Hadley</strong> (R-South Bay) took office as the representative of Assembly District 66 after one of the most competitive Assembly races in California. After narrowly placing first in the 2014 top-two primary, Hadley unseated incumbent Democrat Al Muratsuchi by just 706 votes.</p>

<p>The loss of Muratsuchi's seat was one of a handful of Democratically-controlled seats that led to the loss of a supermajority in the Legislature.</p>

<p>The cost of health care will continue to be a major issue in the current legislative session. According to Hadley, seniors were the first to feel the brunt of rising&nbsp;costs.</p>

<p>In an interview for IVN, he addressed the&nbsp;issue and how the Legislature might help:</p>
<blockquote>"California is among the highest-cost states in the country – high housing costs, high sales taxes, gas taxes, taxes on insurance premiums, cap-and-trade taxes. Part of what we need to do to make California more cost-effective for seniors are policies that will benefit all Californians" - Asm. David Hadley, Assembly District 66</blockquote>
<p>Hadley argues that part of the solution is to find new opportunities where seniors can cut costs. One possibility is to broaden their ability to complete 1031 tax-free real estate exchanges. This enables someone to move into new housing and still benefit from Proposition 13, which helps keep property taxes low for long-time homeowners.</p>

[advertisement title="" type="outset"]According to the&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.chcf.org/~/media/media%20library%20files/pdf/p/pdf%20premiumratesindivmarket.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Healthcare Foundation</a>, California health insurance premiums have increased by 9.8 percent since 2011 -- a reality that is catching many seniors on a fixed income by&nbsp;surprise.</p>

<p>These costs continue to rise despite the creation of Covered California, the state-run health insurance exchange that has been in place since 2014. The program is a result of the Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in 2010.</p>

<p>Hadley, who serves as&nbsp;vice-chair of the Aging and Long-Term Care Committee, says&nbsp;Covered California isn't working.</p>

<p>"The objective of Covered California was to lower insurance costs across the board, and so far it has failed in that objective," he argues.</p>

<p>At the national level, the discussion on health care has essentially reached a standstill. Congressional Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (a full repeal, not just parts of the law) six times since it passed in 2010. However, Hadley thinks a more pragmatic approach will reap tangible results for Californians.</p>
<blockquote>"I want to work constructively with Committee Chairwoman Cheryl Brown and my fellow committee members. One way for legislators such as myself to work in a constructive and bipartisan fashion is to listen before we do too much talking." - Asm. David Hadley, Assembly District 66</blockquote>
<p>A plurality of voters in Assembly District 66 are Democratic -- 39 percent to the Republicans' 33 percent -- but there is also a sizeable group of unaffiliated voters (approximately 18%). Therefore, in order to win the election, Hadley had to appeal to voters outside his party to beat Muratsuchi&nbsp;in a district once considered safe for incumbents.</p>

<p>"I spoke to the issues that greatly concern most voters in the South Bay," Hadley said. "Like my friends and neighbors, I am focused on ensuring that our South Bay schools remain strong, and I believe in fair funding and local control for our public schools. Our district was rocked in 2014 by Toyota’s announcement that it is leaving Torrance for Texas. I will work to ensure that state policy helps businesses of all sizes grow and thrive in the state."</p>

<p>Hadley is in a position to improve the state of health care in California in&nbsp;his first term. While federal policies draw clear lines as to what can be done, California still has opportunities to ease the process of attaining proper care.</p>

<p>Making the cost of living in the state more manageable will help ease the burden of rising&nbsp;health care costs. Expect action to be taken from Hadley and the Long-Term Care Committee when this year's session gets rolling.</p>
