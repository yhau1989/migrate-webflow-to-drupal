<p>In an effort to <a href="http://www.unitedliberty.org/articles/19040-repeal-gun-free-school-zones" rel="noopener noreferrer">undo</a>&nbsp;certain gun control legislation, one Kentucky Republican with an <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/08/01/why-5-republicans-voted-not-to-sue-obama/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2013/01/20/kentucky-us-rep-thomas-massie-charts-his-own-path/" rel="noopener noreferrer">streak</a>&nbsp;may face opposition from within his own party</p>

<p>On Tuesday,&nbsp;U.S. Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr86?utm_campaign=govtrack_feed&amp;utm_source=govtrack/feed&amp;utm_medium=rss" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced</a> HR 86, the Safe Students Act. If passed, the act would repeal the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.</p>

<p>Massie issued a press release <a href="https://massie.house.gov/press-release/press-release-us-representative-massie-proposes-repeal-federal-gun-free-school-zones-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">explaining</a>&nbsp;why the bill is important:</p>
<blockquote>"Weapons bans and gun-free zones are unconstitutional. They do not and cannot prevent criminals or the mentally ill from committing acts of violence. But they often prevent victims of such violence from protecting themselves."</blockquote>
<p>So far the bill has 5&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr86?utm_campaign=govtrack_feed&amp;utm_source=govtrack/feed&amp;utm_medium=rss" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosponsors</a>, all Republicans.</p>

<p>The original <a href="http://madworldnews.com/massie-gun-free-school-zones/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gun-Free School Zones Act</a>&nbsp;"made it unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that he knew or had reasonable cause to believe was a school zone."</p>

[advertisement title="" type="outset"]However, <p><a href="http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/05/foghorn/debunking-mother-jones-10-pro-gun-myths-shot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gun-free zones</a> are unpopular with gun rights activists on the grounds that such zones do not protect the people, but advertise that they are unarmed. A report from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety, has <a href="http://everytown.org/article/schoolshootings/" rel="noopener noreferrer">determined</a>&nbsp;that there have been no fewer than 96 school shootings since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in late 2012.</p>

<p>The original Gun-Free School Zones Act was <a href="http://madworldnews.com/massie-gun-free-school-zones/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled</a> unconstitutional in 1995 as exceeding Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause. An amended version appeared in 1996, but has not been ruled on&nbsp;by the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Massie also <a href="https://massie.house.gov/press-release/press-release-us-representative-massie-proposes-repeal-federal-gun-free-school-zones" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced</a> a version of his bill in the last Congress as did former congressman Ron Paul on multiple occasions. Massie's <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr133" rel="noopener noreferrer">bill</a> died in committee.</p>

<p>Although Republicans now control both houses of Congress, Massie may still face difficulties in getting his legislation passed. Massie was a vocal opponent of Boehner's re-election as speaker and <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiedupree/status/552528386233745408" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> for Florida Republican Ted Yoho. Other members who voted against Boehner, including Daniel Webster and Richard Nugent, have already been <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/boehner-allies-out-for-revenge-114007.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed</a> from their previous posts on the Rules Committee.</p>

<p>Despite the failed efforts to elect a different speaker, Thomas Massie still defends his and his colleagues's actions.</p>

<p>"No member should be punished for voting according to his or her conscience," he <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/politics-blog/2015/01/09/massie-opposes-political-payback/21507315/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p>

<p>Massie, who also <a href="http://rare.us/story/rep-thomas-massie-reintroduces-ron-pauls-audit-the-fed-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced</a> legislation for auditing the Federal Reserve, will likely soon find out whether or not his actions&nbsp;against Boehner will&nbsp;imperil his legislative priorities.</p>
