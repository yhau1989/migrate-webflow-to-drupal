[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Indiana is one of 11&nbsp;states that still permits&nbsp;straight-ticket voting, or the ability to vote for all candidates affiliated with a particular political party by selecting a single option on the ballot. However, this&nbsp;could change with a new bill introduced in the state&nbsp;Legislature that would eliminate&nbsp;the option in most elections.

With the exception of presidential elections, House Bill 1008, authored by State Representative David Ober (R-Albion), "[r]<p><span>emoves a voter's option to vote for all candidates of a political party or an independent ticket at one</span> <span>time (straight ticket voting) in a general or municipal election."<em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p>In an<a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/indiana/GOP-led-plan--End-one-click-straight-ticket-4498548" rel="noopener noreferrer"> interview with a local&nbsp;newspaper</a>, Ober&nbsp;cited people's interest in candidates as opposed to political party to justify his legislation.</p>
<p>"We don't put donkeys or elephants on our signs anymore," he said.</p>
<p>In a separate interview with a local TV station, Ober&nbsp;also expressed his concern that straight-ticket voting prevents voters from reviewing nonpartisan referendums, such as a failed referendum to build a new middle school in his district.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="We don't put donkeys or elephants on our signs anymore" hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295657392" handle="daveober" hashes=""]House leadership has been generally supportive of the legislative measure. Speaker Brian Bosma (R) was quoted saying that both Democrats and Republicans have supported and opposed straight-ticket voting in the past, and that people should vote in accordance with a candidate's qualifications and character, as opposed to party affiliation.

<p>Party leaders on county and municipal levels are more mixed in their support for the measure. The elimination of straight-ticket voting could disadvantage both Republicans and Democrats in regions where the ballot option supposedly accounts for a significant portion of votes.</p>

<p>This claim cannot be substantiated because Indiana does not keep&nbsp;records detailing how many straight-ticket ballots are cast in each election.</p>

<p>H.B. 1008 was assigned to the&nbsp;Committee on Elections and Apportionment. If it passes the Indiana Legislature, it will come down to the decision of Republican Governor Mike Pence, a potential presidential candidate, to sign, veto, or take no action on&nbsp;the bill at all. The governor does not have to sign a bill for it to become law in Indiana; it will automatically go into effect&nbsp;after a set number of days unless it is vetoed.</p>

<p><em>Editor's note: The initial published draft said there are 6 states that allow straight-ticket voting. According to the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, the number is 11.</em></p>
