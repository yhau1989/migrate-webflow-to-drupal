<p><span>[gravityform id="40" name="Have the parties left you?" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]The two major political parties received another blow on Wednesday, as a recent <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup poll</a> revealed that a record-high number of Americans (43%) now self-identify as independent.</span></p>
<p><span>This represents a drastic increase from 2008, when 35 percent of Americans identified as independent, suggesting that the growth is not only rapid, but will continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The growth primarily comes at the expense of&nbsp;the Democratic Party, which fell from 36 percent to 30 percent in just 6&nbsp;years. Republican identification dropped from 28 percent to 26 percent in the same time period.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This should come as no surprise to voters or politicians. Americans have repeatedly made it clear that they cannot be defined as either red or blue. A majority of voters&nbsp;believe “neither party in Congress is the party of the American people,” and a&nbsp;whopping 81 percent believe that Congress is out of touch. </span></p>
<p><span>Consistently, Congress has received abysmal approval ratings from voters, reaching a low of <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/01/10/8-reasons-just-8-americans-approve-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 percent</a> in the beginning of 2014. Jon Stewart even went so far as to&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/07/jon-stewarts-comparison-congress-herpes-hilariously-accurate" rel="noopener noreferrer">compare Congress to herpes</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>And for the <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/05/poll-government-was-biggest-concern-for-americans-in-2014/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=wallpost&amp;utm_campaign=FB" rel="noopener noreferrer">first time</a> in the history of Gallup polling, government, Congress, and politicians ranked as the number one problem facing the United States in 2014.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As speculated by <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"Given historical trends, 2015 could bring a new record, as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election.”</span></p>
