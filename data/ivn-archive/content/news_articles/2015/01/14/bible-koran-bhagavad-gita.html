[advertisement title="" type="outset"]I have been surprised this week by how many of my friends and acquaintances are actually Islamic studies experts. Since the Charlie Hebdo shootings, I have talked -- online or in person -- with more than two dozen people who (by their own report) have "studied Islam carefully and know that it is a religion that can never be anything but violent."

<p>Many of these people have told me that I need to start reading books so I can stop being so wrong when I suggest that the religion of more than 1.2 billion people in the world has truth and beauty and the potential to influence its adherents for either good or bad -- just like every other religion, philosophy, or professional life coach.</p>

<p>As a sign of this expertise people have offered (as people often offer in such situations) bunches and bunches of quotes straight from the Koran -- all of them pithy, on-point proof texts that are completely devoid of context. I have my own proof-texts, of course, but they never seem to be as persuasive to people who would rather believe otherwise. That's how proof-texts work.</p>

<p>But I thought it would be worthwhile to try an experiment. Using my notes from teaching and reading all three texts over the last 20 years, I have compiled ten quotations on war and peace from three of the world's great sacred texts: the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita. The answers are on the bottom. It's the honor system, so please don't cheat.</p>

<p>These are all proof-texts, of course. They are devoid of context or explanation and exist as free-floating units of meaning that can be incorporated into any narrative one wishes to use. If you find this unfair or incoherent, well, that's kind of the point.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here are the ten passages from THE BIBLE, THE KORAN, or the BHAGAVAD GITA. Giveaway names of God (the LORD, Allah, or Krishna) have been replaced by a generic [God]. How many can you get right?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>"[God] enjoins justice, kindness and charity to one's kindred, and forbids lewdness, reprehensible conduct and oppression. He admonishes you so that you may take heed."</li>
	<li>"Anyone who would not seek [<span>God]</span> would be executed, whether they were young or old, male or female."</li>
	<li>“There is no greater good for a warrior than to fight in a righteous war. There is a war that opens the doors of heaven. . . . Happy the warriors whose fate is to fight such a war. But to forego this fight for righteousness is to forego thy duty and honor: is to fall into transgression. Men will tell of thy dishonor both now and in times to come. And to a man who is in honor, dishonor is more than death.”</li>
	<li>"When [God] brings you to the land that you are going to occupy and forces out many nations before you&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;you must utterly annihilate them. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy!"</li>
	<li>For I accept every sacrifice, and I am [God] supreme. But they know not my pure Being, and because of this they fall.”</li>
	<li>"If you do not go to war, [God] will punish you sternly, and will replace you by other men. You will in no way harm Him: for [God] has power over all things."</li>
	<li><span>"Turn away from evil and do what is right!&nbsp;</span><span><span><span>Strive for peace and promote it!"</span></span></span></li>
	<li>“In death thy glory in heaven, in victory thy glory on earth. Arise, therefore . . . with thy soul ready to fight.”</li>
	<li>"[God] does not forbid you to be kind and equitable to those who have neither made war on your religion nor driven you from your homes. God loves the equitable."</li>
	<li>"For thus says [God]:&nbsp;“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees.""</li>
