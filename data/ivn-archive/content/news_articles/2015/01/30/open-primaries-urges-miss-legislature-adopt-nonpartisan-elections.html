<p>On January 16, the Mississippi secretary of state’s 2014 Committee to Review Election Laws (CREL) issued a formal recommendation for the adoption of a nonpartisan, top-two primary election system. Should the legislature follow the advice, all Mississippi elections — including for Congress — would be conducted along nonpartisan lines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openprimaries.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Primaries</a>, a national political reform organization, is urging the Mississippi Legislature to follow the recommendation and adopt a fully open and nonpartisan election system. President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke stated:</p>
<blockquote>“There is a growing national movement in the direction of open and nonpartisan primaries. We need more competition in the political process, more inclusiveness, more debate and more voters. I hope Mississippi becomes the next state to enact this crucial reform.” - John Opdycke, Open Primaries</blockquote>
<p>The CREL was empaneled after controversy in 2014 over the Republican primary and runoff for U.S. Senate. A record number of African-Americans — who typically back Democrats — were mobilized to vote by Black leaders for incumbent Senator Thad Cochran against a far right challenger, State Senator Chris McDaniel, in the primary runoff. Any Mississippian who had not participated in the Democratic Party primary three weeks prior was eligible to vote.</p>

[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Black voters, exercising their right to mobility under the state’s current form of open primaries, were widely credited with securing the Republican nomination for Cochran. Ultra-conservative Republicans used this surge in African-American participation, and McDaniel’s subsequent defeat, to advocate for closing Mississippi’s primary system, a change that would end voter mobility altogether.

<p>The CREL recommended the adoption of nonpartisan, top-two primaries, which would give all Mississippians more access and more choice by abolishing party primaries altogether and substituting a public primary instead. The CREL rejected calls to enact a more partisan system, stating that “closed primaries discourage the youth from participating in elections and have a negative impact on voter registration and minority voters.”</p>

<p>In its support of the top-two system, the CREL credited this proposed system with allowing voters to choose candidates of different parties, and allowing campaigns to focus on issues, rather than party rhetoric.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Lenora Fulani</strong>, a national advocate for nonpartisan primaries and the first African-American to appear on the presidential ballot in all 50 states, added, “Voter mobility is an important issue for black Americans. 35% of Blacks under the age of 40 are independent, which is a huge change from a generation ago. We don’t want party membership to be a requirement for voting, and we don’t want to be locked into voting for one party. The more mobility and independence we have, the more power we have.”</p>

<p><strong>Michael Hardy</strong>, general counsel and executive vice president of the National Action Network, offered his support for the CREL recommendation as well:</p>
<blockquote>"A more perfect union means eliminating barriers that prevent any voter from exercising his or her right to participate. The Committee's recommendation to enact nonpartisan primary elections is thoughtful and I hope the legislature will carefully consider their proposals." - Michael Hardy, National Action Network</blockquote>
