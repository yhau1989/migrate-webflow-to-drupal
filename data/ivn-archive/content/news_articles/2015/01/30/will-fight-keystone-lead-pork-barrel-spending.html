[advertisement title="" type="outset"]On Monday, the Senate failed to reach cloture on the Keystone XL measure, signaling a long, bitter fight to come. With&nbsp;a 53-39 vote, cloture&nbsp;failed by 7 votes.

<p>The bitter fight was cut short on Thursday, however, when&nbsp;nine Democrats joined&nbsp;with every Republican to approve construction of the $8 billion project in a 62-36 vote. It is widely expected that once the measure is vetoed by President Obama, Senate Republicans would still need 4 votes to override the veto.</p>

<p>Energy Committee Chair&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/27/us-usa-keystone-congress-idUSKBN0KZ2MO20150127" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Murkowski</a> (R-Alaska), promised to work with Democrats on her committee to consider additional amendments that would enable a veto override.</p>

<p>"Additional amendments" is almost always code for more pork-barrel spending (appropriations targeted at specific lawmakers and their district in exchange for a political favor). So, just how much will those votes be worth in pork?</p>
<h3><strong>The Republican Pork Moratorium</strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/11/19/looking-founders-dividing-pork-barrel-spending/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republicans promised </a>to not engage in pork-barrel spending, and have more or less been able to keep that promise.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="'Additional amendments' is almost always code for more pork-barrel spending." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295657457" handle="" hashes=""]Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.) went so far as to say that pork was a gift from the Founding Fathers to ease gridlock.

<p>In practice, Reid was probably correct -- the 113th Congress had&nbsp;the lowest approval rating of any Congress because of their "<a href="http://ivn.us/2014/11/10/nothing-congress-can-tell-us-future-u-s-politics/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Nothing</a>" gridlock.&nbsp;Critical bills throughout our history (including most of the Civil Rights Acts) were passed with votes bought through pork.</p>

<p>The question now becomes, are the Republicans going to break the no-pork&nbsp;promise&nbsp;to override a presidential veto on Keystone?</p>
<h3>The Dirtier The Oil, The Dirtier The Politics</h3>
<p>In 2007, President George W. Bush signed into law the&nbsp;Energy Independence and National Security Act of 2007. This bill <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6" rel="noopener noreferrer">overwhelmingly passed</a> the House (314-100) and Senate (86-8) in an unusual show of bipartisanship.</p>

<p>Section 526 of this law bans the federal government from purchasing any fuels made with unconventional oils that are "dirtier" with emissions than conventional oil:</p>
<blockquote><em>No Federal agency shall enter into a contract for procurement&nbsp;of an alternative or synthetic fuel, including a fuel produced from&nbsp;nonconventional petroleum sources, for any mobility-related use,&nbsp;other than for research or testing, unless the contract specifies&nbsp;that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the&nbsp;production and combustion of the fuel supplied under the contract&nbsp;must, on an ongoing basis, be less than or equal to such emissions&nbsp;from the equivalent conventional fuel produced from conventional&nbsp;petroleum sources.&nbsp;</em>-- Section 526, Energy Independence and National Security Act</blockquote>
<p>The Canadian tar sands, located in&nbsp;Alberta, produce&nbsp;significantly 'dirtier' oil than conventional oil, which means that the single-biggest purchaser of oil products in the United States (the federal government) is prohibited from even buying it.</p>

<p>This, of course, is assuming that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3OMSC7eBU" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> is wrong about all of the oil going overseas.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, there has been a significant effort to try to repeal this section of the Act, at least opening the possibility of sale to the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>A Colossal Waste of Time</strong></h3>
<p>Why&nbsp;has&nbsp;the Republican-led Congress<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/07/vote-keystone-colossal-waste-time/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wasted all of this time</a>? The longer oil prices stay suppressed, the less political mileage they are going to get with potential voters by forcing the veto.</p>

<p>The American government has much better things to worry about than a Canadian company's stock price, a few dozen (if that) permanent jobs, and the dirtiest oil produced being sent overseas.</p>

<p>Perhaps they can start focusing on the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/01/14/layoffs-hit-the-oilpatch-with-worst-yet-to-come/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tens of thousands of jobs being lost</a> in America's domestic oil industry,&nbsp;and stop worrying about Canada's well-being.</p>
