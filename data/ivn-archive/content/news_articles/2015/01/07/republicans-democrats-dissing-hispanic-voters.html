[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Hispanic voters have been called the “sleeping giant.” It seems like the giant is waking up, but not necessarily in bed with either the Republican or Democratic Party. The feeling of either party not taking them seriously might be the reason why more Hispanics (or Latinos) are becoming independents (along with a variety of other reasons), following the trend of many other demographics.

<p>The Democratic Party&nbsp;has, for the most part, been the predominant party of choice for Hispanics. The Hispanic vote was discussed as one of the main reasons why President Obama (who&nbsp;supported immigration reform throughout his campaign) won the last two presidential elections.</p>

<p>Efforts by the president on&nbsp;such reform have been slim and record-breaking deportations did not help authenticate his stance.</p>

<p>To make matters more uncomfortable for Hispanics, in lieu of legislation understood to be blocked by Republicans in the U.S. House, the expected Affirmative Action to grant undocumented immigrants some relief was delayed until after the upcoming 2014 midterm elections.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="In a diverse pool of voters and issues, many are finding that being independent is the answer to their concerns." author=""]This delay was the last straw for&nbsp;many Hispanics who were already disenchanted by the lack of immigration reform or deportation relief. Many efforts and demonstrations to relieve immigrants have called Obama the “Deporter-in-Chief.”

<p>Prominent Hispanic advocacy groups have long criticized Republicans for not taking the issue or them seriously, but what has taken center stage is their discontent toward the president and Democrats in general to the point&nbsp;that it has damaged any notion of unconditional support. Hispanic voters are showing that they are more independent than either Democrats or Republicans believe.</p>

<p>The president's recent executive order&nbsp;has helped restore relationships and although Immigration might not be the deal breaker issue, it has left a sour taste in the mouths of many Hispanic voters, some of whom are now&nbsp;rushing for alternative political options.</p>

<p>In a diverse pool of voters and issues, many are finding that being independent is the answer to their concerns. For many, it is simply a way to persuade all political parties and to let&nbsp;them know that their vote and support is not to be taken for granted. Hispanic voters are no different.</p>
