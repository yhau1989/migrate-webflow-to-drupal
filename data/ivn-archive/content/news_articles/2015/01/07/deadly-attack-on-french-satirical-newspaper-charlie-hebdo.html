<p>On Wednesday morning, three gunmen forcibly entered the Paris newsroom of french satirist magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12, including the paper's editor, Stephan Charbonnier,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30710883" rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to the BBC. As of Wednesday evening GMT, the gunmen had not been captured and the search by French authorities continues.</p>

<p>Early reports indicate the gunmen were armed with automatic weapons and forced entry to the office building where the editorial staff was conducting its daily meeting. During the escape, the gunmen fled in a black car and hijacked another shortly thereafter.</p>
