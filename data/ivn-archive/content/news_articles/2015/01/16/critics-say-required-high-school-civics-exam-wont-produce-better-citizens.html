[advertisement title="" type="outset"]On Thursday, Arizona became&nbsp;the first state in the U.S. to pass a law requiring high school students to <p><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/01/15/arizona-passes-law-requiring-students-pass-civics-test/21830955/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pass a civics exam</a> before graduating.&nbsp;Lawmakers who support the bill say students don't know enough about basic government, but would requiring such a test actually have the desired effect of producing better citizens?</p>

<p>The American Civics Act will require students to pass&nbsp;60 out of the 100 questions on the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization civics test. The bill will likely be the&nbsp;quickest piece of legislation to pass both chambers of the Arizona Legislature and be signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey -- going through the entire legislative process in a single day.</p>

<p>Implementation of the law, however, will not be immediate.&nbsp;The class of 2017 will be the first to have to prove they know the history and workings of the U.S. government before they can receive their diplomas.</p>

<p>"Requiring that students pass this test is not by any means a silver bullet, but I think is a step, a small step forward," Republican Senate Majority Leader Steve Yarbrough&nbsp;said. "And I think we need to encourage the people of America to become more aware of the values of America."</p>

<p>However, opponents of the bill say&nbsp;passing this test doesn't automatically produce better citizens. Along with the additional costs to the state, a major concern is that knowing the answers to questions on a civics test isn't the same as getting students more engaged in their communities and in the political process, nor does it encourage critical thinking.</p>

<p>Sixty percent is not much of a passing grade and it only requires&nbsp;rote memorization from students.</p>

<p>The 60 percent threshold is the same passing grade immigrants seeking citizenship need when taking the naturalization test. The difference is that high school students are given a little more room for error and will be better prepped.&nbsp;Those who take the naturalization test are given&nbsp;<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/01/15/arizona-passes-law-requiring-students-pass-civics-test/21830955/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 questions</a>&nbsp;from the list of 100 and have to get 6 of them correct to pass the civics portion.</p>

<p>The North Dakota House of Representatives passed a similar bill on Thursday, but it did not move through the legislative process as quickly. The&nbsp;Scottsdale-based <a href="http://www.joefossinstitute.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Foss Institute</a> is heavily pushing these laws and has set a goal for all 50 states to pass&nbsp;it by 2017 -- the 230th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>Though reports are conflicting, it is expected that between 15 and 18 state legislatures will consider similar legislation in 2015.</p>
