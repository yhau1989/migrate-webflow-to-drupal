[gravityform id="69" name="Cuba US relations reinstated" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]The possibility of renewed U.S.-Cuba relations makes one wonder something about history: has opening up a communist country's market led to more freedom for its citizens?

<p><a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/22/Cuba-Numbers-What-You-Need-Know" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Cuba by the Numbers: What You Need to Know">The Fiscal Times</a> claims that new interaction with Cuba could result in over $4 billion worth of exports from the U.S. to Cuba. This is a large increase in products going into Cuba's economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/international/227813-rubio-continues-charge-against-cuba-decision" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Rubio Blasts Obama's Cuba Decision">U.S. Senator Marco Rubio</a> (R-Fla.) has suggested that there is an issue with growing Cuba’s economy through renewed U.S.-Cuba relations. He claimed that it may only enrich the Castro government rather than weaken it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the White House recently made a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/foreign-policy/cuba" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Charting a New Course on Cuba">statement</a> advocating for renewed U.S.-Cuba relations. It suggested that making more American products available in Cuba might “make it easier for Cuban citizens to have access to certain lower-priced goods to improve their living standards and gain greater economic independence from the state.”</p>

<p>President Obama seems to believe that increases in economic activity could increase freedom for Cubans, even if it is only economic freedom.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freedomhouse.org/blog/twenty-five-years-freedom-central-europe-faces-new-threats#.VKqsFqYhxpl" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Twenty-Five Years On, Freedom in Central Europe Faces New Threats">Freedom House</a> notes that the former Central European Soviet countries experienced “an immediate embrace of free-market principles” in the late 1900s after the fall of the Berlin Wall. They then “moved quickly to build stable democracies.” This could show that creating a more open economy can diminish the&nbsp;influence communism has in a country.</p>

<p><span>But Dr. Brad Epperly</span>, a Political Science professor at the University of South Carolina,<span> stated that the European situation was different because, among other things, there were many "differences in the Cold War-era world" from today. This and the fact that Cuba is not very influential on the world stage</span>&nbsp;"i<span>s why even Nixon's opening with the People's Republic of China is probably not a good analogy" for renewed U.S.-Cuba relations.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps Cuba's future is unpredictable even though there are modern historical examples. This leaves predictions about the outcomes of renewed U.S.-Cuba relations to pure speculation.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain though: the U.S. embargo on Cuba "<span>has been completely unsuccessful,</span>" according to Dr. Epperly. The only way for the U.S. to help Cubans gain their freedom, it seems, is to try another strategy.</p>
