[advertisement title="" type="outset"]In 2010, California's budget negotiations stalled for over three months past the constitutional deadline. Partisan gridlock <p><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article2608721.html#storylink=cpy" rel="noopener noreferrer">muddied the debate</a> over how to manage the state's $60 billion deficit and spending per student in California ranked 46th in the nation,&nbsp;according to the <a href="http://www.cbp.org/pdfs/2011/111012_Decade_of_Disinvestment_%20SFF.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Budget Project</a>. At the time, 80 percent of California voters said the state&nbsp;was on the wrong track.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, voters made a number of changes in Sacramento: Governor Jerry Brown took office in 2011; voters approved a law that&nbsp;allowed the Legislature to pass a budget with a simple-majority vote, instead of a two-thirds vote; California's nonpartisan, top-two primary was passed by a majority of voters under Proposition 14; and new electoral maps were drawn up by an independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. Five years later, California's budget is showing a surplus, and spending per pupil is on track to return to pre-recession levels.</p>

<p>The Legislative Analyst's Office <a href="http://lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/budget/overview/budget-overview-2015.aspx#Executive_Summary" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a>, "The state has made significant progress in addressing the wall of debt, including this budget’s anticipated elimination of all remaining school payment deferrals."</p>

<p>Assemblymember <strong>Cheryl Brown</strong> (D-San Bernadino), serving her second term in the Legislature, says investing in education is the key to a healthy budget.</p>

<p>“It is important that we continue to invest in our schools," she said in an interview for IVN. "Education is the best investment that communities can make to help businesses grow.”</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Education is the best investment that communities can make to help businesses grow." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295657824" handle="asmcherylbrown" hashes=""]She argues that if&nbsp;more students graduate from high school, they are more likely to get jobs at&nbsp;small businesses within the community. Brown identified increased funding for K-12 education as one of the biggest priorities to be addressed in the upcoming budget.

<p>California’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/budget/overview/budget-overview-2015.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that Governor Brown’s 2015-2016 budget proposal will result in a total of $7.8 billion in new funds for schools and community colleges under the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee. This means that under the governor's&nbsp;budget there will be a $640 (7.2 percent) per student increase, totaling $9,571 per student in the next fiscal year.</p>

<p>Passed by voters in 1988, <a href="http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 98</a> is dedicated to K-12 schools and community colleges, allowing the state to invest in funding to better prepare students for college and a future&nbsp;career.</p>

<p>How legislators work together during the budgeting process has a big impact on what goes into the budget -- or doesn't go into it. For Cheryl Brown, the budgeting process is a reminder of her former career as a<a href="http://asmdc.org/members/a47/about/biography" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;journalist</a>, serving as a television talk-show host for 12 years on local access television, KCSB Channel 3, and appearing as a guest on <em>Burden of Proof</em>, MSNBC, <em>The Brian Williams Show</em>, and KTTV FOX 11 News.</p>

<p>“We have to take into consideration all factions. It’s like being a journalist and in writing stories; it is important to identify all the information so that you write stories that are fair," she said. "You are like a judge; you have to look at both sides of an issue and know that people are affected by your decisions."</p>

<p>For Brown, education is the top budget issue in 2015 because she <a href="http://www.fontanaheraldnews.com/opinion/article_e5da6d64-9cd6-11e4-bbf3-47c4e8fd3046.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">believes</a> that "by allocating more resources to K-12 education, the state is taking the critical first step to ending the school-to-prison pipeline that is all too common in disadvantaged communities."</p>
