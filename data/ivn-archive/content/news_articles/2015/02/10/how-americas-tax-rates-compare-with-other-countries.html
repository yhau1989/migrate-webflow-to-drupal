<p>On December 16, 1773, a group of colonists dressed as Indians boarded three British cargo ships to destroy 342 cases of tea -- a "tea party" over a <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/12/02/looking-founders-taxation-representation/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">90 percent tax cut</a>.</p>

<p>Tea throughout the Empire had been taxed at 30-pence a pound, which had been reduced to 3-pence a pound in the colonies to combat sluggish sales and smuggling. But that wasn't good enough; we wanted tax-free tea.</p>

<p>From the very beginnings of the Republic, Americans have hated taxes. Looking at modern political discourse, one would think that we have a hefty burden in the United States, but how do we stack up against our neighbors worldwide?</p>
<h3><strong>Where Does the Federal Revenue Come From?</strong></h3>
<p>The revenue of the federal government is derived from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2014/02/06/individual-income-taxes-may-soon-generate-half-of-all-federal-tax-revenue/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 primary sources</a>: personal income taxes (47.4%), corporate income taxes (34.1%), social insurance taxes (9.9%), and others taxes, including things like tariffs, gas taxes, sin taxes, and fees (8.5%).</p>

<p>This is an important distinction to make, mainly that personal income and social insurance taxes (both based on personal incomes) drives the federal revenues.</p>

<p>The total <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-budget-deficit-in-2014-narrows-to-lowest-level-in-six-years-1413385493" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal revenue</a> in 2014 was $3.02 trillion, on a <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDP</a> of $17.7 trillion.</p>
<h3><strong>Personal Income Tax + Social Insurance Taxes</strong></h3>
<p>When the average person talks about taxes (at least federal taxes), they are usually talking about income and social security taxes -- the taxes that come out of their paychecks.</p>

<p>When comparing these types of taxes, probably the best source to turn to is the&nbsp;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a href="http://oecd.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD</a>), which has recorded member data since 1960.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The total federal revenue in 2014 was $3.02 trillion, on a GDP of $17.7 trillion." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295657890" handle="" hashes=""]Of the <p><a href="http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">34-member nations</a>, almost all are industrial nations with stable economies -- countries like France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.</p>

<p>In an attempt to compare realistic, proportional numbers, the OECD develops data comparing the taxes paid as a percentage of the country's total GDP.</p>

<p>By this measure, America has the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/how-low-are-us-taxes-compared-to-other-countries/267148/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth lowest</a>&nbsp;tax rate of the 34 members.</p>

<p>Statistics can always be deceiving; a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/america-taxes-charts-2013-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">different report</a> looked at the effective tax rates including income and social taxes of people making $100,000 and $300,000 a year.</p>

<p>Comparing 114 countries (leaving out most undeveloped nations), the United States had the fifty-fifth&nbsp;highest tax rate for $100,000/year and the fifty-third&nbsp;highest tax rate for $300,000/year.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Out of 114 countries, the US had the 55th highest tax rate for $100K/year -- 53rd for $300K." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295657890" handle="" hashes=""]The highest tax rate was Belgium, topping 47 percent, while the lowest was Macau at just under 5 percent. America's tax rate placed it beside Australia and Syria, with almost all of Europe higher than America's effective tax rate of about 25 percent at $100,000 of income.

<p>Of course, Americans pay state, sales, and property taxes, but even compared worldwide, these taxes are fairly low.</p>

<p>The VAT tax in Europe, a sales/consumption tax, is over 20 percent throughout the EU, over twice as high as the highest state sales tax in America of 9.45 percent (<a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-and-local-sales-tax-rates-2014" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennessee</a>). With the exception of a few tourist destinations, the highest combined state and local taxes are&nbsp;surprisingly in some of the most "anti-tax" states, with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom&amp;tmp=detail&amp;articleID=3950" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louisiana</a>, <a href="http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/07/alabama_gov_robert_bentley_con.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alabama</a>, Colorado, New York, and <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2012/05/18/kansas-and-oklahoma-income-tax-cuts-wont-reach-zero" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oklahoma</a> rounding out the top 5.</p>

<p>Americans, compared to our worldwide neighbors, pay a pretty low tax rate. However, much of the political argument at home isn't about how we compare with our neighbors, but how we compare with each other.</p>
<h3><strong>A Nation of Makers and Takers?</strong></h3>
<p>In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney created a firestorm when he stated that 47 percent of Americans don't pay any federal income tax.</p>

<p>Romney was effectively trying to exploit the common belief that we are a nation of makers and takers -- those who create for the system and those who only deplete it.</p>

<p>Romney was factually correct in his numbers, but the causes of this are from an interesting phenomenon highlighted in a&nbsp;short video by the Tax Policy Center. (see video)</p>

<p>While this debate will probably never be resolved--one essential fact remains. People of all income brackets make up the 47-percent of non-taxpayers.</p>

<p>It isn't just the poor leeching off of society or the rich skirting taxes; the 47 percent is made up of an incredibly economically-diverse group of Americans.</p>

<p>There is always room for improvement in our taxation system. From simplification to greater equity (however equity is defined), we can always build at better system, but with a catch.</p>

<p>Improving the taxation system can't be just a code word for advancing partisan policies.</p>

<p>Americans are always going to hate taxes; it's in our very nature. But at some point, we have to accept that we can actually have "<a href="http://ivn.us/2014/12/02/looking-founders-taxation-representation/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=image&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxation with representation</a>" and come together to design a functional, equitable tax system that truly represents the values of our republic.</p>
