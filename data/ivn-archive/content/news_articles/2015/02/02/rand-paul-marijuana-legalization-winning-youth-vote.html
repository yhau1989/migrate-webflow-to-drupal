[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Last week, the Boston Globe <p><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/02/01/tumultuous-four-years-phillips-academy-helped-shape-jeb-bush/q6ccyHNOtP1n6kqDokMBfK/story.html?event=event25" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>&nbsp;that former Florida Governor <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> smoked marijuana as a teenager at prep school. The report resulted in Sen. <strong>Rand Paul</strong>, a potential presidential rival to Bush,&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/231351-rand-paul-slams-bush-hypocrisy-on-pot" rel="noopener noreferrer">replying</a>, "This is a guy who now admits he smoked marijuana but he wants to put people in jail who do." The exchange may indicate more than a moment of intra-party politics, but a potential opening to alter the coalitions of both parties.</p>

<p>Following the 2012 elections, stories circulated about what Republicans could do to compensate for various electoral gaps: youth, gender, race. Attempts at reversing these trends have led down perilous paths, as was the case for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio after a disastrous attempt at reforming immigration.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama altered the 2012 race when he formally announced his support for gay marriage after several years of opposing it. Some Republicans have voiced <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2014/10/185584-9-prominent-republicans-who-support-gay-marriage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a> for gay marriage, such as U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio) and former Governor Jon Huntsman (Utah). However, this has made little impact in a party with a large evangelical <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-poll-gay-marriage-105886.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian base</a>, for&nbsp;whom support for gay marriage and abortion rights is anathema.</p>

<p>With Democrats currently holding advantages over Republicans with youth voters and other demographics, the GOP may have few options to gain electoral parity without alienating significant portions of its own base.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.iop.harvard.edu/political-issue-marijuana" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a> showing 18- to 29-year-olds supporting some form of legalization, reform of marijuana laws may provide an opening for Republicans where other issues have proved elusive.</p>

<p>Like some other Republicans, Paul has alluded to marijuana usage in his past. In 2014, in response to whether he used marijuana in college, the senator <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/231351-rand-paul-slams-bush-hypocrisy-on-pot" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a>, "I can say that I made mistakes when I was a kid."</p>

<p>Prior to his election, President Obama voiced <a href="http://www.esquire.com/the-side/richardson-report/obama-marijuana-legalization-122308" rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a> for marijuana decriminalization, and many pro-legalization activists hoped this signaled an end to the war on drugs. Since then, however, the Obama administration has sent mixed signals by <a href="http://www.mpp.org/media/press-releases/obama-administration.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing spending</a> on the war on drugs while&nbsp;seeking the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/holder-mandatory-minimums/" rel="noopener noreferrer">elimination of mandatory minimum sentences</a>.</p>

<p>Although still holding a sizable advantage with young voters, Obama lost 6&nbsp;percent of the youth vote in 2012 compared to 2008. The youth vote fell <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-young-voter-turnout-in-2014/" rel="noopener noreferrer">even lower</a> in 2014.</p>

<p>The effort to reform drug laws does have support within the GOP. In Jeb Bush's home state of Florida, a Republican state senator recently <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/26/florida-medical-marijuana_n_6549156.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced a bill</a> that would allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana&nbsp;for a broader list of afflictions. However, since his time as governor, Bush has&nbsp;<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/15/jeb-bush-opposes-florida-medical-marijuana-ballot-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed</a> all efforts to relax <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">drug</a> laws.</p>

<p>Other potential Republican presidential candidates have articulated personal stances&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/marijuana-gop-114786.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">against legalization</a>. Governors Scott Walker (Wisconsin) and Chris Christie (New Jersey) have both voiced opposition to marijuana legalization. Another potential candidate, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, has <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/marijuana-gop-114786.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> the Obama administration's refusal to uphold federal drug laws as "fundamentally dangerous to the liberty of the people."</p>

<p>Rand Paul has not come out for full-fledged marijuana legalization, but he has <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/11/unlikely-alliance-cory-booker-rand-paul-push-criminal-justice-reform/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=featured&amp;utm_content=title&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked</a> with Democratic U.S. Sen. Cory Booker to reform drug sentencing. However, in castigating fellow Republicans for holding a hypocritical attitude on the matter, he is in a better position than his rivals to maneuver from simply reforming the drug war to ending a prohibition that could shake up 2016.</p>
