[advertisement title="" type="outset"]The United States' tradition for expensive warfare continues. According to&nbsp;a <p><a href="http://mercatus.org/publication/wars-middle-east-have-cost-taxpayers-almost-17-trillion" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University on January 21,&nbsp;funding commitments for the global "war on terror" have cost the United States about $1.7 trillion since September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;examination of federal defense spending cites a&nbsp;report filed by the <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressional Research Service</a>, which shows that the U.S. government spent $1.6 trillion&nbsp;up to FY 2014 on Iraq, Afghanistan, and other military operations overseas.&nbsp;The war funding approved by Congress for FY 2015 bumps the total up to $1.7 trillion.</p>

<p>According to Congress' report, the money is earmarked for&nbsp;"military operations, base support, weapons maintenance, training of Afghan and Iraq security forces, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs, and veterans’ health care for the war operations."</p>

<p>As the United States engages new threats in the Middle East, like the Islamic State, President Obama has asked Congress to increase the total defense budget by <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-docs-obama-request-big-pentagon-budget-hike-223814517--politics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$38 billion</a> -- pushing total annual defense spending to $534 billion. However, these numbers may change slightly when the proposed budget comes out on Monday.</p>

<p>The "war on terror" is one of the most expensive war efforts in the history of the United States. The Iraq War, on its own, cost $694 billion.</p>

<p>To put this amount in context, the Vietnam War (minus benefit claims from veterans) cost the defense department&nbsp;between <a href="http://thevietnamwar.info/how-much-vietnam-war-cost/" rel="noopener noreferrer">$140 billion</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/life_08.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$173 billion</a>. When adjusted for inflation, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/11/nation/na-iraq-vietnam11" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vietnam cost about $686 billion</a>. However, America's efforts in the Middle East are still dwarfed by the size and scope&nbsp;of World War II, which cost approximately $4 trillion when adjusted for inflation.</p>

<p>Reigning in war spending has been a difficult task&nbsp;for the government, despite current measures in place like sequestration cuts. However, Veronique&nbsp;de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University and the&nbsp;study's author,&nbsp;says voters are often not given the whole story&nbsp;when federal officials discuss war funding.</p>

<p>"Looking at the cost of the post-9/11 wars is important because policymakers have a habit of citing the Pentagon’s base budget, which excludes war funding, when debating and discussing funding for national defense," writes de Rugy. "But, as I discuss in a <a href="http://mercatus.org/publication/defense-funding-extends-beyond-pentagon-s-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate chart</a>, using base Department of Defense figures severely understates the total cost to taxpayers for national defense."</p>

<p>She further explains that lawmakers utilize certain tricks to evade the&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41965.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Control Act of 2011</a>, which sets caps on spending and calls for a balanced budget. According to de Rugy, Overseas Contingency Operations (OCOs)&nbsp;are frequently&nbsp;used&nbsp;to make missions&nbsp;exempt from the&nbsp;spending caps.</p>

<p>"Policymakers have been rightly criticized for evading the caps by designating funds as OCO that should arguably be in the Pentagon’s base budget," she writes.</p>

<p>Now, the&nbsp;Republican-controlled Congress reportedly wants to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/republicans-will-have-hard-time-reversing-military-sequestration-even-majority-1725036" rel="noopener noreferrer">lift these spending caps</a>&nbsp;for defense and take a harder look at domestic spending cuts.</p>

<p>Domestic spending — including Medicaid and Social Security — accounts for a hefty part of the 2015 budget. In 2013, Medicaid and Social Security each&nbsp;accounted for almost <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=1258" rel="noopener noreferrer">a quarter of the government's spending</a>, according to the Center on Budget and Policy&nbsp;Priorities.</p>

<p>The mandatory entitlements will also increase in the 2015 budget, but only <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2015/assets/28_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">marginally</a>. For example, $857 billion was spent on Social Security in 2014, and the projected 2015 cost will fall somewhere&nbsp;between $892 and $903 billion.</p>

<p>The lingering issue&nbsp;is&nbsp;not only whether or not Congress and the White House can agree on a budget, but what this agreement will look like. When weighing war funding with domestic spending, policymakers need to reflect on what exactly we are spending money on and if it is worth the price taxpayers are paying for it.</p>
