[advertisement title="" type="outset"]<p><strong>NORTH CAROLINA</strong> -- Not more than a few weeks into the new Congress, one independent member of the GOP is already facing the likelihood of a primary challenger.</p>

<p>Roll Call <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/walter-jones-taylor-griffin-primary-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that U.S. Rep. <strong>Walter Jones</strong>&nbsp;(R-N.C.) is likely to face a well-funded primary challenge for the second consecutive election. Jones' 2014 <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/24/independent-republican-walter-jones-faces-tough-primary-challenge-n-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer">opponent</a>, consultant and former aide to George W. Bush, Taylor Griffin, has not announced a run yet. However, "nearly a half-dozen Tar Heel GOP operatives . . . said they expect Griffin to challenge Jones again in 2016." Furthermore, sources said "a second meeting of Jones and Griffin will be different."</p>

<p>In the 2014 contest, Griffin focused on supposed ideological deviations and <a href="http://www.taylorgriffin.org/walter-jones-pro-obama-republican-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer">assailed</a> Jones as the "most pro-Obama Republican in the House." Jones <a href="http://enr.ncsbe.gov/ElectionResults/?election_dt=05/06/2014" rel="noopener noreferrer">won</a> the primary 51-45 before decisively winning the general election. Despite the tactic, OpenCongress.org reports that Jones still <a href="https://www.opencongress.org/people/show/400209_Walter_Jones" rel="noopener noreferrer">votes</a> with his party 80 percent of the time.</p>

<p>More than $1 million from outside groups was spent on behalf of Jones' opponent that year. A "<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/04/01/israel-group-drops-brutal-ad-attacking-walter-jones/" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-figure</a>" ad sponsored by a group called the Emergency Committee for Israel ran a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec_MeIwci7k" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial</a> criticizing Jones' refusal to vote for sanctions on Iran while showing images of American and Israeli flags burning.</p>

<p>Despite the 2014 primary scare, Jones has not backed away from controversy. In addition to frequently voting against his party, Jones is also a leader in the effort to <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/09/08/rep-walter-jones-leads-effort-declassify-full-911-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">declassify</a> 28 redacted pages of the <a href="http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/232769-lawmaker-declassify-28-page-9-11-report" rel="noopener noreferrer">9/11 Report</a>.</p>

<p>After his 2014 primary victory, Jones <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/03/walter-jones-north-carolina_n_6090966.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> his political independence:</p>
<blockquote>"When my party is right, I vote with my party. When they are not, I don't vote with them. . . . That's what gets me in trouble in primaries." - U.S. Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.)</blockquote>
<p>Jones has represented his district since first winning office in 1994 when he switched to the GOP after serving as a Democrat in the North Carolina House of Representatives. A prospective 2016 match between Jones and any other opponent may resemble the 2014 contest.</p>

<p>Jones, a pro-lifer, has spoken <a href="http://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-votes-defund-obama%E2%80%99s-amnesty-illegals" rel="noopener noreferrer">against</a> President Obama's executive order on amnesty as well as government-managed <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/12/09/ron-paul-walter-jones-write-letter-opposing-obamas-nafta-style-korea-free-trade-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">trade</a> deals. In a conservative district where Obama barely surpassed <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections#" rel="noopener noreferrer">40 percent</a> in either election, any primary opponent will have few foundations from which to attack Jones. The basis of such a campaign will likely concentrate on Jones' divergent foreign policy views.</p>

<p>Representing a district that houses Camp LeJeune Marine base, Walter Jones has taken a political risk in consistently opposing military interventions. So far, it has not hampered his electoral success. However, one GOP operative <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/walter-jones-taylor-griffin-primary-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">warns</a> that if Griffin runs, he will perform better than in 2014, saying, "he's been building an organization," and getting "better at retail politics."</p>
