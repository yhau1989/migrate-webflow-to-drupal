<h3><strong>The Charge of the American Patriots</strong></h3>
<p>2016, 2016,</p>
<p>2016 onward,</p>
<p>All on the American stage</p>
<p>Rode the five hundred.</p>
<p>"Forward, the Patriots!"</p>
<p>"Charge to save the Country!" he said:</p>
<p>Onto the American scene</p>
<p>Rode the five hundred.</p>

<p>"Forward, the Patriots!"</p>
<p>No man or woman dismayed</p>
<p>The risks they all knew</p>
<p>For the Country must be saved:</p>
<p>Theirs not to make reply,</p>
<p>Theirs not to reason why,</p>
<p>Theirs but to do and die:</p>
<p>Onto the American stage</p>
<p>Rode the five hundred.</p>

<p>Political corruption to right of them,</p>
<p>Special Interest to left of them,</p>
<p>Congress in front of them</p>
<p>Volleyed and thundered;</p>
<p>Stormed at with shot and shell,</p>
<p>Boldly they rode and well,</p>
<p>Into the jaws of Death,</p>
<p>Into the mouth of Hell</p>
<p>Rode the five hundred.</p>

<p>Flashed all their sabers bare,</p>
<p>Flashed as they turned in air,</p>
<p>Sabering the corruption there,</p>
<p>Charging a once cherished Institution, while</p>
<p>All the world wondered:</p>
<p>Plunged in the backroom smoke</p>
<p>Right through the aisle they broke;</p>
<p>Democrat and Republican</p>
<p>Reeled from the sabre stroke</p>
<p>Shattered and sundered.</p>
<p>They continued to ride on</p>
<p>All the five hundred.</p>

<p>Political corruption to right of them,</p>
<p>Special Interest to left of them,</p>
<p>Congress in front of them</p>
<p>Volleyed and thundered;</p>
<p>Stormed at with shot and shell,</p>
<p>While Democrats and Republicans fell,</p>
<p>The Country that had placed its faith well</p>
<p>Came through the jaws of Death</p>
<p>Back from the mouth of Hell,</p>
<p>All that was left then,</p>
<p>Were the five hundred.</p>

<p>O the wild charge they made!</p>
<p>Their glory will never fade</p>
<p>With the country in wonder.</p>
<p>Honor the charge they made,</p>
<p>Honor the American Patriots,</p>
<p>Noble five hundred.</p>
