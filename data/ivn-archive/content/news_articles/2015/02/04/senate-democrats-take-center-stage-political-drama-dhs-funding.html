[advertisement title="" type="outset"]On Tuesday, Senate Democrats successfully filibustered an appropriations bill that would fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security until September. The bill, passed by the U.S. House on <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2015/01/14/immigration-amendments-set-stage-another-eleventh-hour-spending-showdown/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14</a>, includes provisions that threaten President Barack Obama's executive actions on deferred deportations for certain immigrants who are in the country illegally.</p>

<p>A funding bill for DHS must pass by February 27 or agencies including the TSA, Secret Service, and Customs and Border Protection will partially shutdown.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans failed to pass a motion to proceed on the House bill in a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00051" rel="noopener noreferrer">51-48 vote</a>, 9 votes shy of the 60 needed to end a filibuster. All 44 Democrats, both independents, and two Republicans voted "Nay."</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was among the nay votes, but according to <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/231616-immigration-bill-stalls-in-senate" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a>, he changed his vote so he could bring the legislation back to the floor. Illinois Republican Mark Kirk was the only Republican who objected to proceeding with the bill.</p>

<p>It is not clear what McConnell's next move will be. He could bring the bill up for a vote again, which House conservatives want him to do; however, any bill that reverses the president's actions on immigration will not likely survive in the Senate as long as the Democrats have the numbers needed to preserve a filibuster. Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/dhs-bill-democrats-filibuster-114870.html?hp=t1_r" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that Republicans cannot yet reach a consensus on where to go from here.</p>

<p>February 27 is still over three weeks away, but the Senate could have taken this up in mid-January, giving both sides over a month to work out some sort of deal. Instead, McConnell held off, creating another eleventh hour funding showdown between Republicans and Democrats. House conservatives will not be happy with a "clean" DHS funding bill and Senate Democrats will not even give the president an opportunity to get out the veto pen if the legislation is not changed.</p>

<p>Congress may have a different makeup, but the way it conducts its business looks very similar to the 113th Congress, leading many to believe that nothing has really changed on Capitol Hill.</p>
