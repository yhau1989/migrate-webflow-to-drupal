<blockquote>“History has shown that it is not good for a Democracy when the executive branch has sweeping surveillance powers.” –Andrew Crocker, EFF</blockquote>
<p>Since 2002, over <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/surveillance-suits" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="40 cases">40 cases</a> have been brought against U.S. administrations <a href="http://johnjayresearch.org/ccs/2014/02/23/substantive-challenges-in-the-united-states-to-nsa-surveillance/#B5" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="concerning">concerning</a> mass surveillance. Many have been brought by civil liberties&nbsp;groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/nsa-documents-search" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="EFF">EFF</a>). Most cases have been dismissed, but legislation seems to be responding to concerns, even though the courts have not.</p>

<p>“We are working on this from more than one side," said Andrew Crocker, a&nbsp;legal fellow at EFF, in an interview for IVN.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Tearing Holes in the Constitution</strong></h3>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="timeline">timeline</a> from EFF, the first spying order under the Bush administration was drafted in 2001&nbsp;by David Addington, council to Vice President Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>In a declaration for EFF's <em>Jewel v. NSA</em> case, former senior analyst at the NSA, <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/wiebe-declaration-support-plaintiffs-motion" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="J. Kirk Wiebe">J. Kirk Wiebe</a>, said that after 9-11, "The individual liberties preserved in the U.S. Constitution were no longer a consideration [at the NSA].”</p>

<p>So far, three courts (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-v-nsa-challenge-illegal-spying" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Diggs">Diggs</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-nsas-collecting-of-phone-records-is-likely-unconstitutional/2013/12/16/6e098eda-6688-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Leon">Leon</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/national-security-letters-are-unconstitutional-federal-judge-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Illston">Illston</a>) and the Presidential Civil Liberties and Oversight Board (<a href="http://www.pclob.gov/library/Semi_Annual_Report-Sept2014.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="PCLOB">PCLOB</a>) have ruled that some of the NSA’s spying is unconstitutional. Many plaintiffs have filed for <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/injunction" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="injunctions">injunctions</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/declaratory_judgment" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="declalatory relief">declaratory relief</a>, and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/damages" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="damages">damages</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Legal Conundrums</strong></h3>
<p>Main concerns come from individuals, reporters, scholars, lawyers, and nonprofit organizations who have sensitive conversations with people outside of the U.S. They claim NSA spying programs have had a&nbsp;"chilling effect" on their rights to speak and associate freely.</p>

<p>Verizon and AT&amp;T were also sued on privacy grounds for releasing customer information to the government. In 2008, those cases were dismissed with the passage of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/summary" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="FISA Amendments Act">FISA Amendment Act</a>, which gave immunity to companies working with the NSA.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The individual liberties preserved in the U.S. Constitution were no longer a consideration (at the NSA)." author="J. Kirk Wiebe, former NSA analyst"]Most cases have been dismissed on lack of standing because no one can prove that they were surveilled, even though the government has <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="government admitted">admitted</a>&nbsp;to doing so in the press. Even after the Edward Snowden leaks, cases have hit the same brick walls and legal conundrums.</p>

<p>Citizens can file Freedom of Information Act requests to find out if they have been surveilled. However, the government often claims <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/state-secrets-privilege" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="State Secrecy">state secrecy</a>, dismissing these cases, even if they have standing, to prevent revealing that people are -- or are not -- &nbsp;being surveilled. The government claims either admission is a threat to national security.</p>

<p>The government also consistently claims <a href="http://harpers.org/blog/2009/04/obamas-national-security-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="sovereign immunity">sovereign immunity</a>, meaning one cannot sue the government, unless the government gives jurisdiction over itself. Government officials&nbsp;are also immune, unless the accused is working completely outside his or her job description.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/imported_files/training/programs/legal-division/downloads-articles-and-faqs/research-by-subject/miscellaneous/ForeignIntelligenceSurveillanceAct.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The FISA Act 1978">The FISA Act of 1978</a> was meant to be the exclusive legal authority on spying to&nbsp;reign in the executive snooping of the 60s and 70s. The law only specifically waves state immunity for 3 sections of the law: 106(a), 305(a), 405(a). These&nbsp;sections address warrants, notification of surveillance, and use of information. Patrick Toomey of the ACLU says they have not sued under these sections.</p>

<p>"They are very narrowly defined," he said.</p>

<p>In EFF's case,&nbsp;<em>Jewel v. NSA</em>, the court <a href="http://ia601403.us.archive.org/22/items/gov.uscourts.cand.207206/gov.uscourts.cand.207206.148.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="reasoned">reasoned</a> that since the FISA Act&nbsp;specifically waved state immunity for 3 sections, lawmakers&nbsp;intended all other sections to have&nbsp;state immunity as well. Further, the court decided that the law&nbsp;intends injunctive&nbsp;or declaratory relief, outside of those three sections, to be barred.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is that the laws seem to support the government's activities. It is the legislation itself that has created loopholes for the government that threaten constitutional rights.</strong></p>

<p>In 2013, the EFF was<a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/national-security-letters-are-unconstitutional-federal-judge-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="EFF won case against National Security Letters"> successful</a> in a case against National Security Letters, the letters the government sent to companies demanding cooperation along with a gag order. In that case, Judge Susan Illston decided that National Security Letters were unconstitutional. However, she stayed the motion, pending the government's appeal.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;same year, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131125/02335125348/us-govt-appears-to-have-misled-supreme-court-about-how-nsa-spied-americans.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="NSA">found</a> that the NSA was not informing defendants in criminal cases that they were being spied on. He demanded the government correct this, which in turn, finally allowed individuals to challenge the orders.</p>

The EFF and ACLU joined cases involving&nbsp;alleged domestic terrorists to challenge the NSA, because "[e]veryone deserves due process, and to be innocent until proven guilty," Toomey says. The government has returned with a state secrecy defense and other <p><a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_062708.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="evasive defenses">evasive defenses</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Looking to the Supreme Court</strong></h3>

<p>The Supreme Court has refused to look at several cases stemming from the Patriot Act: <em><a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_post-constitutional_era_20140504" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Chris Hedges">Hedges v.

<p>District Judge Richard Leon, in <em>Klaymen v.

<p>However, in <em>Smith v. Obama</em>, a case following Leons' decision, Judge B. Lynn Winmill&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/03/another-federal-judge-rules-on-legality-of-nsa-surveillance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="dismissed on 4th amendment grounds">dismissed</a>&nbsp;plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim, although she referenced Leons decision, saying it <em>“should serve as a template for a Supreme Court opinion.

<p>The EFF and ACLU have filed hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests for FISC decisions on the legality of section 215 of the Patriot Act, the FISA Amendment Act, and executive orders allowing surveillance outside of FISA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3361/summary" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Freedom Act">The Freedom Act</a>, which passed the House, but failed to pass the Senate in December 2014, addressed many concerns about mass surveillance.

<p>The ACLU has over 500,000 members and a budget of over $100 million. The EFF has about 26,000 members and reported almost $10 million in funds in 2013. The voices of civil liberties groups and similarly concerned citizens seem to be having an effect on legislation.</p>

<p>Andrew Crocker, of the EFF, says citizens have the ability to pressure representatives for legislation that protects their rights. He believes we need stronger legislation, even stronger than the Freedom Act.</p>
