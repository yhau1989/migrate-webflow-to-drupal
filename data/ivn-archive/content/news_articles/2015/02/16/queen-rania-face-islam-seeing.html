[advertisement title="" type="outset"]A few weeks ago, the media buzzed with pictures of Queen Rania of Jordan consoling the wife of the<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/556522/Jordan-Queen-Rania-Fighter-Pilot-Widow-Premonition-Death-Islamic-State-Video" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jordanian pilot </a>who had been executed&nbsp;by the Islamic State.</p>

<p>Jordan tried to negotiate for the release of the pilot, but&nbsp;recent reports have led the Jordanians to believe that the pilot was executed a month earlier than the Islamic State&nbsp;reported&nbsp;-- by being gruesomely burned alive while onlookers video taped the execution.</p>

<p>Since then, the Jordanian government's response has been quite clear, taking the lead in bombing Islamic State&nbsp;targets in a spectacular display of air power. In a show of grief and solidarity, the family of the pilot and the royal family waited to welcome home the first sorties of aircraft bombing Islamic State&nbsp;targets in Syria.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/jordan-goes-all-against-isis-how-long-306093" rel="noopener noreferrer">one source questioned</a> whether Jordan could keep up this total war in the air for long due to budgetary and supply constraints. But over the weekend, numerous Pentagon and State Department officials were <a href="http://rt.com/news/232343-jordan-us-weapons-supply/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted&nbsp;</a>on condition of anonymity that America would not let the Jordanians run out of bombs for as long as they stayed in the fight.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="One look at Queen Rania should be enough to tell us that Jordan is leading the way among Islamic countries in moving toward equality." author="David Yee, IVN contributor"]Jordan has long been an ally and a progressive Islamic nation. But this is the face of Islam we should be seeing -- both the compassion and comforting of Queen Rania and the bombs falling out of the sky in reaction to the brutality of the Islamic State.

<p>This is their fight, too, with their progressive way of life jeopardized by the radical and fundamentalist interpretations of Islam that the Islamic State&nbsp;imposes. One look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueenRania" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen Rania</a> should be enough to tell us that Jordan is leading the way among Islamic countries in moving toward equality.</p>

<p>The Islamic State&nbsp;has made a fundamental error in its&nbsp;strategy, and has incurred the wrath of a very powerful regional government.</p>

<p>The number of Islamic governments against the Islamic State&nbsp;is growing, with both Libya and Egypt entering&nbsp;the fight after 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians were beheaded after being kidnapped in Libya.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Americans see this development for what it is. The moderate Islamic governments are no longer going to tolerate the savagery of the Islamic State&nbsp;in the name of their religion. We can only hope that they stay in the fight for the duration.</p>
