[advertisement title="" type="outset"]While proposed reforms to government surveillance continue to stall, there are bipartisan efforts currently being made in Congress to protect Americans' online privacy.

<p>Authorized in 1986, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) includes&nbsp;a provision that allows the government to access private users' e-mails stored on a third-party server after 180 days. At the time of its passage, when electronic communication was rare, e-mails kept beyond six months were considered "<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/699" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned</a>."</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2015/02/11/256304/government-wonders-whats-in-your.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>McClatchy</em></a>, the government can use the "180 day rule" to seize these emails&nbsp;using "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_subpoena" rel="noopener noreferrer">administrative</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/08/administrative-subpoenas/all/" rel="noopener noreferrer">subpoena</a> power." This&nbsp;authority&nbsp;permits a federal agency to issue a subpoena withour prior judicial oversight.</p>

<p>However, it is not just a matter of users deleting e-mails and other electronic documents. If those <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2015/02/11/256304/government-wonders-whats-in-your.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">documents</a> are held on a third-party server, such as the Cloud, "even deleted files still could be fair game."</p>

<p>To combat such overreach, U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.) introduced the E-mail Privacy Act&nbsp;to compel authorities to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause. It <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/699" rel="noopener noreferrer">also</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Requires a law enforcement agency, within 10 days after receiving the contents of a customer's communication, or a government entity, within 3 days, to provide a customer whose communications were disclosed by the provider a copy of the warrant and a notice that such information was requested by, and supplied to, the government entity."</blockquote>
<p>With 240 <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/699/cosponsors" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosponsors</a>&nbsp;to date, Yoder&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2015/02/11/256304/government-wonders-whats-in-your.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> that their legislation is simply to preserve due process:</p>
<blockquote>"The government is essentially using an arcane loophole to breach the privacy rights of Americans. . . . They couldn't kick down your door and seize the documents on your desk, but they could send a request to Google and ask for the documents that are in your Gmail account."</blockquote>
<p>The effort to restore Americans' digital privacy has also been picked up in the Senate by a bipartisan team. U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) are teaming up to reform the ECPA as well.</p>

<p>Lee, a Republican with tea party ties, <a href="http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/02/15/sens-leahy-lee-make-bipartisan-push-for-electronic-communications-privacy-act-of-2015/" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke</a> on the need to update the act:</p>
<blockquote>"In the nearly three decades since ECPA became law, technology has advanced rapidly and beyond the imagination of anyone living in 1986. . . . The prevalence of email and the low cost of electronic data storage have made what were once robust protections insufficient to ensure that citizens' Fourth Amendment rights are adequately protected."</blockquote>
<p>Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and the author of the 1986 bill, <a href="http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/02/15/sens-leahy-lee-make-bipartisan-push-for-electronic-communications-privacy-act-of-2015/" rel="noopener noreferrer">argues</a> that their reforms will restore:</p>
<blockquote>"Consumer trust, and it provides law enforcement agencies with the proper tools they need to ensure public safety. This is a bipartisan issue, and now is the time to act swiftly to bring Americans' privacy rights and protections into the digital age."</blockquote>
<p>Common sense may dictate the need to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. At ComputerWorld.com, Grant Gross <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2884018/lawmakers-introduce-two-bills-to-protect-email-privacy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a> that for supporters of ECPA reform, "it doesn't make sense for data stored past six months to have fewer legal protections than other personal data."</p>

<p>In 2013, Yoder introduced a version of the E-mail Privacy Act. Despite gaining the 218 cosponsors needed to pass the House, the legislation never reached the floor for a vote.</p>
