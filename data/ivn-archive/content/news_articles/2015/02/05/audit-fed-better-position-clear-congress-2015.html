<p><span>Amidst a nationwide outbreak of measles, Kentucky U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R) made <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231501-rand-paul-the-state-doesnt-own-your-children" rel="noopener noreferrer">headlines</a>&nbsp;this week for his controversial defense of a parent's right to choose whether or not&nbsp;to vaccinate their child.</span></p>
<p><span>What’s gone relatively unnoticed by the mainstream media, however, is his most recent effort to audit the Federal Reserve. Introduced last week, the <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/files/documents/GRA15012.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015</a>&nbsp;would allow the Government Accountability Office to audit&nbsp;the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Reserve banks.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><span>“</span>A complete and thorough audit of the Fed will finally allow the American people to know exactly how their money is being spent by Washington. The Fed's currently operates under a cloak of secrecy and it has gone on for too long. The American people have a right to know what the Federal Reserve is doing with our nation's money supply. The time to act is now,"<span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential 2016 presidential candidate said in a statement. - U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.)</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, it would allow for the review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy discussions that have been legally exempt from a GAO audit since 1978.</p>
<p><span>[advertisement title="" type="outset"]If passed, this bill will come as welcoming news to Americans, who <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/november_2013/74_want_to_audit_the_federal_reserve" rel="noopener noreferrer">overwhelmingly favor</a> auditing the Fed and making the results available to the public.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/231027-rand-paul-reignites-audit-the-fed-effort" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by The Hill, the bill already has 29 co-sponsors, including two other potential presidential contenders, U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii is the lone Democratic supporter. She touted the need for greater transparency in a statement, arguing that it "</span><span>will increase the American public’s confidence in the Fed rather than diminishing it."</span></p>
<p><span>Similar bills previously passed the House but stalled in the Senate. As <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/09/17/harry-reid-one-obstacle-standing-way-audit-fed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>&nbsp;previously on IVN, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was the "</span><span>one and only obstacle preventing an audit the Fed bill from passing Congress.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With the Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate, it looks likely that the audit the Fed movement may make its way to President Obama’s desk in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p>
