[advertisement title="" type="outset"]Over the past month or so, several media outlets have&nbsp;made a big deal about&nbsp;the fact that <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-scott-walker-mulls-white-house-bid-questions-linger-over-college-exit/2015/02/11/8e17ea44-b13e-11e4-886b-c22184f27c35_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="As Scott Walker Mulls White House Bid, Questions Linger Over College Exit">Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's</a> education does not include a bachelor's degree, and have speculated on how this could affect a potential 2016 presidential run.</p>

<p>Some have taken to the media <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/15/scott-walker-wisconsin-candidate-president-state-column/23454543/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Scott Walker's National Education Effect: Column"><span>to defend him</span></a>, claiming that "many college degrees don't signify much besides a limited ability to show up on time," or that&nbsp;having a degree does not "necessarily even produce a leg up economically."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/24/8103241/scott-walker-college-degree" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Scott Walker Would Be the First Presidential Nominee Without a College Degree in 50 Years">Vox</a> stated that some of Walker's characteristics, like his academic past, may help him in a presidential campaign because he is seen "as a Midwestern-everyman."</p>

<p>As of <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p20-566.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Educational Attainment in the United States: 2009">2009</a>, almost 28 percent of all Americans 25 and older&nbsp;had a bachelor's degree or higher, while almost 65 percent did not have a formal college degree of any kind. It appears that Walker does typify the average American, something that could be useful if he decides to run in 2016.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;Americans are actually more likely to purse an advanced education today than they were in the past. Fifteen years ago,&nbsp;less than <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">25 percent</a> of people 25 and older had a bachelor's degree or higher. This is not a significantly low number compared to 2009's, but a lower number nonetheless.</p>

<p>The average American that Walker exemplifies may be slowly disappearing.</p>

<p>But there is another potential positive to all of this for Walker. He could return to school to finish out his degree and become <a href="http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-s-lack-of-a-college-degree-could-be/article_db903156-e17b-5062-bf72-c18cbc538408.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Scott Walker's Lack of a College Degree Could Be a Win-Win, Presidentially">an inspirational figure</a> to those who have struggled to obtain theirs. Of course, some might see this as conceding to his <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/02/12/howard_dean_bashes_scott_walker_for_not_having_a_college_degree_calls_him_unknowledgeable.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Howard Dean Bashes Scott Walker For Not Having A College Degree, Calls Him &quot;Unknowledgeable&quot;">critics</a>, putting him in a difficult position.</p>

<p>The point of mentioning all of this is not to say that those without college degrees cannot be successful. Clearly Walker's experience has been the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Rather, this information simply highlights why some Americans might be surprised when they come across his&nbsp;education experience&nbsp;coupled with the success he has obtained.</p>

<p>Education level is usually a significant characteristic of anyone looking to find a job; so even if it may not be a<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/02/24/a-college-degree-wasnt-always-a-must-for-u-s-presidential-candidates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="A College Degree Wasn’t Always a ‘Must’ for U.S. Presidential Candidates"> must-have</a> for the position, it should be expected that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/02/23/what-many-have-in-common-with-scott-walker-college-credits-no-degree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="What Many Have in Common With Scott Walker: College Credits, No Degree">some will pay closer attention</a>&nbsp;to this aspect of a person if he or she&nbsp;is running for the highest political office in the land.</p>

<p>Of course, such concern doesn't appear to be having too&nbsp;much of an effect since Walker is in first place in Iowa, according to a recent<a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2158" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="February 25, 2015 - Walker Has Strong Early Lead In Iowa GOP Caucus, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Conservative Base With Large Dose Of Tea Party"> Republican poll</a>. Even though his education may play a large role in the election, it certainly does not appear to be an&nbsp;overriding factor.</p>
