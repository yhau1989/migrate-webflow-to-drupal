[advertisement title="" type="outset"]A Rasmussen Reports <p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/54_think_democrats_should_run_a_fresh_face_in_2016" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> released Thursday found surprising results concerning&nbsp;how the public views the&nbsp;2016 presidential nominees.</p>

<p>The survey asked likely&nbsp;Democratic voters if the party&nbsp;should "look for a fresh face to run for president in 2016" or if it&nbsp;should "promote a candidate who has already run in the past." Forty-four percent think the Democratic Party should support a candidate who has already run, while 57 percent disagree or aren't sure: 36 percent want to see a “fresh face” run and 21 percent are still undecided.</p>

<p>When the same question was asked to likely U.S. voters, a similar majority prevailed. Fifty-four&nbsp;percent think the Democratic Party should have a “fresh” candidate for 2016, while only 22 percent think they should support an established candidate and 23 percent of voters&nbsp;are not sure.</p>

<p>Opinions of prospective 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were also investigated in the survey. A majority of voters polled expressed support for a “new” candidate over an “old” candidate, which indicates&nbsp;lower support for a well-known politician like Clinton.</p>

<p>Although the survey stated that 84 percent of Democrats report having a favorable opinion of Clinton, 56 percent of unaffiliated voters hold the opposite view, with 34 percent expressing a “Very Unfavorable” view of Clinton. Of all unaffiliated voters surveyed, 58 percent were in favor of the Democratic Party supporting a “fresh face” in 2016.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="56% of unaffiliated voters do not hold a favorable view of Hillary Clinton." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295660307" handle="" hashes=""]Despite Clinton’s popularity as first lady, senator, and secretary of state, the survey indicates her presidential campaign may not be the landslide some pundits have predicted.

<p>Rasmussen Reports attributes the unexpected drop in support for Clinton in part to “national security concerns” about Clinton’s singular use of private e-mail during her time&nbsp;as secretary of state. The report also refers to voter concerns about significant donations to the Clinton Foundation by foreign governments as another possible culprit for the survey results.</p>

<p>From the data reported in the&nbsp;Rasmussen Reports survey, Hillary Clinton appears to be a polarizing figure among Democrats and Republicans. While this isn't altogether surprising, the divided consensus among unaffiliated voters as well as the majority of Democrats who&nbsp;favor a new candidate over an established candidate both muddy the widespread predictions for the 2016 presidential race that place Clinton as a frontrunner.</p>
