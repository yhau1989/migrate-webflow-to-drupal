<p>The AP reported Wednesday that for the second consecutive year the Obama administration more often than ever censored or denied access to government&nbsp;files under the Freedom of Information Act. Not only that, but when the government&nbsp;did follow through with FOIA requests, it took longer to turn over the files.</p>
<blockquote><em>"The government's new figures, published Tuesday, covered all requests to 100 federal agencies during fiscal 2014 under the Freedom of Information law, which is heralded globally as a model for transparent government. They showed that despite disappointments and failed promises by the White House to make meaningful improvements in the way it releases records, the law was more popular than ever. Citizens, journalists, businesses and others made a record 714,231 requests for information. The U.S. spent a record $434 million trying to keep up.</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>The government responded to 647,142 requests, a 4 percent decrease over the previous year. The government more than ever censored materials it turned over or fully denied access to them, in 250,581 cases or 39 percent of all requests. Sometimes, the government censored only a few words or an employee's phone number, but other times it completely marked out nearly every paragraph on pages.</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>On 215,584 other occasions, the government said it couldn't find records, a person refused to pay for copies or the government determined the request to be unreasonable or improper."</em> - AP</blockquote>
