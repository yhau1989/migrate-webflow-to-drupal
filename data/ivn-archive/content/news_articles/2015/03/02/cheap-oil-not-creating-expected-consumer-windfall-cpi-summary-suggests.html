[advertisement title="" type="outset"]The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consumer Price Index Summary</a> (CPI) on Thursday with mixed economic news. As expected, energy prices had spectacularly lower numbers. However, this did not carry over into other industries as many had hoped and predicted.</p>

<p>Energy items had&nbsp;a 12-month average of -19.6 percent, which lowered the average index for all items to a 12-month average of -0.1 percent. This news has slightly increased deflationary fears in world markets, especially among some policymakers in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31646256" rel="noopener noreferrer">eurozone</a>.</p>

<p>While this is technically defined as deflation, other products are not following oil's lead -- many were expecting larger drops in food prices since the price of food is tied to transportation and production costs related to oil.</p>

<p>All items, other than food and energy, have continued a slow, steady upward trend, hovering at 1.6 percent annual inflation.</p>

<p>This is considered good news, as systemic deflation is considered an economic powder-keg. Deflation encourages consumers to hold off on purchases, hoping the value of their money increases, which creates rising inventories, reduced production, layoffs, and can&nbsp;turn into a period of hyper-inflation.</p>

<p>Still,&nbsp;this news goes against what many Americans predicted from cheap oil prices. Not only were Americans supposed to have more disposable income, but&nbsp;products were also supposed to be cheaper because of production costs associated with oil. It was supposed to be the jackpot for consumers.&nbsp;But it's not happening -- at least, not according to these CPI numbers.</p>

[toggles accordion="true"] [toggle title="Why Is Systemic Deflation So Bad?" id="b1"]Since the Carter administration, inflationary fears have been the "Boogeyman" of monetary theory: inflation is the systemic rise in prices in an economy.

<p>Since&nbsp;G. William Miller's catastrophic mishandling of the 1970's crisis, the Federal Reserve has tightly controlled inflation with low interests rates and monetary policy.</p>

<p>Systemic deflation can be defined as the widespread lowering of prices throughout the economy. Intuitively, it's hard to believe that this could be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Historically, systemic deflation&nbsp;usually&nbsp;happens after prolonged recession or depression.</p>

<p>When deflation happens in one or two sectors, it generally&nbsp;benefits consumers, and either encourages consumption or signals the end of production (obsolescence of a product category is generally preceded by lower prices).</p>

<p>Technology-driven consumer products&nbsp;are&nbsp;a category that inherently has deflationary tendencies (a 26" color TV cost upwards of three-months salary at minimum wage in the 1960s, but now can be bought with mere hours at minimum wage). However,&nbsp;this is also offset by a portion of consumers&nbsp;willing to purchase the newest and best at the premium price.</p>

<p>When deflation hits the entire economy, though, the "animal spirits" in the collective consumers' psyche take over.</p>

<p>The inherent thought becomes, "Why buy today when I can buy tomorrow at a cheaper price?"</p>

<p>And then a cycle begins that has no good policy for correction: Inventories build up, firms cut production (layoffs, shutdowns, etc), firms lower prices to encourage consumption, people are enticed by tomorrow's lower prices, and the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>In monetary policy, the correct measure is usually to raise the interest rate. But that also has the psychological effect of lowering consumption on items tied to credit purchases.</p>

<p>Over-reaction by monetary policy and/or industry causes the worst possible scenario.</p>

<p>If production is cut too much (or too many businesses go under), then all of a sudden you have a lot of dollars chasing few products -- the breeding grounds of hyperinflation.</p>

<p>In the 2015 American economy, there is some&nbsp;speculation that systemic deflation is not going to happen, primarily because we are on the "upswing" of the Great Recession.</p>

<p>Probably the single greatest&nbsp;signal against this is the movement of commodities compared to the stock market's performance. Historically, most market analysts have believed&nbsp;in a low correlation (positive or negative) between&nbsp;stock price indexes and commodities.</p>

<p>This is why people generally buttress their portfolios with commodities to protect against slumps in the capital markets -- they typically do this to limit damage, as opposed to having holdings that work against each other.</p>

<p>However, since at least 2008, commodities have had a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102314476#." rel="noopener noreferrer">sharp inverse correlation</a> with stock prices, with commodities in general on a significant downward trend.</p>

<p>This has the potential of creating a market that is "working against itself." An interesting academic paper about this phenomenon can be found <a href="http://www.bis.org/publ/work420.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>All eyes are now on the March 4 release of the Federal Reserve's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beige Book</a>, which will give analysts greater insight into consumer spending habits.</p>

<p>In particular, this Beige Book will tell analysts what consumers are doing with the surplus disposable income created by lower energy prices.</p>

<p>Are consumers spending, saving, or paying down debt? Each has different economic consequences in this mixed market.</p>

<p>Worldwide oil inventories are <a href="http://ycharts.com/indicators/us_change_in_crude_oil_inventories" rel="noopener noreferrer">extraordinarily high</a> for winter months, signaling a prolonged suppression of worldwide oil prices. This, in turn, could continue to cause significant damage to the domestic oil industry, which is already facing massive layoffs.</p>

<p>In the short-term, we have good news. But what this will mean for the U.S. economy in the long-term is anyone's guess, as dozens of competing theories on the effects of the worldwide oil glut predict everything from economic prosperity to economic disaster.</p>
