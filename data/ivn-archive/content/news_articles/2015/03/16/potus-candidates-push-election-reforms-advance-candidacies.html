[advertisement title="" type="outset"]The Washington Post reported Monday that the way voters participate in presidential primary elections, who will be allowed to participate, and when may change in a handful of states based on how particular systems will help an individual candidate.

<p><em>"Earlier this month, Kentucky Republicans took the first step toward abandoning a presidential primary in favor of a caucus, at the behest of Sen. <strong>Rand Paul</strong>. Elsewhere, supporters of more centrist candidates such as New Jersey Gov. <strong>Chris Christie</strong>, Republican, and former Florida governor <strong>Jeb Bush</strong>, Republican, are pushing for primaries they believe will attract a more moderate electorate than caucus contests, which typically draw a more vocal conservative crowd." - Reid Wilson, The Washington Post
