<p>The latest report from the California secretary of state shows that another 400,000 voters have registered "No Party Preference," while Republican and Democratic registration has dropped by 300,000 voters. Nonpartisan voters now account for 23 percent of registered voters, just 5 percentage points less than those registered with the Republican Party.</p>
