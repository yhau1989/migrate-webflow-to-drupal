<p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.texastribune.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Tribune</a> reporter Jay Root,&nbsp;U.S. Senator <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a></strong> (R-Texas), now a <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/03/23/ted-cruzs-potus-announcement-controversial/" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 presidential candidate</a>, answered several questions on a vast array of topics, including responding to people who compare him to Barack Obama, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate change</a>, the use of personal email for government business, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">marijuana legalization</a>, and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gay-marriage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">same-sex marriage</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to the latter two subjects, Cruz says he is a strong supporter of states' rights, and will defend a state's right to decide their own policies on these issues even at the expense of his own personal views.</p>
<blockquote><em>'I don’t support drug legalization, but I do support the Constitution,' [Cruz]&nbsp;said. 'I think individual states can choose to adopt it. So if Texas had it on the ballot, I’d vote against it, but I respect the authority of states to follow different policies.'&nbsp;</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Cruz made a similar argument about gay marriage.&nbsp;</em>

&nbsp;

<em>'If you can convince your fellow citizens that it’s good for the families, it's good for the state of&nbsp;Texas to change its marriage laws, then Texas has the constitutional power to do so,' he said on gay marriage legalization. 'But it is not legitimate for an unelected federal judge to impose his or her policy preferences because they disagree with the citizens of the state of Texas.'"</em> - Texas Tribune, March 24, 2015</blockquote>
<p>Media talking heads&nbsp;have spent a considerable amount of time speculating over what impact Cruz's campaign will actually have, but Cruz also made headlines on Tuesday because the presidential candidate said he would&nbsp;sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (colloquially known as <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/obamacare/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obamacare</a>), a law he continues to blast as government overreach and a failure.</p>
<blockquote><em>"In a separate&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN interview</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday, Cruz said he would sign up for health care under the Affordable Health Care Act.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>He said his family will likely sign up for a new insurance policy through the U.S. Senate, which is part of the federal exchange.&nbsp;</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Even so, Cruz had harsh words for the law, and pointed to it as a means for him to engage young voters.&nbsp;</em>

&nbsp;

<em>“It is a massive wealth transfer from young, healthy people to everybody else," Cruz said."</em> - Texas Tribune, March 24, 2015</blockquote>
<p>Cruz advocated a <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/08/current-electoral-system-blame-government-shutdown/" rel="noopener noreferrer">government shutdown</a> in 2013&nbsp;as part of his desire to see the health care reform law repealed.</p>
