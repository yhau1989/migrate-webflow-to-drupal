<p>For four consecutive months, Gallup has reported that Americans&nbsp;continue to mention government as the&nbsp;most important U.S. problem. While 'Government,' 'Economy,' and 'Unemployment' have gone back and forth, claiming and reclaiming the top spot, Government now has a 7-point lead.</p>
<blockquote>"While dissatisfaction with government is by no means a new issue to the American people, it has not in recent months been as clearly the leading problem as it is now, given that fewer Americans mention the economy." - Gallup</blockquote>
