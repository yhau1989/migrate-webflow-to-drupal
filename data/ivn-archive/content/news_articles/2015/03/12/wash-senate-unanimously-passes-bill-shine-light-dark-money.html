<p><strong>OLYMPIA, WASH.</strong> -- The Washington State Senate approved a new campaign finance bill Wednesday that would require nonprofit organizations to disclose contributions to political campaigns. State Sens. Andy Billig, a Democrat, and Joe Fain, a Republican, said they worked together on the bill to increase government transparency at the state level.</p>

<p>AP reports:</p>
<blockquote>"After Wednesday's vote, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=5153&amp;year=2015" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Bill 5153</a> now moves to the House for consideration. If it becomes law, it will require nonprofit organizations that can now donate money to political campaigns invisibly to make a quarterly public filing of their contributions. The donations would be viewable via the state Public Disclosure Commission website."</blockquote>
