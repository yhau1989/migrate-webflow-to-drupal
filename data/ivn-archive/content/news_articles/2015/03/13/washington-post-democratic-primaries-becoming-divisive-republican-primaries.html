[gravityform id="47" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]Republican lawmakers are not the only ones who have to worry about divisive primary elections.

<p>A major reason behind hyper-partisan gridlock in Washington is the concern several congressional Republicans have over facing a more conservative challenger in the next primary election. As a result, no effort is taken to reach across the aisle to get things done. According to The Washington Post, voters are seeing the same thing from Democrats.</p>

<p>Primary elections have historically low voter turnout and generally the voters who participate in these elections are the most partisan within a party's base. However, as previously <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/16/partisan-voters-vote-partisan-candidates-elected/?utm_source=ivn&amp;utm_medium=listing_search&amp;utm_campaign=opt-beta-v-1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on IVN</a>, the party bases are moving further toward their respective ideological extremes, and are even challenging traditional notions of where these extremes fall.</p>

<p>From The Washington Post:</p>
<blockquote>"In municipal and statewide Democratic primaries all across the country, liberal candidates have emerged in strong competition against more moderate opponents at a time when the party base is increasingly longing for populist, outspoken standard-bearers. The result could be something akin to what Republicans have dealt with as tea party candidates have been battling centrist Republicans."</blockquote>
