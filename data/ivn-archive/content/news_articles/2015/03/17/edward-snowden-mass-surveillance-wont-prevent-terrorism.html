[advertisement title="" type="outset"]<p><strong>Edward Snowden</strong> is willing to defend spying as a whole, and has done so on many occasions. However, he continues to criticize governments that conduct mass surveillance on their citizens without a real purpose. He argues that just surveilling everyone and collecting their data will not stop a future terrorist attack "because they're not public safety programs. They're spying programs."</p>

<p>"He referenced both the Sydney siege and Charlie Hedbo attacks, noting that the attackers in both incidents were known to governments already," the New York Post reports.</p>
