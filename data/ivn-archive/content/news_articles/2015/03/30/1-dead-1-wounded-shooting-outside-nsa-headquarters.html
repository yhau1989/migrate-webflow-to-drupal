<p>An anonymous official told the AP Monday that a car with at least two men in it tried to ram a checkpoint gate leading into the Fort Meade Army base outside Washington, D.C. According to the official, a gunfight broke out after the men tried to get to the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), leaving one dead and one severely injured.</p>

<p>"The incident began shortly after 9:00 local time (14:00 GMT) when at least two people attempted to drive the vehicle into the National Security Agency section of the Fort Meade facility, according to a statement released by the Army base's public affairs office," the BBC reports.</p>
<blockquote>""We do not believe it is related to terrorism," FBI Baltimore spokeswoman Amy Thoreson told the BBC. FBI investigators have been dispatched to the scene, where they are interviewing witnesses.

Helicopter footage showed two cars - one a police vehicle and the other a black vehicle with no insignia - in a junction that had been roped off near the security gates leading to the NSA.

&nbsp;

The cars appeared to have collided and debris was strewn across the intersection. A white cloth appeared to cover something beside the black vehicle." - BBC, March 30, 2015</blockquote>
