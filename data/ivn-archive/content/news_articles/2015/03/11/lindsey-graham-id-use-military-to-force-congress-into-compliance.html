<p><strong>CONCORD, N.H.</strong> -- <a href="http://www.benswann.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">BenSwann.com</a> reported Wednesday on a recent speech from U.S. Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong> (R-S.C.), during which he said he would "literally use the military to keep [Congress]" in session to deal with non-compliance on defense spending. Graham was speaking to the Concord City Republican Committee, a stump speech ahead of a potential 2016 presidential run.</p>
<blockquote><em>“…and here is the first thing I would do if I were President of the United States, I wouldn’t let Congress leave town until we fix this. I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to.”</em> - <strong>U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)</strong></blockquote>
<p>The article, written by Ron Noyes, also includes a response from Graham's U.S. Senate primary opponent:</p>

<p>“If Graham is not being serious he should choose his words with more thought. If he is being serious those actions would be a threat to the republic,” Noyes said.</p>
