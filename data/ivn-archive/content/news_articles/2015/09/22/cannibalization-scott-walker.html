<p>There's an old story (probably an urban legend), about a farmer who gets knocked out in the pig pen, and while down and out, the pigs wind up devouring him in a crazed feeding frenzy.</p>

<p>In many ways, Scott Walker's exit on Monday has set off a similar political cannibalization -- he's down and out of the race, but he has plenty of really meaty assets and connections for the other contenders to gobble up.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Walker's bundlers really knew how to raise funds, creating a $20 million super PAC in just the first several months of 2015.</p>

<p>This fundraising know-how and connections could be a godsend to several of the top contenders trying to gain ground on Donald Trump's self-financed campaign.</p>

<p>One of Walker's prize funders was the Ricketts family, who have spent enormous amounts of money on the past two election cycles, often in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/05/17/meet-the-billionaire-ricketts-family-dad-plans-anti-obama-attack-while-gay-daughter-fundraises-for-prez/" rel="noopener noreferrer">very politically diverse ways</a>.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Walker's bundlers really knew how to raise funds, creating a $20 million super PAC in just the first several months of 2015." author="David Yee, IVN Independent Author"]This could mean that even some of the leading outsiders (Fiorina and Carson) could have a shot at cashing in on the Ricketts' open wallet.

<p>While the Koch brothers have largely been quiet this primary season, Walker has long been one of the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/scott-walker-prevails-in-koch-donor-straw-poll-121073" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koch darlings</a>, and the candidate who inherits their doting will walk away with almost unlimited funding potential, if they can make it to the general election.</p>

<p>But it isn't just bundlers and funders up for grabs. Walker's political connections and local networks are an enormous prize.</p>

<p>Within hours, Walker's network in Iowa -- largely seen as his 'do or die' state -- was being carved up between Bush, Rubio, Fiorina, and Cruz.</p>

<p>Each of these candidates rushed in to gather up county chairs, state endorsements, and scheduled campaign stops from the Walker campaign.</p>

<p>It seems that Walker's campaign is only looking for one thing in return for this feeding frenzy: figure out how to derail the Trump candidacy.</p>

<p>Walker has <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/250761-walker-trump-campaign-like-watching-a-car-accident" rel="noopener noreferrer">long characterized</a> the Trump campaign as a "side-show" and "watching a car accident." More importantly, Walker is probably correct on the only strategy to derail Trump's campaign.</p>

<p>As long as a large pool of candidates stay in the field, the front-runners will have a hard time&nbsp;landing significant attacks on Trump's lack of substance -- the side-show will continue and Trump's ratings will remain high.</p>

<p>In a 3 or 4-person debate, Trump probably couldn't withstand the attacks on the fact that he has little true policy, and the promise of "great people doing great things" will eventually wear thin.</p>

<p>With Walker's exit, it's now anyone's guess as to who will be next. There seems to be no shortage of candidates polling under 2 percent, both with or without deep pockets to maintain their seemingly hopeless candidacies.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain, it's beginning to look like the Republican primary is going to mirror the 2015 baseball playoffs, with the field being narrowed down to only a couple over the next four weeks.</p>
