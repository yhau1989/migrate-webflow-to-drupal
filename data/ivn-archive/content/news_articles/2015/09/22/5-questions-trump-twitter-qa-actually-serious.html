<p>Republican candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> announced he would hold a live Q&amp;A session from the Twitter headquarters, inviting his millions of followers to take part using #AskTrump while he answered questions on video. The standard domestic and foreign policy questions came as expected, but even questions about football made the cut.</p>

<p>Here's the rundown:</p>
<h3><strong>Q: How will you fix the student debt crisis?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"Student debt is a tremendous problem in the United States. We're going to restructure, we're going to make it possible for people to borrow money, go through college, get through it. We're gonna make it so it's very affordable. Right now, it's not fair. It's one of the only places, frankly, where our country actually makes money, and they make a lot of money, and that should not take place. We're going to make it really good for the student."</em></p>
<h3><strong>Q: What is your political stance on gun control?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"As far as gun control is concerned, I am very pro-Second Amendment. So important, and I believe in it 100 percent. I just released my papers on it, <a href="http://www.DonaldJTrump.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">DonaldJTrump.com</a>. Go to it, check it out, you'll see. Very pro-Second Amendment."</em></p>
<h3><strong>Q: Will you forgo the presidential salary if elected?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"I'm totally self-funding my campaign. I won't take money other than the small stuff because people are invested, and I like that when they invest in the campaign, but I don't take the big dollars. As far as salary is concerned, I won't take even one dollar. I am totally giving up my salary if I become president."</em></p>
<h3><strong>Q:&nbsp;What will you do on your first day as president?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"First thing I'd do on my first day as president is close up our borders so that illegal immigrants cannot come into our country. We have tremendous problems. We owe $19 trillion. We don't know what we're doing. Everything's falling apart. People can come into our country, but only legally. I will close up those borders."</em></p>
<h3><strong>Q: How will you help the homeless?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"Homelessness in our country is a big problem. We're going to take care of it. Now, we have medical issues and we have other issues. But one of the big things is jobs. So many jobs are being taken from our country that people just give up, and ultimately, they have no money, they become homeless. We're going to solve that. We're taking our jobs back."</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twitter can lead to touchy situations for a politician, and in this instance, Trump couldn't escape criticism. For the most part, the Twitter Q&amp;A backfired on him, much like these types of social media chats have always backfired on high-profile candidates who make headlines for controversial remarks or actions.</p>
