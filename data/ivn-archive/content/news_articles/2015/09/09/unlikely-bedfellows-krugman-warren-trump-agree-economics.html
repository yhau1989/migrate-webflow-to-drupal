<p>In an opinion piece for the New York Times, <strong>Paul Krugman</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/paul-krugman-trump-is-right-on-economics.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">argues</a> <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> is right on economics. This defense of Trump comes after <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong> began <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/01/jeb-bush-is-unloading-on-donald-trump-good-luck-with-that/" rel="noopener noreferrer">attacking</a> Trump as a false conservative for previously supporting a single-payer health care system, raising taxes on the wealthy, and having a relatively pro-choice stance on abortion.</p>

<p>Trump's candidacy continues to turn the political world on its head. Even Massachusetts Democrat, <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, briefly <a href="http://www.wcvb.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-says-she-agrees-with-donald-trump-on-some-things/35156908" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentioned</a>&nbsp;she agrees with Donald Trump on certain issues, one being an increased tax on billionaires.</p>

<p>Granted, Warren supporting taxes on billionaires should not come as a surprise. Although, what is intriguing is that the&nbsp;Republican front-runner continues to lead in the polls after being criticized for false conservatism. An indictment like this in previous Republican primaries would sink a candidate's campaign.</p>

<p>The ability of Trump to remain high in Republican primary polls proves voter sentiments are changing and their representatives aren't changing with it.</p>

<p><span>Krugman's article criticizes the state of GOP politics through Bush’s strategy to attack Trump on everything but his implicit racism. As the once-favored Republican front-runner, Bush is using the same conservative talking points that Mitt Romney used against Obama in 2012, and they didn’t work.</span></p>

<p><span>Romney <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-obama-believes-in-redistribution/" rel="noopener noreferrer">denounced</a> Obama’s stance to raise taxes on the wealthy, arguing Obama favored a redistribution of income even though <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/08/sdt-rich-poor-082712.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">58 percent</a> of Americans agree the wealthy pay too little in taxes. </span></p>

<p><span>Krugman’s central point is that supply-side economics has proven to be an inaccurate portrayal of how the economy produces jobs and laments that every GOP candidate besides Donald Trump must support the supply-side doctrine in order to get donors. It is a critique of campaign finance and conservative economics, something that Donald Trump seems to be defying.</span></p>

<p><span>While Krugman doesn't actually make the case for Trump,&nbsp;there is something in Trump's campaign that defies partisan politics-as-usual. For a Republican front-runner to remain at the top of polls after being accused of supporting taxes on the wealthy and a singly-payer health care system might just mean that political parties, as they have been conducting business, need to alter their playbook in favor of voters.&nbsp;</span></p>
