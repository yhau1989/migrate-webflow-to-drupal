<p>Over the weekend, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman <strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz</strong> <a href="https://www.democrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-responds-to-marco-rubios-yom-kippur-fundraiser" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused</a>&nbsp;U.S. Sen. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/marco-rubio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco Rubio</a></strong> of holding a fundraiser in a home with Nazi paraphernalia. While such items are in the home of real estate developer <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/columnists/mariana-greene/20140321-harlan-crows-rare-papers-and-statues-are-powerful-on-their-own.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harlan Crow</a>, so are historical documents connected to Winston Churchill, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. However, the reference to Rubio and Nazis is actually part of a troubling, but little reported foreign policy position for the Republican senator and several other presidential candidates.</p>

<p>Ever since the protests in Ukraine toppled president Viktor Yanukovych in early 2014, there have been suggestions that neo-Nazi elements have been key in the triumph of the protesters. While Russia has <a href="https://www.rt.com/politics/252317-ukraine-nazi-dolgov-russia/" rel="noopener noreferrer">frequently</a> <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/05/14/putin-ties-ukraines-government-to-neo-nazis-a-new-law-seems-to-back-him-up/" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> Ukraine has a coup government run by neo-Nazis and anti-Semites, Kiev has insisted&nbsp;that there are no far-right participants.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The reference to Rubio and Nazis is actually part of a troubling, but little reported foreign policy position for the Republican senator." author="Carl Wicklander, IVN Independent Author"]In parliamentary elections, far-right parties <p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30414955" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed</a> to win any representation. However, a lack of electoral success does not preclude the possibility of a far-right or neo-Nazi presence in the Ukrainian government's battles with Russia.</p>

<p>Last year, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30414955" rel="noopener noreferrer">presented</a> a medal to Belarussian nationalist Serhiy Korotkykh for his service fighting in Donetsk. Korotkykh was a founder of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society, located in Russia.</p>

<p>The U.K. <em>Telegraph</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11025137/Ukraine-crisis-the-neo-Nazi-brigade-fighting-pro-Russian-separatists.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that one of the toughest forces fighting for the government against separatists in eastern Ukraine is the Azov battalion, a group whose founder said their mission was&nbsp;to "lead the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival." The <em>Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/azov-far-right-fighters-ukraine-neo-nazis" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that at least some fighters in the battalion want to fight the Kiev government after the war in the east ends.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Rubio <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/my-vision-for-europe/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a>&nbsp;NATO expansion to counter Russian aspirations. He said this enlargement could include "Ukraine if it so chooses." On his campaign website, Rubio <a href="https://marcorubio.com/press-release/how-marco-would-roll-back-russias-aggression/" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a>&nbsp;his plan to defend Ukraine includes "lethal military assistance, training, and increased intelligence sharing."</p>

<p>Although often touted for his foreign policy acumen, Rubio has demonstrated flawed judgment in whom he wants to support in foreign conflicts. Before he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/09/05/marco-rubio-the-most-interesting-no-vote-on-syria/" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned</a> against intervention in Syria, Rubio was one of the vocal backers of American involvement in that country's civil war. He <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/02/23/us-senator-marco-rubio-wraps-up-trip-to-israel/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;in early 2013:</p>
<blockquote>"I think one of the things we begin to explore is providing ammunition to rebels. . . . I do think that over the last few months a more responsible group of actors have emerged in contrast to some of the more radical elements that are on the ground in Syria."</blockquote>
<p>Nearly from the beginning of the Syrian civil war, radical and terroristic elements have been <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/15/pentagon-announces-us-troops-and-missiles-to-turkey-syria-border/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fighting</a> within the officially recognized opposition to the Assad regime. Over the weekend, the Pentagon <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/25/pentagon-admits-u-s-gear-in-qaeda-s-hands.html?via=twitter_page" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> that U.S.-trained troops in Syria handed over equipment and gear to al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence that Marco Rubio and his colleagues wish to arm the Ukrainian military with the purpose of seeing neo-Nazis prevail. However, the DNC chairwoman's accusation indirectly brought up how -- regardless of the precise role such actors play in Ukraine -- they are likely to be elevated by such a policy. It would also mark at least the second time Rubio, who is running at around 10% in presidential <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a>, wanted to arbitrate another country's civil war that ended up empowering odious characters.</p>
