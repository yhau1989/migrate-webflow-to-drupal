<p>According to the most recent data, <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/07/06/poll-independents-will-soon-outnumber-republicans-democrats-combined/" rel="noopener noreferrer">45 percent of American voters</a> self-identify as independent of either the Republican or Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Yet, presidential polls focus almost exclusively on “high propensity” primary voters who tend to be heavily partisan. As a result, there is little information related to the sentiments of nonpartisan voters, even those who are registered or ‘lean’ toward a particular political party.</p>

<p>To better gauge where the broader electorate stands, IVN is conducting -- to the best of its knowledge -- the only presidential poll specifically for nonpartisan and independent-minded voters that incorporates <a href="http://ivn.us/2013/10/18/approval-voting-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval voting</a>, which allows participants to select as many candidates as they want.</p>

<p>Are you an independent-minded voter? If so, let us know whom you support:</p>
