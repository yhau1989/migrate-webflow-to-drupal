<p>According to the event's website, Politicon has 12 rooms reserved at the convention center for debates, panels, live entertainment, interviews, meet and greets, and a host of other activities that will take place simultaneously on Friday, October 9, and Saturday, October 10. It is up to attendees to choose which events they want to attend.</p>

<p>The high-profile guest lineup includes <strong>James Carville</strong>, <strong>Ann Coulter</strong>, <strong>Newt Gingrich</strong>, <strong>David Axelrod</strong>, <strong>Cenk Uygu</strong>r, author <strong>Doris Kearns Goodwin</strong>, <em>Daily Show</em>'s <strong>Jordan Klepper</strong>, <strong>Michele Bachmann</strong>, radio host <strong>Hugh Hewitt</strong>, <em>Veep</em> star <strong>Tony Hale</strong>, and many more big names in U.S. politics and political entertainment.</p>

<p>The Independent Voter Project (IVP), co-publisher of IVN, will host its own panel titled, <em>Outside the Partisan Narrative: From Journalism to Elections</em>. The panel will include independent 2014 U.S. Senate candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/greg-orman" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Greg Orman</strong></a>, Political Director for <a href="https://www.crowdpac.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crowdpac</a> <strong>Elizabeth Jaff</strong>, California Assemblywoman <strong>Lorena Gonzalez</strong>, and IVP attorney <strong>Chad Peace</strong>.</p>

<p>"Itâ€™s no secret that the electorate has become increasingly disillusioned with the political process. Trust in the media and our representatives is at all-time lows. And at the same time, more than 45% of voters now self-identify as independent voters," the panel's description states.</p>

<p>Panelists will discuss institutional changes, including election reform, new opportunities in political media, and candidate engagement platforms that are designed to re-engage voters.</p>
