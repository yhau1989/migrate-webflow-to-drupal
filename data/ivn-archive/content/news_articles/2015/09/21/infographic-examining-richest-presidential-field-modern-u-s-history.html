<p>Money's significance in almost any political system can't be underestimated. Even before the days of the Athenian assembly, the wealthy have exerted significant, if not the most influence in the political process.</p>
<p>With $7 billion spent by campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, the net worth of our current presidential candidates can't be ignored. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>'s net worth soars above all others at $4.1 billion, and Sanders holds a humble $300,000. There is a clear dichotomy between the average American's wealth, and that of the presidential hopefuls.</p>
<p>Some key facts to take away:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The median net worth of a U.S adult citizen is $44,900.</li>
	<li>The median net worth of a member of Congress is $442,000.</li>
	<li>Campaign expenditures for the 2012 presidential election alone totaled $2.6 billion.</li>
	<li>An estimated 129 million voted in 2012, which equates to an average of $54.24 per vote.</li>
</ul>
