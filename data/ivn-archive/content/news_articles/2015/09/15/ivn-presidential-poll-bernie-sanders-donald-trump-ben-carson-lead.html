<p>IVN conducted a survey to determine whom independent-minded voters are supporting among the current presidential candidate field. Respondents were asked two questions: (1) If the presidential election were held today, for whom would you vote? (2) What political party, if any, do you think best represents your views?</p>

<p>The poll was promoted to IVN readers who largely self-identify as independent-minded voters. Notably, 51% of IVN's Facebook readers are over the age of 55.</p>

<p>A total of 5,059 respondents participated in the survey. IVN used an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/cc04" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval voting method</a>, which allows voters to choose as many candidates as they want.</p>

<p>A more in-depth cross-tabulation analysis on these results will be conducted in the coming weeks. Here is the overview of the results:</p>

<p>Interestingly, <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> lead the polls, by a significant percent, despite it being an approval voting process. This means that no votes were "taken away" from any candidate because participants could select as many candidates as they wanted.</p>

<p>Also, Democrat Bernie Sanders topped the polls with five Republican candidates between him and the next Democratic candidate, <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, who garnered just 8.6%. <strong>Jeb Bush</strong>, despite a high-name ID,&nbsp;only received 1.6%, which is far less than even the Green Party candidate,&nbsp;<strong>Jill Stein</strong>. Notably, Jill Stein, as the only declared third party candidate in the poll, received 4.8%.</p>

<p>Most national presidential polls survey only high-propensity Democratic or Republican voters. For example, the most recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/14/National-Politics/Polling/release_409.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post-ABC News National Poll</a>&nbsp;surveyed 1,003 adults and asked only&nbsp;likely Republicans and likely Democrats who they would vote for if the election were&nbsp;held today. The results, for obvious reasons, are much different.</p>

<p>IVN's nonpartisan survey was funded by the <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a> (IVP), a publisher of IVN. IVP believes that all voters should be treated the same in the election process, regardless of party affiliation. IVP is most well-known for authoring California's Proposition 14, which established a&nbsp;nonpartisan primary system in that state.</p>

<p>This survey is part of IVP's continued effort to understand voter dissatisfaction with their representation and to find better ways to implement a more representative election system.</p>
