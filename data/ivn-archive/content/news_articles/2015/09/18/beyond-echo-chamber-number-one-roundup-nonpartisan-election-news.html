<h2><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/2015/08/21/lawmakers-election-experts-talk-voting-rights-ca-nonpartisan-primary-summit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawmakers, Election Experts Talk Voting Rights At CA Nonpartisan Primary Summit</a> / <a href="http://www.cafwd.org/reporting/entry/elections-summit-takes-stock-of-californias-nonpartisan-top-two-primary-ref" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elections summit takes stock of California’s nonpartisan, top-two primary reform</a></strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Sources: <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/08/21/lawmakers-election-experts-talk-voting-rights-ca-nonpartisan-primary-summit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVN</a> and <a href="http://www.cafwd.org/reporting/entry/elections-summit-takes-stock-of-californias-nonpartisan-top-two-primary-ref" rel="noopener noreferrer">CA Fwd</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: &nbsp;Straight forward, these two pretty much tell the story of the Summit, held in Sacramento and co-sponsored by the <strong><a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a></strong> and <a href="http://cafwd.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>California Forward</strong></a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Source: John Opdycke, <a href="http://www.openprimaries.org/blog_letter_from_the_president_state_legislators_support_open_nonpartisan_primaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Primaries</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: An interesting piece where great support was shown for the top-two concept from about the last place you’d expect, a national meeting of state legislators--usually the ones, along with the two political parties, most concerned about the hit to the status quo that top-two brings.</p>

<h4><strong>Sources: <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2015-08-25/battle-come.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">News Gazette</a> and <a href="http://www.rebootillinois.com/2015/08/25/editors-picks/mattdietrich/dont-believe-scare-tactics-of-new-group-against-independent-map-amendment/44648/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reboot Illinois</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: Fascinating, must reads. The Independent Map people appear to be the basic, “we need to change this to stop gerrymandering,” while People’s Map has begun an aggressive campaign, including accusing Independent Map of going after gains by minorities relative to voting rights--essentially playing the race card. Looking at past Illinois political battles, this will be prime,</p>

<p>My Take: This piece of legislation, which will be an uphill effort to get passed, is more for the rights of those seeking to get on the ballot. However, there is a good deal here of Pennsylvanians touting California’s top-two and why they believe Pennsylvania should follow suit.</p>

<h4><strong>Source: AJ Higgins, <a href="http://news.mpbn.net/post/maine-green-party-opens-some-primaries-all-independent-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPBN News</a></strong></h4>
<p>My Take: A pretty simple and straightforward announcement declaring they wish to reach out to independent voters and allow them to take part in the Green Party without having to join. It is a decision that will also likely raise the party’s visibility.</p>

John Delaney</a> for the Baltimore Sun</strong></h4>
<p>My Take: Another example of what we see taking place all across the country, looking to give the independent voter a say in their future. &nbsp;Both items discuss the bill by Rep. John Delaney (D-MD) which would call for top two non partisan primaries in all Congressional elections.</p>

<p>My Take: This is a must watch. &nbsp;If I had a magic wand and wanted to explain how it all works and the results experienced so far, this would be it.</p>
