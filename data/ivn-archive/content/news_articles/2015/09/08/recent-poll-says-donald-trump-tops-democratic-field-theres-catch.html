<p>A <a href="http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d950cadf-05ce-4148-a125-35c0cdab26c6" rel="noopener noreferrer">SurveyUSA</a> poll this weekend has captured huge headlines: Republican <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> now tops every Democratic contender.</p>

<p>While this makes for great headlines, looking at the actual study data and methodology tells a slightly different story, one that looks at&nbsp;two different sides of the equation.</p>

<p>SurveyUSA uses robopolling, a method that has become almost synonymous with<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/robopolls-significantly-more-favorable-to-republicans-than-traditional-surveys/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Republican-leaning</a> in the past several elections. In the 2012 election, SurveyUSA conducted 17 polls in the last 21 days of the campaign, with a 2.2 percent average error that skewed Republican. In fact, robopolling in general tended to have about a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/which-polls-fared-best-and-worst-in-the-2012-presidential-race/?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 percent skew</a> toward Republicans in 2012.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, this poll is probably within its own margin of error, making any conclusions drawn from it worthless.</p>

<p>Demographically, the over-50 voters overwhelmingly supported Trump, while the under-50 voters moderately supported the Democratic candidates. And while the under-50 group was bigger, the biggest difference was that the under-50 demographic had a far larger share of undecided voters than the over-50 demographic.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Just the difference in delivery alone can skew the results, but in the end, two different tales were told." author="David Yee, IVN Independent Author"]But there was a more significant problem in the poll, one of methodology that was a structural flaw in the study's design.

<p>There has long been the debate of what happens when cell phones are/aren't included in national polling. At this point, almost all polling companies have had to accept a reality: the cell phone is most people's sole means of communication.</p>

<p>In polling, the Devil is always in the details, and the percentages can be skewed by any number of design tweaks that can significantly change the outcome of the entire poll.</p>

<p>In this poll, 62 percent of respondents were on landlines with voice questioning, while&nbsp;38 percent were on&nbsp;electronic devices (mobile devices) with&nbsp;written questions.</p>

<p>Just the difference in delivery alone can skew the results, but in the end, two different tales were told.</p>

<p>In the "cellphone universe," as the pollsters put it, Clinton defeated Trump by 16 points, Sanders by 12 points, Biden by 17 points, and Gore by 17 points.</p>

<p>Of course the poll included the small caveat, "The more cell-phone respondents a pollster includes in its "mix" of voters, the more Democratic the poll results will be."</p>

<p>It seems as though this poll was purely constructed to achieve a specific outcome by manipulating the numbers of landlines/cellphones, even when there is pretty good demographic data on the percentages of cell phone users available (and it's way higher than 38 percent).</p>

<p>So while Donald Trump can bask in the few days of glory of being on top, reality will eventually sink in and&nbsp;he better hope that cellphone users don't vote in 2016.</p>
