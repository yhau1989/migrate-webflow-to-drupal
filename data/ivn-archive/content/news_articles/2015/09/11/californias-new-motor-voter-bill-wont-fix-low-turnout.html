<p>The California state Senate on Thursday approved a bill that would automatically register to vote any eligible Californian who receives a driverâ€™s license unless they opt out.</p>

<p>The measure was prompted by the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/news-releases-and-advisories/2014-news-releases-and-advisories/db14-094" rel="noopener noreferrer">42%</a> turnout in the November 2014 election, as well as the turnout for the March 2014 election in Los Angeles, in which only about 10% of eligible voters went to the polls.</p>

<p>Nearly 7 million Californians, mostly young people, are eligible but not registered to vote. In an effort to boost the number, Assemblywoman <strong>Lorena Gonzalez</strong> (D-San Diego) introduced a bill modeled on a new law in Oregon to get more people to the polls.</p>

<p>The measure (<a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/605901" rel="noopener noreferrer">AB 1461</a>) was previously approved by the Assembly but returns there for approval of minor amendments and will almost certainly be signed into law by Governor <strong>Jerry Brown</strong>.</p>

<p>But the question remains as to the bill's efficacy: it will certainly accomplish its goal of increasing registration, but the bill only scratches the surface of the causes of diminished voter turnout.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/davenport-institute/content/reports/civichealth_infographic14.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>&nbsp;by the Davenport Institute at Pepperdine University in conjunction with the National Conference on Citizenship on voting tendencies during the 2012 general election, lack of registration only accounts for a fraction of voter non-participation. The report produced the following results as to why citizens don't vote:</p>
<ul>
	<li>20 percent of Californians cited "Too busy, conflicting work or school schedules"</li>
	<li>12 percent said that they were "Not interested, felt like my vote wouldn't make a difference"</li>
	<li>12 percent cited an "Illness or disability"</li>
	<li>10 percent said they experienced "Registration problems"</li>
	<li>10 percent "Didn't like candidates or campaign issues"</li>
	<li>9 percent were "Out of town or away from home"</li>
	<li>6 percent "Forgot to vote or send in absentee ballot"</li>
	<li>3 percent cited "Transportation problems"</li>
	<li>2 percent said that "Polling lines [were] too long"</li>
</ul>
<p>California has certainly addressed a wide variety of structural barriers to voting, including&nbsp;early voting, vote-by-mail, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Voting-rights-intact-for-lower-level-California-6424497.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent restoration of voting rights</a> to tens of thousands of low-level felons, and now, the new automatic registration bill.</p>

<p>However, as a Californian, I find it troubling that 34% of those surveyed cited issues that have been easily avoidable for quite some time. I also find it troubling that it is clearly not the structural barriers, but the attitudinal ones, that are making the largest impact on voter turnout.</p>

<p>Civic engagement and participation in our core governing process, it seems, is at a premium these days. While attitudinal barriers are much more difficult to break through -- and will require leadership from inside and outside the state government -- they are a requisite for adequate representation in California's present and future. And they should be addressed sooner rather than later.</p>
