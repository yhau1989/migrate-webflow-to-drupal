<p>Tennessee State Representative Jeremy Faison (R-Cosby) said last week that he is drafting a bill that would decriminalize marijuana possession by military veterans in the state who have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<p>Rep. Faison <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/faison-to-push-for-medical-marijuana-for-veterans-275a5dc9-bae0-3a5d-e053-0100007ffa4a-363080761.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the Knoxville News-Sentinel, “<em>Pills have side effects. … The No. 1 side effect is suicide.&nbsp;Twenty-eight veterans a day in America are committing suicide.</em>”</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Pills have side effects. … The No. 1 side effect is suicide. Twenty-eight veterans a day in America are committing suicide." author=""]Aside from a bill legalizing low-THC cannabis oil that Gov. Haslam signed in May of this year, marijuana legalization and decriminalization advocates in the state have struggled to gain support for their initiatives.

<p>Faison, who claims to have never tried an intoxicant&nbsp;and whose sister was killed by an inebriated driver, says it takes “<em>a special kind of stupid</em>” to fail to recognize the medical benefits of marijuana in the case of war&nbsp;veterans who&nbsp;suffer from PTSD.</p>

<p>He said that his wife, who holds&nbsp;a master’s degree in nutrition, often says, “<em>For most ailments man has, God has a remedy</em>,” and added that he believes that marijuana can sometimes be used as a natural alternative to&nbsp;pharmaceutical drugs for certain ailments.</p>

<p>Faison’s bill will&nbsp;only decriminalize pot possession by veterans dealing with PTSD. Critics, such as&nbsp;Rep. Sherry Jones (D-Nashville), who relayed an anecdote about a police officer who is wheelchair-bound by seizures, say that the effort is unfair because it does not allow non-veterans with PTSD and other ailments to seek treatment. However, Rep. Jones said that she would be willing to support Faison’s bill as an incremental step to allow a “<em>little piece of the population</em>” to obtain medical marijuana.</p>

<p>In September of last year, Ben Swann released a Truth in Media <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/truth-in-media-feds-says-cannabis-is-not-medicine-while-holding-the-patent-on-cannabis-as-medicine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode</a> exposing the federal government’s mixed messages on medical marijuana.
