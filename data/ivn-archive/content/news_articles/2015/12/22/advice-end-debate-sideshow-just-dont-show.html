<p>There is no doubt that the networks have had a heyday turning the 2016 presidential primary debates into a sideshow, with at times all of the major contenders playing the role of the chief clown.</p>

<p>So great the sideshow that even <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/11/03/president_obama_mercilessly_mocks_gops_debate_demands_how_can_they_handle_putin_if_they_cant_handle_cnbc_moderators/" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> has joined in mocking the utter ridiculousness of the candidates' demands -- he has nothing to lose, why not?</p>

<p>And while Americans have been more captivated by this for its <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/12/14/debates-help-fuel-strong-interest-in-2016-campaign/" rel="noopener noreferrer">entertainment value</a>, the issues are still not being debated or discussed.</p>

<p>Who cares how much <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> reads his Bible, how much tequila <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a></strong> drinks, or how well <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong> is doing on his fantasy football league (all coming from the third Republican debate)?</p>

<p>Even worse, how can a candidate presume to hold the process hostage by <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/12/01/trump-says-may-boycott-next-debate-cnn-doesnt-give-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanding appearance fees</a>?</p>

<p>Likewise, who really cares how much Wall Street will love the next Democratic president, continued interested in the well-trodden Benghazi debacle, or opinions on Donald Trump's latest antic (all from the latest Democratic debate)?</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the real messages are happening at the campaign rallies--where the candidates have the time to actually present their case to the American people. And it's not like the other candidates don't have the ability to immediately respond--call it almost a non-live, yet still interactive debate.</p>

<p>This current primary sideshow is likely to extend into the general election, while pared down to only two candidates at a time--the media has garnered a taste for the sideshow atmosphere and is sure to deliver.</p>
<h3><strong>So, how about either or both sides just choose not to show up to the debates?</strong></h3>
<p>Problem solved.</p>

<p>They can speak about the issues to their ilk, as well as the essential swing and independent votes, all while sidestepping the landmines, gotcha moments, and idiotic, completely off-topic questions set up by a media wanting nothing less than a circus atmosphere.</p>

<p>This has happened before in modern politics, perhaps it's time again.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="The opinions of the critical swing votes and independents shouldn't be formed by a sideshow." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295673225" handle="yee_ivn" hashes=""]In 1964, the debate between Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" and Barry Goldwater's rejection to the legacy of the New Deal could have been one of the greatest debates in presidential history--but it never happened.

<p>While Goldwater was cremated at the polls (486-52 electoral votes), his message is often credited as the inspiration of the modern conservative movement--fully embraced by Ronald Reagan, who equally stomped his opponent in the electoral college (489-49).</p>

<p>The point is, the message got out--so powerfully that even with Johnson's overwhelming victory, it could not stop a fundamental split in the Democratic Party that gave Richard Nixon an easy route to victory in the Electoral College (301-191-46).</p>

<p>Eventually debates returned to the presidential elections in 1976, but not without consequences. Gerald Ford was never able to recover from a guffaw during the debates about the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844449,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soviet sphere of influence</a>--and it was relentlessly used against him.</p>
<h3><strong>What about Clint Eastwood's 'empty chair?'</strong></h3>
<p>Clint Eastwood's surprising, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoqKdWY692k" rel="noopener noreferrer">comical routine</a> at the 2012 Republican National Convention has definitely set a precedent of it being a cowardly act&nbsp;to refuse to engage or leave an 'empty chair.'</p>

<p>But his own speech pointed out the absolute ridiculousness of what is happening in the modern debates--talking heads that aren't actually listening, engaging, or debating each other.</p>

<p>Americans should be voting on their favorite candidate's background, experience, and capabilities--not on whether or not they can be victimized by two hours worth of pre-planned pitfalls and guffaws.</p>

<p>Americans should be interested enough in the process to actually follow the campaigns--of both parties. Because they should see how the evolution takes place each election cycle of pandering to the base, then trying to reach out to the middle.</p>

<p>The opinions of the critical&nbsp;swing votes and independents shouldn't be formed by a sideshow. We can only hope that we can have candidates strong enough to want to win on their overall performance.</p>
