<p>If anything can possibly be said about the 2016 presidential race, it's been entertaining from both sides of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>On the left, there's almost a dramatic angst waiting for Hillary's final implosion (consider 2008), while <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a> keeps packing stadiums with supporters interested in his old ideas reaching newly-receptive ears.</p>

<p>On the right, the sheer number of Republican candidates is still making for a carnival side-show atmosphere, complete with the warm-up act from the under-card debates.</p>

<p>And the sponsoring networks have to be loving it, both for ratings and daily media ammunition from the campaign trail.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="With almost 7-in-10 people watching at least some of the debates, this ranks as one of the most engaged races in modern politics." author=""]But the general public seems to be eating up the entertainment as well, with interest in the debates over 25 percent higher than <p><a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/12/14/debates-help-fuel-strong-interest-in-2016-campaign/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2007</a>. With almost 7-in-10 people watching at least some of the debates, this ranks as one of the most engaged races in modern politics.</p>

<p>But there's a twist, and a really sad one.</p>

<p>The same people polled were also keenly aware that the campaigning so far has had more of an entertainment quality than one of actually discussing and debating the political issues.</p>

<p>Could this be the the first modern presidential election won on the merits of entertainment value?</p>

<p>We should hope not, but there's bad news for independents and Democrats if it is -- Republicans are winning the interest battle among their ilk, with more than a three-fold increase over Democrats and independents.</p>

<p>There's little wonder from the independent standpoint. With no viable independent candidates, the 2016 election will likely come down to&nbsp;the lesser of two evils--and the independent-minded just have to patiently wait for the dust to settle to see which two less-than-hopeful candidates make it through the primary season.</p>

<p>The Democrats, on the other hand, will have to find some way to energize the base -- as they historically thrive in higher turnout elections.</p>

<p>But for now, the Republicans get to enjoy some momentum in voter interest going into 2016, something they haven't had in the past two election cycles.</p>

<p>While the GOP party bosses are getting fed up with the <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/4584778161001/gop-insider-candidates-fed-up-with-carson-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaigning antics</a>, they are getting the best kind of media coverage they could possibly hope for -- free public interest.</p>
