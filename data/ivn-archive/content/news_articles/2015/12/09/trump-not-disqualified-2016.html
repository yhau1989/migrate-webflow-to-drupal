<p>On Tuesday, December 8, a widely reported misconception hit the internet. Headlines with variations of “Trump Disqualified for Presidential Run,” claimed that Trump’s recent proposal to temporarily&nbsp;ban Muslims from entering the country officially violated the Constitution and that he would therefore be unable to run for executive office. This is simply untrue, but the confusion is understandable.</p>

<p>“The first thing a president does when he or she takes the oath of office is to swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,” said White House press secretary in a media briefing. “And the fact is, what Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him from serving as president.”</p>
