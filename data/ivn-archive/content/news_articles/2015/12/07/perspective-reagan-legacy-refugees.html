<p>In Ronald Reagan's first year in&nbsp;office (1981), he faced the enormous task of handling two of the greatest refugee crises our government has ever faced.</p>

<p>The 1980 Mariel boatlift brought&nbsp;almost 125,000 Cuban refugees to&nbsp;the United States, while continued pressures of the Indochina refugee crisis were continuing from America's departure from Vietnam and the fall of Saigon in 1975 -- as well as the Khmer Rouge genocides in Cambodia.</p>

<p>Over 3 million Indochina refugees challenged the western world's ability to absorb immigrants--with over 1.2 million eventually arriving in the United States.</p>

<p>In many ways, Reagan was left with the problems of previous administrations and had to come up with feasible solutions to the refugee crises in America.</p>

<p>Instead of rejecting the previous administration's actions, Reagan developed a new strategy that would:</p>
<blockquote><em>"...continue America's tradition as a land that welcomes peoples from other countries. We shall also, with other countries, continue to share in the responsibility of welcoming and resettling those who flee oppression." -</em> Ronald Reagan, <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=44128" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1981</a></blockquote>
<p>Key to his plan was:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensuring that immigrants and refugees were subject to the rule of law;</li>
	<li>Penalizing companies intentionally violating immigration laws;</li>
	<li>Recognizing that immigration, especially from Canada and Mexico, benefits our economy;</li>
	<li>Amnesty for those illegal immigrants who have a proven history of productivity in the workforce;</li>
	<li>Using the federal government's authority to equitably distribute refugees to the various states;</li>
	<li>Improving amalgamation while reducing welfare dependency; and</li>
	<li>Improving foreign policy to lessen the probability&nbsp;of future international crises causing mass refugee influxes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Did it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Not as expected, and with a lot of similarities to today's problems and concerns.</p>

<p>Some state governors were exceedingly vocal about taking the refugees, among them future president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/17/the-forgotten-story-of-how-refugees-almost-ended-bill-clintons-career/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>Crime was seen as an incredible problem with the refugees from Indochina, with the second and third generation&nbsp;still the largest bloc of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=trt1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=crime+laotian+refugees&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=byUYoYkmgR&amp;sig=3D4J6-I9Y2XjZwiZd-piKRH_TDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMnfanmsXJAhWEZCYKHaCsDAkQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=crime%20laotian%20refugees&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">criminal offenders</a> in California.</p>

<p>Welfare is even worse, and still plagues us today, with Cuban refugees still costing the American taxpayer over <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/us-cuba-welfare-benefits/sfl-us-cuba-welfare-benefits-part-1-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">$680 million</a> in welfare benefits. Many of these recipients have never worked since entering.</p>

<p>These two groups of refugees have become the worst offenders when it comes to amalgamation, with second and third generation children often not knowing basic English skills --&nbsp;<a href="http://www.culturalorientation.net/about/history/expanded-history" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESL careers</a>&nbsp;are still&nbsp;booming in teaching English to those from Indochina.</p>

<p>Reagan's program, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, gave amnesty to over <a href="http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1986_immigration_reform_and_control_act.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.7 million undocumented immigrants</a>, causing an explosion in illegal immigration because of mixed signals coming from the federal government.</p>

<p>But the worst aspect is the lack of reasonable changes to the law, with Cuban refugees still eligible under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-editorial-cuba-welfare-abuse-20151023-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">1966 Cuban Adjustment Act</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Lessons for 2015 and Beyond</strong></h2>
<p>Sidestepping the entire issue of terrorism, amalgamation is the main question that needs to be answered when considering new refugees into the United States.</p>

<p>If the European powers have learned anything in the past three decades, it is that Islamic immigrants have been outright resistant to amalgamation, sparking laws such as the French ban on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28106900" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-faced veils in public</a>.</p>

<p>The true legacy left by the Reagan&nbsp;refugee response is that it is almost impossible to 'force' amalgamation on a reluctant group, something we need to be keenly aware of when dealing with groups practicing (on some level or another) Sharia law, female genital mutilation, and/or religious extremist tolerance.</p>

<p>Amalgamation is the only answer to curbing the possibility of bringing extremist views and behavior into the United States.</p>
