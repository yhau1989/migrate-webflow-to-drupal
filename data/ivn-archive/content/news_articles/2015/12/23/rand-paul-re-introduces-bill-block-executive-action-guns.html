<p>GOP presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul re-introduced a bill on Monday that would prevent funding for any executive order from President Obama that would&nbsp;enact gun control measures.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act, which is currently being <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/263932-paul-aims-to-reign-in-obama-on-guns" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast-tracked</a> through the Senate, and could see a vote as early as next month, is an updated version of a bill that was introduced in the 2013-14 session.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HEN15F53%20%20Firearms%20EXOs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">bill</a> states that any “existing or proposed executive action that infringes on the powers and duties of Congress under section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States shall have no force or effect."</p>
<blockquote>"It is the sense of Congress that any executive action issued by the President before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act that infringes on the powers and duties of Congress under section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States or the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or that would require the expenditure of Federal funds not specifically appropriated for the purpose of the executive action, is advisory only and has no force or effect unless enacted as law."</blockquote>
<p><span>The bill would also give Americans the right to launch a civil lawsuit, if they were affected by an executive action on <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tag/gun-control/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>gun control</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span><i>“In the United States, we do not have a king, but we do have a Constitution,”</i> Paul <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/news/press/sen-rand-paul-reintroduces-separation-of-powers-restoration-and-second-amendment-protection-act-" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>said</span></a>&nbsp;in a statement. <i>“We also have the Second Amendment, and I will fight tooth and nail to protect it.”</i></span></p>
<p><span>In October, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-weighs-expanding-background-checks-through-executive-authority/2015/10/08/6bd45e56-6b63-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>reports</span></a> claimed that Obama was considering using an executive order to&nbsp;circumvent Congress, in order to mandate that anyone who sells more than 50 guns a year has to have a federal license, and any potential customers must have federal background checks.</span></p>
