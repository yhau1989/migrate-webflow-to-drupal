<p>Maine could be the next state to approve a nonpartisan voting method that is designed to give voters a greater say in elections. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting (<strong><a href="http://www.rcvmaine.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">RCV Maine</a></strong>) submitted&nbsp;<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/10/19/grassroots-effort-in-maine-garners-over-70k-signatures-for-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 70,000 signatures</a> in October to Maine's secretary of state to qualify RCV for the 2016 ballot.</p>

<p>The initiative was <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/11/23/maine-sec-state-certifies-ranked-choice-voting-2016-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">certified by the secretary of state</a> in November.&nbsp;If passed, all statewide and congressional races will be required to utilize ranked choice voting. Maine would be the first state in the nation to implement RCV for its elections.</p>

<p>But what is ranked choice voting? Often times when election reform experts and commentators talk about RCV, they use a vernacular only understood by fellow reform activists, people who have spent years talking and writing about these issues.</p>

<p>It is a common mistake in the reform community.</p>

<p>RCV Maine, however, has released a new commercial to help state voters better understand exactly what RCV is and how it could&nbsp;empower their vote at the polls. Check it out:</p>
