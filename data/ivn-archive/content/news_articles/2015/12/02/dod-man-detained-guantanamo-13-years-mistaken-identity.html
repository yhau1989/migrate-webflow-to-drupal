<p>Department of Defense officials admitted on Monday that a man who has been held in the United States prison at&nbsp;Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the last 13 years as a suspected al-Qaeda trainer, was held due to a case of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>Mustafa al-Aziz al-Shamiri, 37, has been&nbsp;held as an&nbsp;indefinite detainee at Gitmo since 2002, despite the fact that he was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guantanamo-bay-detainee-case-mistaken-identity-dod-n472616" rel="noopener noreferrer">never charged</a>&nbsp;and prosecutors lacked adequate evidence for a trial.</p>

<p>During a panel meeting on Tuesday to evaluate whether al-Shamiri can be released,&nbsp;officials <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/01/mistaken-identity-guantanamo-bay-mustafa-al-aziz-al-shamiri?CMP=edit_2221" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a>&nbsp;he was&nbsp;actually a low-level Islamist foot soldier from Yemen who was taken into custody because he was confused with someone with a similar name.</p>

<p>In the DoD’s <a href="http://www.prs.mil/ReviewInformation/InitialReview.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">detainee profile</a> on al-Shamiri, referred to as&nbsp;YM-434, it said&nbsp;he <em>“fought in several jihadist theaters and associated with al-Qaida members in Afghanistan,”</em> but also said he did not carry out the terrorist acts that were the basis of his detainment.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.prs.mil/Portals/60/Documents/ISN434/20151201_U_ISN434_OPENING_STATEMENTS_OF_DETAINEES_REPRESENTATIVES_PUBLIC.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> from&nbsp;al-Shamiri’s personal representative, he was described as <em>“cooperative, enthusiastic and supportive,”</em> and his rep noted that he <em>“does have remorse for choosing the wrong path early in life.”</em></p>

<p>The statement also said al-Shamiri <em>“wants to make a life for himself,”</em> and he is <em>“aware that Yemen is not an option, and he is willing to go to any country that will accept him.”</em></p>

<p>President Obama, who has <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/242129-guantanamo-obama-prison-closure/" rel="noopener noreferrer">promised</a> to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay on numerous occasions,&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/guantanamo-bay-obama-rejects-relocation-091016717.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected</a> a plan to relocate the prison to U.S. soil, labeling it as too expensive with a price tag of over $600 million, and sent it back for revision.</p>
