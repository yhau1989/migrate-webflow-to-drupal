<p>The&nbsp;New Jersey Watchdog reports that&nbsp;potential presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/chris-christie" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Christie</a></strong> spent $82,594 at Jets and Giants games during the 2010 and 2011 seasons.</p>

<p>No, this wasn't coming out of his $175,000/year salary -- it was spent as part of his expense advance,&nbsp;“an allowance of funds not otherwise appropriated and used for official receptions on behalf of the state, the operation of an official residence, for other expenses.”</p>

<p>The governor receives a $95,000 per year allowance, paid quarterly by the state (i.e. <strong>taxpayers</strong>).</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://watchdog.org/217942/christie-nj-expense-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>New Jersey’s governor traditionally enjoys free use of luxury boxes for games and other events at the government-owned venue, but food and beverages cost extra.

&nbsp;

On 58 occasions, Christie used a debit card to pay a total of $82,594 to <a href="https://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/MetLife-Stadium-_-NFL-New-York-Giants-_-New-York-Jets-_-Delaware-North.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delaware North Sportservice</a>, which operates the concessions at MetLife. The governor’s office did not provide any receipts, business reasons or names of individuals entertained, but defended the expense.</blockquote>
<p>Assuming he went to every single home game of both the Giants and Jets, that comes out to about&nbsp;$2,581 per game -- on just food and beverages.</p>

<p>While it is important&nbsp;to note that&nbsp;the New Jersey Republican State Committee <a href="https://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/NJ-GOP-refund-to-Treasury.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">reimbursed the Treasury</a> in March 2012 for Christie's MetLife expenses, when’s the last time you spent $2,581 at ONE sports game?</p>
