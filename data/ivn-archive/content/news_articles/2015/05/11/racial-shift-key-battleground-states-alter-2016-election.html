<p>The 2016 election is already in full swing with eight candidates having officially declared their candidacy (two for the Democratic nomination, six for the Republican nomination). <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polling </a>of these candidates among potential constituencies has already begun as well, to wildly different projections. With 18 months still to go, a lot is sure to change.</p>

<p>However, one factor is sure to influence the election, and that is the changing demographics in the American electorate. Much has been made of the Republican Party's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/03/18/reince-priebus-gives-gop-prescription-for-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer">inability </a>to appeal to Latino voters in 2012, which is the most rapidly growing&nbsp;minority group in the United States. A new <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/08/reflecting-a-racial-shift-78-counties-turned-majority-minority-since-2000/" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis </a>by Pew, however, reveals just how much the American voter landscape has changed in the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>In 78 counties across the United States, the&nbsp;white majority/no-white minorities have flipped. Due to growing minority populations, whites are now the minority. These&nbsp;counties are found primarily in states in the southern part of the country, but range from California to Kansas to North Carolina.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="In 78 counties across the U.S., the white majority/no-white minorities have flipped." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295662811" handle="" hashes=""]How this might influence elections is still undetermined. In congressional elections, this shift has the potential to have the greatest impact. However, due to <p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gerrymandering" rel="noopener noreferrer">gerrymandering</a></strong>, which often creates non-competitive, oddly-shaped congressional districts, these counties do not perfectly align with electoral boundaries.</p>

<p>For the presidential election, this could have huge implications in a few states.</p>

<p>First there is in Florida, a state that is always hotly contested. Four counties in Florida have flipped to non-white since 2000, which&nbsp;could help Democrats in their quest for the Sunshine State. However, with two possible candidates on the Republican side coming from Florida -- <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/marco-rubio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco Rubio</a></strong> -- they might have home court advantage in the state with a strong base of support.</p>

<p>Virginia is another important state. With 13 electoral votes up for grabs, the state is certainly purple. Although the state voted for <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a> in both 2008 and 2012, it largely voted for Republicans in prior elections. However, six counties have flipped since 2000, perhaps indicated a more Democratic-leaning state than before.</p>

<p>Lastly, New Jersey also appears on this list. Four counties switched in the Garden State. Although citizens haven't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, they have voted in various Republican governors, including <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/chris-christie" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Christie</a></strong>, who is considering a run himself. New Jersey, therefore, remains in play when considering the demographic shifts, especially as Christie contemplates his own run.</p>

<p>Sixteen additional states saw changes in minority trends in counties within their&nbsp;borders. There is still plenty of uncertainty regarding the 2016 elections, including the effect these changes will have.</p>
