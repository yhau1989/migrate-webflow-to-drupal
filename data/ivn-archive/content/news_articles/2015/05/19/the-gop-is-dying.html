<p>Campaigns are constantly looking at demographics. Gender, race, economics, and geography all play a role in election strategy. But as many GOP hopefuls look toward 2016, they should consider something else: the GOP death rate.</p>

<p>That's right, the Grand Old Party is just that old. A new article in <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/the-gop-is-dying-off-literally-118035.html?hp=t3_r#.VVpyKpNViko" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico Magazine</a> draws attention to a disturbing trend for Republicans looking forward and that is the death rate gap between Republicans and Democrats is significant. Politico estimates the gap&nbsp;between the number of dead Republicans versus dead Democrats since the 2012 election to be 453,000. While this is a very rough estimate, it should sound alarm bells for the rest of the party.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/millennials" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Millennials</strong></a> are becoming more and more of a powerful voting bloc as they age, and according to exit polling, a strong majority -- 65 percent -- favor the Democratic Party. This is not a surprise to a lot of people. However, it is a very good analogy to current conservative politics. The people are not the only thing that are old and dying -- so are their ideas.</p>

<p>Take a look at the massive shift in attitude on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/poll-gay-marriage-support-at-record-high/2015/04/22/f6548332-e92a-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">marriage equality</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalpartnership.org/blog/general/reproductive-rights.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reproductive rights</a>. The trends are clear, yet no major Republican presidential candidate has come out in support of either.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, the GOP is going to have to change their tune if they are serious about being a relevant party in the 21st century.</p>
