<p>Last week, the General Assembly in North Carolina sent a bill (<a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2015/Bills/House/PDF/H405v4.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 405</a>) to the desk of Governor Pat McCrory that is directed at&nbsp;thwarting undercover investigations that&nbsp;expose businesses'&nbsp;wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The bill is the latest episode in a <a href="http://www.mfablog.org/victory-north-carolina-ag-gag-bill-is-dead-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">perennial back-and-forth dispute</a> between the legislature and investigators documenting animal abuse at farms across the state. In recent years, North Carolina&nbsp;has failed several times to pass a bill criminalizing such investigations.</p>

The so-called "Property Protection Act" allows an employer to seek a recovery of damages caused by a person who gains access to the employer's property without a "bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer" and then&nbsp;uses the documents, recordings, or information in a way that "breach[es] the person's duty of loyalty to the employer."

<p>The&nbsp;House approved the bill in a <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/voteHistory/RollCallVoteTranscript.pl?sSession=2015&amp;sChamber=H&amp;RCS=304" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipartisan vote</a>&nbsp;in April. It cleared the Senate&nbsp;with <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/voteHistory/RollCallVoteTranscript.pl?sSession=2015&amp;sChamber=S&amp;RCS=282" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily</a> Republican support.</p>

<p>The bill's passage comes weeks after an undercover investigator for the advocacy group, Compassion Over Killing,&nbsp;<a href="http://abc11.com/news/new-video-claims-to-show-animal-cruelty-at-nc-farm/696221/" rel="noopener noreferrer">released footage</a> of animal abuse at a chicken farm in Robeson County.</p>

<p>While critics refer to the bill as another "ag-gag" law intent on silencing whistle-blowers and protecting the interests of the state's powerful agricultural industry, HB 405 differs in two important ways from past versions of the bill and existing&nbsp;laws from across the country.</p>

<p>First, the bill protects owners&nbsp;of "nonpublic areas," which it defines as any areas that are not intended for access by&nbsp;the general public.&nbsp;The law&nbsp;would apply to undercover investigators who gain access to a variety of workplaces, including nursing homes and day cares –&nbsp;not just farms.</p>

<p>Second, "ag-gag" laws in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/advocacy-center/ag-gag-whistleblower-suppression-legislation/ag-gag-bills-state-level" rel="noopener noreferrer">other states</a>&nbsp;make it a crime to gain access to&nbsp;property under false pretenses and then capture and disseminate visual or audio recordings. North Carolina's bill makes such action&nbsp;a <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/05/north-carolina-takes-a-civil-approach-with-animal-agriculture-bill/#.VWUaUGRViko" rel="noopener noreferrer">civil</a> rather than a criminal&nbsp;offense.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The law would apply to undercover investigators who gain access to a variety of workplaces, including nursing homes and day cares – not just farms." author="Andrew Gripp, IVN Independent Author"]The employer would have a "right to action" <p><a href="http://rt.com/usa/260185-ag-gag-north-carolina/" rel="noopener noreferrer">under the law </a>to sue the trespassing offender for court costs and up to $5,000 in punitive damages for each day the violation continues.</p>

<p>While the bill sits on Governor Pat McCrory's desk, "ag-gag" laws&nbsp;from Idaho and Utah are being <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/06/18/federal-courts-decide-constitutionality-ag-gag-laws/" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenged</a> in federal courts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agweb.com/article/idaho-ag-gag-law-challenged-in-federal-court--NAA-news-wire/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idaho's law</a>, passed in 2014, criminalizes "interference with agricultural production." Offenders can&nbsp;face up to $5,000 in fines and a year in prison.</p>

<p>In these states, defenders of the laws claim they are protecting employers' property rights.&nbsp;A sponsor&nbsp;of Idaho's "ag-gag" law says&nbsp;it&nbsp;protects businesses and families from the "agri-terrorism" of animal welfare groups.</p>

<p>Critics of the laws argue that&nbsp;they&nbsp;violate the First Amendment, as they&nbsp;impose prior restraint on unauthorized recordings. Opponents also claim they&nbsp;have a chilling effect on investigations that expose abuses that might otherwise go unreported.</p>

<p>Some of the approximately 80 videos made over the last decade have <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/ag_gag_laws_idaho_is_criminalizing_muckraking_to_protect_farmers.2.html#" rel="noopener noreferrer">precipitated</a> criminal prosecutions, plant closures, and meat recalls. In 2008, undercover footage of cow abuse from a California slaughterhouse&nbsp;led to the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/02/17/beef.recall/" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest recall in U.S. history</a> over fears of mad cow disease, salmonella, and E. coli outbreaks.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill is expected to hand down her decision on Idaho's law in the coming weeks. The trial proceedings over&nbsp;Utah's law are scheduled&nbsp;to begin in 2016.</p>

<p>Because North Carolina's bill is based on civil rather than criminal law and does not impose prior restraint or demand "mandatory reporting" of documented abuses to authorities within 24 or 48 hours, it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/05/letter-from-the-editor-better-a-civil-action/#.VWUuxmRViko" rel="noopener noreferrer">may be immune&nbsp;</a>to federal rulings invalidating the "ag-gag" laws of Idaho or Utah.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, Governor McCrory has <a href="http://www.publicnewsservice.org/2015-05-26/animal-welfare/north-carolina-ag-gag-bill-could-impact-daycare-nursing-home-investigations/a46377-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">one week</a> left to sign or veto the bill.</p>
