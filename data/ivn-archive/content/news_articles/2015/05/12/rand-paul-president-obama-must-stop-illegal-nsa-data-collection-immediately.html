[gravityform id="29" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]The Washington Post reported Monday that U.S. Sen. <p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rand Paul</strong></a>, who is running for president in 2016,&nbsp;is calling on President <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a> to end the NSA's bulk <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/data-collection" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>data collection</strong></a> of phone records after the Second Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/05/07/historic-ruling-federal-court-slams-nsa-data-collection/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled that the program is&nbsp;illegal</a>. Paul told NH1 and the Post that "the ruling&nbsp;underscores that President Obama can stop the collection at any point."</p>

<p><em>"The Fourth Amendment says your name has to be on the warrant and you can't put something like 'Mr. Verizon' on the warrant and get ... millions and millions of phone records," he said."</em> - The Washington Post, May 11, 2015</p>
