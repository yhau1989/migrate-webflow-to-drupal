<p>Have you ever felt like your opinion doesn’t matter? That your elected official does not represent you or your district? That your ideas have no impact on public policy?</p>

<p>If you're among the bottom 90% of income earners in America, you may be justified in feeling this way, a new study led by Professors Martin Gilens (Princeton University) and Benjamin I. Page (Northwestern University) finds.</p>

<p>The study analyzed over&nbsp;20 years worth of data to answer the following question:&nbsp;Does the government represent the people?</p>

<p>What they found is that the&nbsp;number of American voters for or against any idea has no impact on the likelihood that Congress will make it law.</p>
<blockquote>“<em>The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”</em> - Princeton University Study.</blockquote>
<p>But there’s a twist…this statistic only holds true to the opinion of the bottom 90% of income earners in America. Big spenders, business interests, and lobbyists with a sizable budget can still influence public policy.</p>

<p>In short, money talks:</p>
<blockquote><em>In the last 5 years alone, the 200 most politically active companies in the US spent&nbsp;<strong>$5.8 billion influencing our government&nbsp;with lobbying and campaign contributions.</strong></em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Those&nbsp;same companies got $4.4 trillion in taxpayer support</strong>&nbsp;— earning a return of 750 times their investment.</em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>It’s a vicious cycle of legalized corruption.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>As the cost of winning elections explodes, politicians of both political parties become ever more dependent on the&nbsp;tiny slice of the population who can bankroll their campaigns.</em> - <a href="https://represent.us/action/theproblem-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Represent.Us</a></blockquote>
