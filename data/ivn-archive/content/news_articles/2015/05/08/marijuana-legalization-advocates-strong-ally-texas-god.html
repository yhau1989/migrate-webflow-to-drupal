<p>Earlier this week, a bill that would fully legalize marijuana in Texas surprised many politicos in the state when it cleared&nbsp;the&nbsp;House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee in a 5-2 vote. The author,&nbsp;state Rep. <strong>David Simpson</strong> (R-Longview), a tea party&nbsp;conservative,&nbsp;is pushing the proposal on religious grounds, arguing that marijuana comes from God and therefore should not be banned.</p>
<blockquote>"State law currently makes no exceptions even for medical marijuana, making outright legalization unthinkable.

&nbsp;

Still, advocates hailed the committee vote as "unprecedented progress" for Texas marijuana rights.

&nbsp;

Nearly three out of five Texas voters (58%) support making marijuana legal for adults and regulating it like alcohol, according to a statewide survey conducted by Public Policy Polling in September 2013." - KSAT San Antonio</blockquote>

<p>The bill still faces unlikely odds even now that it is eligible to reach the House floor before June 1 -- the last day of the current session (sine dine). Still, the fact that it made it out of committee after weeks of languishing may have some believing in miracles.</p>
