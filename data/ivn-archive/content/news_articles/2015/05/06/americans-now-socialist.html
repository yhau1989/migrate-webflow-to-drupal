<p>Vox reported recently on a new Gallup poll that says most Americans now prefer to spread wealth throughout our economy by mostly taxing the rich. What's more intriguing is that the change in attitude has increased significantly in the past four or five years. Don't believe me? Look at this graph:</p>

<p>See, told you. The study also found that many younger people favored taxing the rich by a much wider margin than older people. So not only does <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/04/15/80-years-reefer-madness-grandpa-still-hates-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grandpa not like you smoking pot</a>, he also doesn't like that you are a soft-hearted socialist.</p>
<blockquote>Respondents ages 18 to 34 are supportive of redistributive taxation by a 59-38 margin, while those over 55 are much more skeptical â€” 47 percent say tax the rich, and 50 percent disagree. - Vox</blockquote>
<p>The shift in attitude comes at a time when wealth and income inequality are central themes for both Republican and Democratic candidates. As many pundits dismiss <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong>&nbsp;as being too "radical" or "fringe" to win the nomination, much less the White House, this study suggests that Sen. Sanders is in fact on par with a majority of citizens when it comes to wealth distribution.</p>
