<p><strong>INDIANA</strong> -- Indiana U.S. Representative&nbsp;<strong>Marlin Stutzman</strong> (R-Howe) is expected to make a 'major announcement' on&nbsp;Saturday. Current speculation suggests that he will announce his intentions to run&nbsp;for U.S.&nbsp;Senator <strong>Dan Coats</strong>' (R) soon-to-be-vacated seat. Coats&nbsp;previously indicated that he will not seek re-election in 2016.</p>

<p>From Marlin Stutzman's campaign Facebook page:</p>
<blockquote><em>"If you believe that we need bold, decisive leadership, committed to securing our future and ensuring a strong America, then... Join us next Saturday, May 9 on Main Street in Roanoke!"</em></blockquote>
<p>Stutzman indicated his interest in running for Senate shortly after Sen. Coats announced he wasn't seeking re-election. Stutzman is a staunch advocate for repealing Obamacare and has critiqued the Obama administration throughout his tenure in the U.S. House.</p>

<p>Stutzman was one of a handful of Republicans to <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2015/01/06/25-republicans-not-vote-john-boehner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vote against John Boehner</a> for House Speaker after Boehner allegedly deceived Stutzman and other representatives into voting for the <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/12/12/cromnibus-gops-answer-bipartisan-budget/" rel="noopener noreferrer">"cromnibus" budget bill</a> in December.&nbsp;Stutzman received <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/03/marlin-stutzman-government-shutdown_n_4034123.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">national attention</a> during the government shutdown in 2013 when he said, "We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this, and I don't know what that even is.‚Äù</p>

<p>Marlin Stutzman's&nbsp;likely departure from the U.S. House means that his current constituents will have an opportunity to elect a new face to represent them.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is unlikely that a person of the opposite party or no party will replace Stutzman. It cannot be ruled out, however, that a current state legislator might seek the congressional seat, which might lead to a change (albeit small) in the composition of Indiana's state legislature as well.</p>
