<p>Ellis Island's 1900s Immigration Processing Center opened the gates for many new immigrants who were seeking a new life in the United States. As the melting pot of the world, it is obvious that we have various layers of immigrant cultures from all over the world. Some people assimilate and others hold on to a piece of their homeland's pride and cultural customs.</p>

<p>In the past 100 years, America has been witness to the acceptance or rejection of immigrants, and the truth is many people in this country have ancestral roots that can be traced back to another country.</p>

<p>In a striking interview, journalist <strong>Jorge Ramos</strong> spoke with <strong>Ann Coulter</strong> about the publication of her book, "<em>Adios, America!</em>" Her tirade about culture, immigration, and racism might not be historically correct, yet there are many who share her viewpoint or strongly oppose it.</p>

<p>Ann suggests that "we can share our culture with other nations without bringing all of their people here. When you bring the people here, you bring those cultures here." Guess what, Ann? You are 100 years too late to prevent 'other people' from coming here to achieve the "American Dream."</p>

<p>The creators of the U.S. Declaration of Independence said that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness." Furthermore, if we share our culture with other nations, how would we achieve that without becoming an immigrant in their world?</p>

<p>Moreover, Ann goes on to say, "no country has ever had the sort of respect for women than Anglo-America does..." Can we give her a&nbsp;history lesson, stat?! The 1890 Battle at Wounded Knee was a gruesome massacre on 200+ Native Americans, consisting of mostly women and children.</p>

<p>Let's not forget the history of our country and those whose culture has become nearly extinct at the cost of losing innocent lives. There should be a form of compassion and respect for each culture's history. After all, most immigrants are waiting to achieve the American Dream in the land of the free.</p>
