<p>Vice President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> spent the day on Tuesday scrambling to smooth things over with the Iraqi government, dealing with the fallout of <strong>Ashton Carter</strong>'s remarks.</p>

<p>While the White House stopped short of an apology, Carter's remark that the Iraqi military simply lacks the "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/defense-secretary-carter-iraqis-need-will-to-fight-to-defeat-islamic-state/2015/05/24/1f189454-022e-11e5-bc72-f3e16bf50bb6_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">will to fight</a>" will likely set the tone of future U.S.-Iraqi diplomatic relations, with Iraqi leaders infuriated by the implications.</p>

<p>For weeks, the Obama administration has tried to sell the effectiveness of our airstrikes against the Islamic State, yet day after day more territory and cities fall&nbsp;--with Ramadi being the breaking point last week.</p>

<p>So why could Ashton Carter tell the simple truth about Iraq that the administration could not?</p>
<h3><strong>Carter is a First-rate Military Academic, Surrounded by the World of Politics</strong></h3>
<p>Carter's career before becoming the secretary of defense was brilliant and well-respected. He may be a life-long academic and bureaucrat, but he's not a politician beholden to the party or voters.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Carter may be a life-long academic and bureaucrat, but he's not a politician beholden to the party or voters." author="David Yee, IVN Independent Author"]He, more than anyone else on the planet, has the availability at a moment's notice to have every bit of information about our military activities in Iraq at his fingertips -- and he uses this information to make decisions and judgment calls.

<p>The Iraqi military forces defending Ramadi were better equipped, (supposedly) better trained, in greater numbers, and backed by U.S. air support, and yet they still lost.</p>

<p>While a politician sees this kind of loss as a set-back, an academic of Carter's caliber wants to know why and assess blame if necessary to correct the problem.</p>

<p>He brought to the Defense Department a sense of order that the previous secretary&nbsp;of defense lacked, and concludes every meeting with a strategic planning session of what direction their decisions will take them.</p>

<p>This is something the entire American involvement in the Middle East has lacked: honest introspection of where our actions will lead us in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Freedom is Earned, Not Given</strong></h3>
<p>If we take anything away from Memorial Day, we should understand the principle that freedom is earned, not given.</p>

<p>This has been one of the policy disasters of the Middle East -- that the U.S. was playing the role of liberator and spreading freedom.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="The Pottery Barn rule still applies: we broke it, now we buy it and own it." author=""]Our&nbsp;"allies" in the Iraqi government are over a barrel. On one hand, they want to have blustery rhetoric about how we will only use this as an excuse to "re-invade." On the other hand, they're afraid we won't come to the rescue.

<p>At some point, the president's&nbsp;administration and the American people need to decide how we will proceed. The Pottery Barn rule still applies: we broke it, now we buy it and own it.</p>

<p>The administration has walked a fine line of diplomacy, one of trying to keep all sides on the world stage happy. But Carter's simple truth reduces our actions to a simple question:</p>

<p>We're going to eventually have to deal with the Islamic State, but will&nbsp;we do it with "allies" who won't stand their ground and fight for their own freedom?</p>
