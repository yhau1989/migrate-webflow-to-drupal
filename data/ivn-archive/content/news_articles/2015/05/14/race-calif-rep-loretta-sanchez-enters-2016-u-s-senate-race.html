<p>U.S. Rep.<strong> Loretta Sanchez</strong> (D-Garden Grove) formally announced her <a href="http://www.loretta.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">candidacy</a> to replace outgoing U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D) on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Orange County Democrat joins an ever-growing field of candidates, which includes: California Attorney General <strong><a href="http://www.kamalaharris.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamala Harris</a></strong> (D), Oceanside Assemblymember <strong><a href="http://www.rockychavezforsenate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocky Chavez</a></strong> (R), former GOP Chairman <strong><a href="http://www.delbeccaroforsenate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Del Beccaro</a></strong>, and attorney <strong><a href="http://albertsonforsenate.com/about-stewart/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stewart Albertson</a></strong> (R).</p>

<p>The race will be the first time an open U.S. Senate seat will be decided under the state's new nonpartisan, top-two primary system, which was adopted in 2010. It will also be the first time in 24 years that one of the state's 2 Senate seats will be vacant.</p>

<p>In a state where 44 percent of registered voters are Democrats, a November 2016 election featuring two Democratic candidates is possible, but hasn't been seen before in a statewide race. In 2012, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D) didn't face much opposition from within her own party and easily defeated Republican Elizabeth Emken, 62.5 percent to 37.5 percent.</p>

<p>Sanchez made <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/14/us/after-days-of-counting-dornan-race-is-too-close-to-call.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">national headlines</a> in 1996 when she upset incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dornan in a very close election. The race came down to less than 1,000 votes and she has represented the Orange County area ever since.</p>

<p>Despite her notoriety, a statewide race presents unique challenges for Sanchez. The current favorite, Kamala Harris, has a clear fundraising advantage and has already held and been re-elected to a statewide office. However, the new dynamics in California can mean the race isn't as cut and dry as some pundits predict.</p>
