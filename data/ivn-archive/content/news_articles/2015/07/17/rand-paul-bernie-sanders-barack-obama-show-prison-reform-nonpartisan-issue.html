<p><span>In a historic move, President <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a> became the first sitting U.S. president to visit a federal prison, in an effort to draw national attention to the need for reform in the American criminal justice system. &nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><span>"These are young people who made mistakes that aren't that different than the mistakes I made and the mistakes that a lot of you guys made.&nbsp;</span><span>The difference is they did not have the kinds of support structures, the second chances, the resources that would allow them to survive those mistakes,” he told&nbsp;reporters at&nbsp;</span><span>El Reno Federal Correctional Institution outside of Oklahoma City.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Six inmates were selected to participate in a 45-minute conversation with the president, which we can expect to see on HBO’s <em>Vice</em> in the fall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This comes just days after he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/31/president-obama-grants-commutations" rel="noopener noreferrer">granted clemency</a> to 46 prisoners who spent many years in prison, and faced many more for&nbsp;</span><span>non-violent, drug offenses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span> [pullout_blockquote quote="Prison reform is not a progressive idea, nor is it a pillar unique to the Republican agenda -- it’s a nonpartisan issue." author=""]“If they’d been sentenced under today’s laws, nearly all of them would have already served their time,” Obama explained.&nbsp;Incarceration of prisoners, who&nbsp;</span><span>often times have only been charged in non-violent drug offenses, he says,&nbsp;accounts for over $80 billion a year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prison reform is not a progressive idea, nor is it a pillar unique to the Republican agenda -- <strong>it’s a nonpartisan issue</strong>,&nbsp;with members from&nbsp;all&nbsp;political ideologies seeing the need for an overhaul in our current criminal justice system.</span></p>
<p><span>Back in 2014, Democratic U.S. Senator <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/cory-booker" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cory Booker</strong></a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/13/rand-paul-criminal-justice-reform_n_6866702.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">teamed up</a> with Republican U.S. senator and 2016 presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rand Paul</strong></a> to address the issue of overcrowding in prisons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Setting party labels aside, Obama recently <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/07/14/obama-credits-rand-paul-for-being-right-about-prison-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer">commended</a> Paul for his consistency on the issue.
</span></p>
<p>“As Republican senator and presidential candidate Rand Paul has said, to his credit he has been consistent on this issue, ‘imprisoning large numbers of non-violent drug offenders for long periods of time costs the taxpayers money without making them any safer,’” Obama said.</p>
<p><span>Independent Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">on record</a> voting in favor of funding for alternative sentencing instead of more prisons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Politicians from all across the political spectrum agree: America needs prison reform. Whether or not they&nbsp;can actually work together, however, is another story.</p>
