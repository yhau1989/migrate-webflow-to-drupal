<p>One of the more anticipated campaigns for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has seemingly dropped from the national conversation and&nbsp;is struggling to raise money.</p>

<p>Called "<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/16/2011-rand-paul-most-interesting-man-in-s" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Interesting Man in the Senate</a>" by <em>Reason</em> magazine, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rand Paul</a></strong> has built his Senate career on filibustering extrajudicial assassinations and opposing the security state.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Rand Paul finished the first quarter with $7 million in campaign donations." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295666517" handle="carlwicklander" hashes=""]In the last year, Paul consistently <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/07/21/eyes-prize-rand-paul-expands-message-beyond-party-limits-ahead-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer">polled</a> close to presumptive leader <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong>. However, as the field has widened, the Rand Paul campaign has practically disappeared from national headlines.</p>

<p>The disconcerting news continued over the weekend when <em>National Journal</em> <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/rand-paul-s-super-pac-raises-just-3-1-million-smallest-total-yet-for-2016-republican-20150724" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>&nbsp;that the Kentucky senator's super PAC, America's Liberty PAC, received only $3 million for the first quarter, the lowest&nbsp;among the field's PAC networks.</p>

<p>Paul had a generous first day of fundraising when he announced his candidacy in April. He received over one million dollars in that first 24 hours, but <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rand-paul-raises-7-million/article/2568064?custom_click=rss" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished</a> with only $7 million for the entire first quarter. The average donation was $65. The result has been a campaign that has apparently stalled. As of this writing, Paul is tied with Ted Cruz in the Real Clear Politics poll <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">average</a> with 5.7%.</p>

<p>Despite the downward trend, Paul is not discouraged. On Fox News Sunday, he <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/2015/07/26/3960692_after-lackluster-fundraising-reports.html?rh=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> host Chris Wallace:</p>
<blockquote>"I'm a Republican who can win [the] independent vote . . . We have to convince enough Republicans that this is a winning message, that I could actually win the purple states, and that's what early polling shows.</blockquote>
<p>In April, Paul was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/09/politics/2016-elections-rand-paul-hillary-clinton-swing-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer">beating</a> <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> in Colorado and running close to her in Iowa and Virginia. However,&nbsp;recent head-to-head polling data for Paul has been hard to find.</p>

<p>For instance, a <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=2261" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quinnipiac</a> <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/politics/2015/07/quinnipiac-poll-leaves-out-rand-paul-2728526.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> from the past week found favorability ratings for Rand Paul on par with <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/scott-walker" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Walker</a></strong>, Bush, and Clinton in Colorado. However, the Kentuckian did not appear in the head-to-head match-ups with Republicans or Democrats.</p>

<p>Paul's diminished standing in the field could be <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2015/07/23/the-chase-donald-trump-pushes-rand-paul-out-of-the-top-tier" rel="noopener noreferrer">attributed</a> to the entrance of businessman and reality TV star <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong>. As a likely candidate for voters registering <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/out-with-the-old-parties-and-politicians/" rel="noopener noreferrer">discontent</a> with the current state of electoral politics, Paul has failed to stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>The problem was recently explicated by <em>The American Conservative</em> editor Daniel McCarthy in the <em>New York Times</em>, when he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/07/21/are-there-too-many-gop-candidates/a-line-up-of-generic-conservative-candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> the candidates' "similarities are more striking than their differences. All want to be the generic conservative candidate."</p>

<p>With a campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-mdwXKVPQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> last week featuring Paul&nbsp;cutting the tax code with a chainsaw, the senator may have been trying to alleviate the problem in an extravagant way.</p>

<p>The drop in prestige has also coincided with a few moves that have <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/pauls-unpersuasive-excuse-for-signing-the-iran-letter/" rel="noopener noreferrer">puzzled</a> and <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2015/03/10/rand-pauls-munich/" rel="noopener noreferrer">angered</a> some of Paul's would-be <a href="http://blog.independent.org/2015/07/23/standing-with-rand-maybe-take-a-seat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporters</a>. The first was when Paul signed Sen. Tom Cotton's open letter to Iran. The other was when Paul decried the subsequent nuclear deal and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/rand-paul-says-hed-support-using-military-force-if-iran-was#.yol8QPvkX" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly</a> <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/paul-endorses-military-action-against-iran/" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a> military action over the Islamic country's nuclear program.</p>

<p><a href="http://rare.us/story/the-media-just-misportrayed-rand-paul-again-on-foreign-policy-libertarians-should-stop-falling-for-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other</a> Paul <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jack.hunter.397/posts/761290387330168?pnref=story" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporters</a> <a href="http://rare.us/story/message-to-libertarian-purists-your-reason-for-hating-rand-paul-sucks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">defended</a> the senator from what is sometimes a reliance on libertarian "purism." However, one of Paul's more enduring qualities is that he is willing to buck his party on certain issues.</p>

<p>The senator has clearly distinguished himself from many of his GOP peers on executive power and government secrecy. However, his reaction to the Iran deal, which is <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/public-opinion-and-the-deal-with-iran/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> by more than half the country and nearly half of all GOP poll respondents, permits Paul to blend in to the field.</p>

<p>The first presidential <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/20/fox-news-facebook-to-host-first-2016-gop-primary-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">debate</a> will be held on August 6 and the Rand Paul campaign could revitalize itself in the polls and in the campaign coffers. It was a debate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange</a> between <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ron-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Paul</a></strong> and Rudy Giuliani that first propelled the elder Paul's presidential campaign and profile. Although, with at least ten candidates and two hours to explain their positions, there may be few opportunities to reverse the trend.</p>
