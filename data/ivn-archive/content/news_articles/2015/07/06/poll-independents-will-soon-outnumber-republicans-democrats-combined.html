<p><span> [social_blockquote quote="45% of voters now self-identify as independent." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295665414" handle="chucktodd" hashes=""]A recent <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/nerdscreen-rise-independents-n386911" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC poll</a> confirms that the partisan political environment is, in fact, taking a toll on the two major parties, with voter registration revealing that self-identified independents are the fastest growing voting bloc in America.</span></p>
<p><span>NBC&nbsp;commentators coin it&nbsp;“the rise of an 'independents’&nbsp;era,”&nbsp;reporting that in 2014 the number of people self-identifying as independent was at 39 percent, passing that of Democrats (32 percent) and Republicans (23 percent).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As of June 2015, the&nbsp;number of self-identifying independents has grown to 45 percent -- just 2 points shy of the number of Democrats and Republicans COMBINED.</p>
<p><span>"The largest political party in the United States in no longer a party at all,” NBC commentator Chuck Todd reports.&nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>"In the 31 states plus the District of Columbia where voters have to pick a party when registering to vote, unaffiliated or no party voters are now the leading political party in 12 of those state, and in a few of them, they are the&nbsp;majority of all registered voters." - Chuck Todd, NBC News</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>In Florida, a major 2016 battleground state, the number of independent voters has grown by </span><span><b>one million</b></span><span> voters in the last 10 years. Democrats have only seen an increase of 300,000 voters, and Republicans lag with just 200,000 additional voters in the same time period.</span></p>
<p><span>What does this mean for 2016? Candidates will have to start listening to the nation's&nbsp;increasingly independent-minded electorate if they want to distinguish themselves.&nbsp;</span>The only issue is, do they know how?</p>
