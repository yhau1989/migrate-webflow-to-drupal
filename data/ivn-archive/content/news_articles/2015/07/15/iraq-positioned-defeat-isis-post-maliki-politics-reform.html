<p>Since ISIS declared the establishment of its caliphate just over a year ago on June 29, 2014, it has seen its territory grow and shrink. According to one estimate, ISIS has <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.663613" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost</a>&nbsp;a quarter of the territory it once controlled in Iraq. While it still controls key cities like Mosul and Ramadi, it has also seen battlefield&nbsp;defeats since its rapid expansion last summer.</p>

<p>While progress against ISIS in Iraq can be attributed to many factors, including American airstrikes, the bravery of Kurdish <em>pesh merga</em> fighters,&nbsp;and the pushback by Iraqi forces, the catalyst for these changes lies in the political and military reforms under the government of current PM <strong>Haider al-Abadi</strong> following the conclusion&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Nouri al-Maliki</strong>'s premiership in September 2014.</p>

<p>The origins of Iraq's political and military disarray can be attributed in part to Iran's&nbsp;influence in 2010 and its diplomacy&nbsp;that&nbsp;kept&nbsp;al-Maliki in power.</p>

<p>In Iraq’s 2010 parliamentary elections, incumbent PM al-Maliki’s&nbsp;bloc of parties&nbsp;did not win the most votes. However, <strong>Ayad Allawi</strong>, the leader of the secular bloc that&nbsp;captured the plurality of votes, was unable to cobble together&nbsp;a government. In the interim, the leader of Iran’s paramilitary Quds Force, <strong>Qassem Suleimani</strong>,&nbsp;brokered a deal to keep al-Maliki in place.</p>

<p>In exchange for persuading the Shiite Sadrists to back al-Maliki, Iran was told the Iraqi government would push to have American troops exit the country by the end of 2011. The White House <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-we-stuck-with-maliki--and-lost-iraq/2014/07/03/0dd6a8a4-f7ec-11e3-a606-946fd632f9f1_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiesced</a> to this deal, despite fears on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/28/what-we-left-behind" rel="noopener noreferrer">both sides</a> about the consequences of a premature withdrawal of American forces.</p>

<p>After al-Maliki formed the new government, he began to consolidate political power. For instance, when the Integrity Commission discovered that his cabinet was involved in a network involving the issuing of contracts to fake companies, al-Maliki blocked the prosecutions and later replaced the commission’s director with an ally. Also, after Americans withdrew militarily in 2011, Maliki had the leading Sunni politician, Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, arrested.</p>

<p>Al-Maliki also controlled and politicized the country’s security forces. He became reliant on a pro-Iranian militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH), for personal security as American forces began to draw down in 2009. For much of 2011, he served as&nbsp;the acting minister of interior and defense. He also created the Office of the Commander-in-Chief to circumvent&nbsp;democratic controls, and he used his enhanced powers to create a network of patronage across the country.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/world/middleeast/graft-hobbles-iraqs-military-in-fighting-isis.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graft</a> became especially commonplace, as high-ranking military leaders used their positions to grow their own wealth.</p>

<p>Reuters quoted one American source <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/14/us-iraq-security-military-analysis-idUSKBN0EO2FK20140614" rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming</a> that senior military officials were “picked because al-Maliki values their loyalty to him over any kind of war-fighting skills.” This inexperience was exposed in June 2014, when ISIS made its rapid conquests across northern and western Iraq.</p>

<p>One such al-Maliki appointee, <strong>Gen. Mahdi al-Gharawi</strong>, not only had a <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/19/iraq-put-a-death-squad-commander-and-torturer-in-charge-of-mosul-no-wonder-isis-is-winning.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">record</a> of torture and sectarian persecution of Sunnis, but was so notoriously corrupt that he earned the nickname “General Deftar” – a reference to the 10,000-dinar note.</p>

<p>Al-Maliki had long protected al-Gharawi from persecution – that is, until the general, tasked with defending Nineveh province, was embarrassed by the swift defeat at the city of Mosul. Finally,&nbsp;al-Maliki relieved Gen. al-Gharawi of his&nbsp;position.</p>

<p>After the fall of Mosul, the country's second-largest city, Iraq's&nbsp;leading Shiite authority, <strong>Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, </strong>called on&nbsp;all able-bodied&nbsp;men to join the fight against ISIS. Distrustful of the faltering national forces, many joined local and sectarian militias.&nbsp;As the commander-in-chief, al-Maliki created an umbrella organization for these various militias called&nbsp;the&nbsp;Popular Mobilization Forces (locally&nbsp;referred to as Hashd).</p>

<p>The&nbsp;corruption and politicization of the security forces under al-Maliki, meant to cement his&nbsp;control, backfired as ISIS’s advances coincided with the upcoming parliamentary elections of 2014.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote=" Analysts contend that the Iraqis successfully held (Ramadi) for 16 months before finally being outnumbered and overpowered." author="Andrew Gripp, IVN Independent Author"]Though&nbsp;al-Maliki’s bloc garnered the most votes in the April 30 election, with the absence of a clear majority, months of <p><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2014/08/iraq-iran-prime-minister-alabadi-maliki.html#ixzz3fQ100uMZ" rel="noopener noreferrer">political bargaining</a> occurred while&nbsp;Iraq suffered several rapid&nbsp;military defeats.</p>

<p>Again, Iran served as the de facto kingmaker. In negotiations, this time Iran expressed disapproval with al-Maliki’s incompetence and divisiveness, especially as ISIS captured the city of Jalawla just 25 miles from Iran’s border. Al-Sistani told Iranians in secret that al-Maliki should be replaced.</p>

<p><em>Al-Monitor</em> <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2014/08/iraq-iran-prime-minister-alabadi-maliki.html#ixzz3fQ1C7hS5" rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted</a>&nbsp;a source saying&nbsp;that Iran wanted to "support a name that wouldn't intimidate the Sunnis and the Kurds” and eventually settled on the Shiite politician Haider al-Abadi. Several dozen lawmakers from Maliki’s bloc pledged their support for al-Abadi, and he was declared prime minister on August 11 and approved by the parliament&nbsp;on September 8.</p>

<p>Al-Abadi immediately began governing in a style opposed to that of his predecessor. Politically, he appointed a cabinet that reflected the country’s diversity. In October, the parliament <a href="http://www.aawsat.net/2014/10/article55337678/iraq-parliament-approves-new-defense-interior-ministers" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved</a> the nomination of a Sunni, <strong>Khaled al-Obeidi</strong>, as Iraq’s defense minister.</p>

<p>Al-Abadi’s government also quickly sought to undo the damage that al-Maliki had done to Iraq’s security forces. He replaced 36 top officers that had been appointed by al-Maliki.</p>

<p>His cabinet also took a significant step by&nbsp;bringing the Hashd militias under <a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2015/04/23/rise-of-iraq-s-militia-state/i7px" rel="noopener noreferrer">state control</a>&nbsp;in order to curtail the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/18/iraq-militia-attacks-destroy-villages-displace-thousands" rel="noopener noreferrer">sectarianism and mistreatment</a> of locals that had eroded&nbsp;Sunnis' trust in Baghdad.</p>

<p>This conciliatory and nationalist&nbsp;<a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2015/05/14/abadi-and-militias-political-offensive/i8ke" rel="noopener noreferrer">reform</a> was symbolized by al-Abadi’s visit to Habbaniya on April 8, where he not only celebrated the country’s recent liberation of Tikrit, but also held a swearing-in ceremony for Sunnis joining a local militia. Al-Abadi even personally handed out rifles to the new recruits.</p>

<p>To enhance accountability, al-Abadi has proposed that all new weapons dispersed to militia fights should be imprinted with serial numbers.</p>

<p>The victory in Tikrit was soon overshadowed by the loss of Ramadi in May. While U.S. <strong>Defense Secretary Ashton Carter</strong> commented that the Iraqi's showed they lacked a "will to fight" by abandoning Ramadi, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/5/26/8659859/ramadi-ash-carter" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysts</a> contend that the Iraqis successfully held the city for 16 months before finally being outnumbered and overpowered.&nbsp;The BBC also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32881854" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that the brigadier in charge of the city had been convinced that ISIS was prepared to use explosive devices in the city center and thus ordered a hasty&nbsp;retreat.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite al-Abadi's reforms and some successful military operations (including <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Jul-03/304911-iraqi-forces-say-most-of-beiji-town-recaptured-from-isis.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer">progress</a>&nbsp;in reclaiming Beiji, the site of a strategically located oil refinery), more needs to take place before the country will be prepared to defeat ISIS – especially given that an estimated 22,000 Iraqi troops have deserted their units.</p>

<p>Politically, al-Abadi's government has withstood internal&nbsp;pressure&nbsp;– most notably&nbsp;from the Shiite opposition centered around al-Maliki and pro-Iranian militias. For instance,&nbsp;it dismissed&nbsp;a call by some Shiite militias to delegate more autonomy to the Hashd after it was <a href="http://iswiraq.blogspot.com/2015/04/iraqs-prime-minister-comes-under-attack.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized</a>&nbsp;for a massacre at the military outpost of Tharthar, where a disputed number of troops were killed in an ISIS ambush. It faced <a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2015/07/01/after-ramadi-militias-in-lead/ibb8" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar criticism</a>&nbsp;and demands&nbsp;after the fall of Ramadi.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Victory against ISIS will have to come at the hands of Iraqi fighters who may be difficult to control." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295665686" handle="" hashes=""]Balancing the array of allied combatants – domestic and international –&nbsp;in the fight against ISIS will nevertheless prove to be al-Abadi's&nbsp;toughest political challenge. While it has benefited from American&nbsp;support in terms of timely airstrikes and hundreds of new personnel – including the recent&nbsp;dispatch&nbsp;of 450 Americans to <p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/7/ashton-carter-us-forces-training-500-sunnis-iraq/" rel="noopener noreferrer">train</a> Sunnis at al-Taqaddum Air Base, victory against ISIS will have to come at the hands of Iraqi fighters who may be difficult to control.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/world/middleeast/iraqi-forces-plan-offensive-to-retake-ramadi-from-isis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reclaim</a>&nbsp;lost territory in the Sunni-populated Anbar province, the government is&nbsp;trying to reduce&nbsp;its reliance on Shiite militias. Though&nbsp;state security forces are likely to lead the fight to retake&nbsp;Ramadi, it appears as though powerful Shiite militias&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-militias-vow-to-push-islamic-state-from-fallujah-site-of-tough-us-battle/2015/07/08/4b8bc8dc-24af-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be central</a> in the upcoming battle in Fallujah. Al-Abadi repeatedly stresses the nationalistic and pan-sectarian nature of the victories against ISIS, but the leaders of Shiite militias like AAH and the Badr Organization <a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2015/07/01/after-ramadi-militias-in-lead/ibb8" rel="noopener noreferrer">routinely</a> frame the military contest in explicitly sectarian terms.</p>

<p>To prevent sectarianism from interfering with the fight in Anbar, al-Sistani called on the militias to respect the property of the area's inhabitants and to make them feel safe.</p>

<p>In some battles, Sunni and Shiite&nbsp;militiamen are fighting side-by-side to defeat ISIS.</p>

<p>"We are all here. Sunni and Shi'a fight like one person. There is no difference," one fighter <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/islamic-state-releases-new-footage-showing-scenes-from-massacre-of-1700-iraqi-troops?utm_source=vicenewstwitter" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;<em>Vice News</em>.</p>

<p>In short, there is no telling when Iraq will finally defeat ISIS militarily. However, what does seem indisputable is that the political inclusiveness&nbsp;under al-Abadi and his government's reforms of the security forces leaves the country much better poised to defeat the enemy than it was under the leadership of al-Maliki.</p>
