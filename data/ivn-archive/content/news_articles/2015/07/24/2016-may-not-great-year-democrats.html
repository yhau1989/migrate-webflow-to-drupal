<p>As the 2016 election cycle continues -- spanning from the presidency to state legislatures -- the Democratic Party will have its work cut out for it as slow economic growth and declining presidential approval ratings continue to wreak havoc on its electoral prospects. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early polls</a> indicate that the Democrats may hold the White House,&nbsp;but a Republican hold on Congress and increased influence at the state and local levels may render a Democratic presidency muted.</p>
