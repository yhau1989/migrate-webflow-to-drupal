<p>The <strong><a href="http://independentvoterproject.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent Voter Project</a></strong> (IVP) and <strong><a href="http://www.cafwd.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Forward</a></strong> (CA Fwd) invite you to an exciting event in Sacramento, California. On <span><span>August 19</span></span>, we will hold a series of panel discussions on voting rights, nonpartisan primaries, and the future of elections.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="This is about giving more voters a voice." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295666248" handle="Steve_Glazer" hashes=""] Panelists and special guest speakers include: California Secretary of State <p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/alex-padilla" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Padilla</a></strong>, California State Senator <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/steve-glazer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Glazer</a></strong>, State Senator&nbsp;<strong>Anthony Cannella</strong>, and Assemblymembers <strong>Brian Maienschein</strong>, <strong>Lorena Gonzalez</strong>, <strong>Adam Gray</strong>, and <strong>Cheryl Brown</strong>.</p>

“The [nonpartisan] top-two primary system is changing California politics for the better," Senator Glazer remarked. "As candidates and legislators reach across partisan boundaries to appeal to all voters of a district, you begin to see pragmatic policy making eroding the hyper-partisan power at the Capitol. This is about giving more voters a voice.”

<p>We invite you to join the legislators, policy experts, academic leaders, and election analysts for a lively discussion on voting rights and the future of nonpartisan election reform.</p>

<p>For more information and to RSVP, click <a href="http://www.independentvoterproject.org/primary_summit" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><span>The event is free and open to the public. </span></p>
