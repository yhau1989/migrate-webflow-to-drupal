[gravityform id="87" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]According to&nbsp;a Gallup poll released on July 24, <p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong>'s favorability has continued to drop to a net unfavorable position -- even with her remaining head and shoulders above the rest of the Democratic pack in both favorability and name recognition.</p>

<p>For the first time since the 2008 election, Clinton polls with an "unfavorable" (46-43) status nationwide among all voters. But this drop might not matter much when comparing Clinton to her opposition.</p>

<p>This election is going to come down to which candidate can grab those critical points in a handful of&nbsp;battleground states; the smallest of percentages in 7 or 8 states might be the difference between&nbsp;victory or loss. Within these critical points are the swing voters, the moderates, and the independents, who historically don't gravitate toward the far left or far right in elections.</p>

<p>While Republicans are fielding a huge number of candidates -- 16 declared -- there are very few willing to campaign on appealing to the "middle" after Mitt Romney's resounding defeat in 2012.</p>

<p>Even <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong>, who was once seen as a more moderate choice, has been courting far-right ideals -- such as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/politics/jeb-bush-medicare-comment-new-hampshire/" rel="noopener noreferrer">eliminating Medicare</a>&nbsp;-- to try to gain momentum in the 2016 race.</p>

<p>As far as center appeal goes, the Democrats are even worse this election cycle.</p>

<p>Of the 5&nbsp;Democrats running, three-fourths of Americans don't even know or have an opinion on the three bottom listers: O'Malley, Webb, and Chafee.</p>

<p><strong>Martin O'Malley</strong>'s recent dabbling into <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/gerrymandering" rel="noopener noreferrer">gerrymandering</a>, and the subsequent trials, make him about as damaged as a Democrat could possibly be to the party faithful.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jim-webb" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jim Webb</strong></a> has all the credentials a Democrat could ever want -- decorated war hero, solid service in the Senate, secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration, and a prolific writing career.</p>

<p>What Webb doesn't have is a solid message, national appeal, and a national framework for winning the primary.</p>

<p><strong>Lincoln Chafee</strong> has the appearance of a growing number of politicians willing to switch political allegiances whenever convenient, and is a hodgepodge of political beliefs that really doesn't fit within any political framework.</p>

<p>And then there's <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders</a></strong> and Hillary Clinton, both embracing -- to varying degrees -- the new Democratic populist strategy.</p>

<p>The socialist/populist strategy is an old-hat for Sanders, who has been running on these values since his first attempt at office in 1971. And other than living on an <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Sanders.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Israeli commune (kibbutz)</a>&nbsp;and dabbling in <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/young-bernie-sanders-liberty-union-vermont" rel="noopener noreferrer">political smut writing</a> in the style of Henry Miller, Sanders has been a career politician in one of the "bluest" of the blue states.&nbsp;How Sanders would fare in the "purple" battleground states is impossible to predict, and the primary will be a tell-tale sign.</p>

<p>There has also never been a Jewish president or vice president in American history. However, the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vsSlAzk2OoQC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=gore+lieberman+hurt+by+jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAWoVChMI3orw4Kr2xgIVApWICh38fAEt#v=onepage&amp;q=gore%20lieberman%20hurt%20by%20jewish&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">2000 election</a> seemed to indicate that it would be a non-issue politically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton, a more recent convert to the new progressive strategy, has gone all-in with her "<a href="http://ivn.us/2015/06/17/hillary-clinton-four-fights-for-you-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Fights For You</a>" strategy.</p>

<p>But Clinton comes with 20-plus years of baggage associated with being in the political spotlight.&nbsp;Clinton's strength, even with the baggage, will be in her ability to keep the party in lockstep, something that Sanders is unlikely to be able to accomplish.</p>

<p>This new progressive campaigning style is not without its risks, and could severely backfire on the Democrats.</p>

<p>If the Republicans can field a candidate with a strong economic agenda, tough immigration policy, and trade agenda favoring American products, the so-called Reagan-Democrats in the Rust Belt would almost certainly defect from the Democrat's progressive strategy.</p>

<p>This would almost certainly lose the election for the Democrats, as there is no path to victory without the Rust Belt.</p>

<p>The sad reality is, no matter how unfavorable Clinton might become, it will all depend on the candidate she faces in the general election -- because moderates, swing voters, and independents may&nbsp;be voting more as a statement against her opponent than for her, her appeal, or her message.</p>
