<p>Republicans and Democrats have been accused of being two arms of the same corrupt political body -- the two-party system. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jeb Bush</strong></a> are demonized by each other, by their opponents, and even by factions within their own parties. All the while, they are seen as moderates on the political spectrum, and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/237802-clinton-has-inevitability-but-bush-has-the-electoral" rel="noopener noreferrer">practically inevitable</a> as the two leaders who will end up on the presidential ballot in 2016.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton doesn't speak a foreign language, and Jeb Bush didn't go to Yale. These differences may be surprising, and so might some of their similarities. For two 'inevitable' candidates, they have more in common than you might think. Here are 30 ways Jeb Bush is just like Hillary Clinton:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Hillary and Jeb were both anti-Vietnam.</p>

<p>2. They were both for the Iraq war.</p>

<p>3. Held anti-Palestinian stances during <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/topic/operation-protective-edge" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Protective Edge</a>.</p>

<p>4. They project <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-signal-of-distaste-for-dynasties-bodes-ill-for-bush-clinton/2015/01/10/079258f2-98d3-11e4-8385-866293322c2f_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">entitlement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Bush and Clinton represent a political class that is seen as living lives apart from those they represent, people who are seen as out for themselves rather than for ordinary people."
- Dan Balz, Washington Post</blockquote>
<p>5. Negatively viewed as members of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bush-clinton-and-the-mixed-appeal-of-political-dynasties/2014/12/16/6ecfaaac-8545-11e4-9534-f79a23c40e6c_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">political dynasties</a>.</p>

<p>6. Both favor a path to citizenship for immigrants vs. deportation.</p>

<p>7. They think immigrants are a source of vitality for the USA:</p>
<blockquote>"Immigrants keep America young and dynamic."- Hillary Clinton, <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Hillary_Clinton.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">On The Issues</a>

&nbsp;

"Immigrants are an engine of economic vitality."- Jeb Bush, <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Issues</a></blockquote>
<p>8. They both carry <a href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2015-06-15/political-dynasties-and-the-2016-presidential-race" rel="noopener noreferrer">baggage</a> from their political dynasties.</p>

<p>9. They condemn Edward Snowden's NSA leaks. Clinton says if he wants to come home, he will be <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/hillary-clinton-edward-snowden-108579.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">held accountable</a>, and Bush vows <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/247023-bush-no-leniency-for-snowden" rel="noopener noreferrer">no leniency</a> toward Snowden.</p>

<p>10. They've been accused of hiding documents: Hillary's infamous <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/235007-gowdy-months-of-clinton-emails-missing" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a> case; and Jeb's court battle over <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/Next_Bush_Technology.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">open records laws</a>.</p>

<p>11. Support for welfare to work incentives including: increasing employment and job training programs for welfare recipients, providing tax incentives to businesses that hire welfare recipients, providing child care for welfare recipients who work, and increasing access to public transportation for welfare recipients who work.</p>

<p>12. Agree the Confederate flag is racist. Jeb Bush removed the flag from <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/jeb-bush-s-clear-record-on-the-confederate-flag-20150622" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida's</a> capitol in 2001.</p>

<p>13. Both support the death penalty.</p>

<p>14. Hillary <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/04/20/what-hillary-clinton-said-about-the-common-core-state-standards/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supports</a> Common Core national education standards. Bush is the only Republican candidate that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/us/politics/bush-says-he-has-backbone-on-common-core.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">supports</a> common core, and says it's a 'national priority.'</p>

<p>15. <a href="http://www.marijuana.com/blog/news/2015/04/where-do-presidential-candidates-stand-on-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Against</a> legal marijuana.</p>

<p>16. However, they support states experimenting with legalization.</p>

<p>17. They're environmentalists. <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/jeb-bush-everglades-115655_Page5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a> 'took on the biggest environmental restoration project in American history' by conserving Florida's Everglades. Hillary "has always been committed on it [the environment], and she’s voted right very consistently," according to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-goes-green" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gene Karpinski</a>, president of the League of Conservation Voters.</p>

<p>18. Hillary says that <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2015/06/15/hillary-clinton-climate-change-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate change</a> is a defining threat of our time. Jeb Bush is also 'concerned' about <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/239210-jeb-bush-concerned-about-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate change</a>.</p>

<p>19. Supported the bank bailouts of 2008.</p>

<p>20. Agree that corporate pay is out of control. Hillary is <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Social/Hillary_Clinton_Corporations.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">'outraged by corporate pay.'</a> Jeb thinks inflated corporate pay without merit is a threat to capitalism itself:</p>
<blockquote>"Large rewards for great results can still be attacked, but they're very defensible. But if the rewards for CEOs and their teams become extraordinarily high with no link to performance - and shareholders are left holding the bag - then it undermines people's confidence in capitalism itself."- Jeb Bush</blockquote>
<p>21. Both support the controversial Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership (TPP).</p>

<p>22. Hillary and Bush signed on to the <a href="http://www.25x25.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">25X25</a> pledge, committing to 25% renewable energy by 2025.</p>

<p>23. Oppose storing nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain. <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/05/14/ap-review-journal-miss-jeb-bushs-yucca-mountain/203648" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb says</a>, 'the community doesn't want it,' and Hillary is concerned about a <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=92565" rel="noopener noreferrer">fault</a> that lies beneath the mountain.</p>

<p>24. Each supports<a href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/where-does-hillary-clinton-stand-on-fracking/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> fracking</a>. Bush is invested in <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2015_02/jeb_bush_conveniently_started054319.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">fracking</a>.</p>

<p>25. Each has haunting corporate ties:</p>
<blockquote>"Bush enlisted the firm’s lobbyists to help him write speeches, provided private glimpses of public policy to lobbyists and reversed his positions to support policies that helped their clients."-<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/jeb-bush-campaign-says-its-encouraged-support-corporate-lobbyists-1981718" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Business Times</a>

&nbsp;

"Hillary Clinton was one of the most aggressive global cheerleaders for American companies, pushing governments to sign deals and change policies to the advantage of corporate giants such as General Electric Co., Exxon Mobil Co., Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co."-<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clintons-complex-corporate-ties-1424403002" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a></blockquote>
<p>26. <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/bush-family-ties-155745" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb</a> and <a href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-hillary-clinton-and-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary</a> have family ties to the oil industry.</p>

<p>27. They make a pretty penny on speaking engagements. $10 million for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-30/the-complete-list-of-jeb-bush-s-paid-speaking-gigs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bush</a> since 2007. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/05/hillary-clinton-goldman-sachs-private-equity-white-house-2016" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary</a> made $5 million in the first half of 2014.</p>

<p>28. Both have high <a href="http://surveys.ap.org/data%5CGfK%5CAP-GfK_Poll_July_2015%20Topline_Clinton.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">unfavorable ratings</a>. Jeb's is 44%. Hillary's is 49% -- beat out only by Obama and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>29. They believe in the <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a2820/4260504/" rel="noopener noreferrer">future of space</a> flights. Jeb calls himself a '<a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/jeb-bush-im-a-space-guy" rel="noopener noreferrer">space guy</a>.'</p>

<p>30. Chided by conservative talk show hosts to run on the other party’s ticket. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/06/11/oreilly_hillary_clinton_should_run_as_a_republican.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill O'Reilly</a> told Hillary to run on the Republican ticket; <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/twenty-sixteen/laura-ingraham-jeb-bush-and-hillary-clinton-should-run-on-the-same-ticket-20150227" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Ingraham</a> told Jeb to run with the Democrats.</p>
