[gravityform id="31" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]This week, New Jersey Gov. <p><strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/chris-christie" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Christie</a></strong> told residents in states where recreational marijuana use is legal to smoke their weed now because when he is president he will enforce federal laws.</p>

<p>In a town hall meeting in Newport, New Hampshire, Christie told users of legal marijuana,&nbsp;"If you're getting high in Colorado today, enjoy it." He continued, "As of January 2017, I will enforce the federal laws."</p>

<p>Christie believes marijuana use alters the brain and is a gateway drug to harsher substances, a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-28/smoke-that-pot-now-christie-tells-users-in-states-that-allow-it" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg article</a>&nbsp;explains.</p>

<p>Despite <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/6-facts-about-marijuana/" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing support for marijuana legalization</a> nationwide, Christie strongly opposes it. Other Republican candidates, such as Florida Governor <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jeb-bush" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeb Bush</a></strong> and Texas Sen. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ted-cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Cruz</a></strong>, implied they will leave the issue up to the states to decide.</p>

<p>If Christie is hoping to stand apart from the other Republican candidates, this issue might not be the one to do so. In 2012, a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/114941164/Marijuana-and-Medical-Marijuana-after-the-2012-Election" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News survey</a> found that 65 percent of Republicans think marijuana legalization should be left up to states to decide.</p>

<p>Christie criticized President Obama for selectively choosing which laws to enforce. The New Jersey governor&nbsp;explained in a <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-june-7-2015-christie-de-blasio/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Face the Nation</em> interview</a> that some residents of Colorado are unhappy with legalization and he is committed to telling the truth, despite the possibility of losing the state if chosen as the Republican nominee.</p>
