<p><span><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a>, the 73-year-old independent Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate, has taken the Internet by storm, earning the title “king of social media” and "Facebook royalty."</span></p>
<p><span>The online success of Sen. Sanders can be summed up in one, simple word: <strong>Authenticity</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Authenticity: noun,&nbsp;the&nbsp;quality&nbsp;of&nbsp;being&nbsp;<span>authentic</span>;&nbsp;genuineness.</span></em></p>
<p><span>His posts do not follow what the so-called “experts” have pronounced as the equation for success and he breaks almost every rule provided by Facebook Bests Practices.</span></p>
<p><span>[pullout_blockquote quote="I play a very, very active role in writing, literally writing, what goes up there on Facebook,." author="U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)"]His posts are long and wordy, void of trending keywords or Internet memes. Unlike most campaign social media accounts, he is producing the language and the vision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Usually, it’s in the shower where something pops into my head,” Sanders said in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wants-to-be-president-but-hes-already-facebook-royalty.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times interview</a>. “I play a very, very active role in writing, literally writing, what goes up there on Facebook,” he adds.</span></p>
<p><span>His official campaign page has accumulated over 745,000 likes. That doesn’t even begin to capture his online reach, which includes his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/senatorsanders?fref=ts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politician Page</a> (</span><span>with over 1.3 million likes) and the dozens of community pages created by enthusiastic voters, eager to mobilize voters in their state (think: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CA4Sanders2016" rel="noopener noreferrer">California for Bernie Sanders</a>).</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more telling of his online success is the number of people who are actually engaging with him on Facebook, a number measured by Facebook’s “Talking About” number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On his campaign page, for instance, there are over 325,000 people interacting with his posts on Facebook. By contrast, <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a>’s Facebook Page only has around 175,000 engaged and active followers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The moral of the story? Our generation responds to authenticity, not catch phrases or buzzwords.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“He can post a quote graphic or a long text-only Facebook status, and it doesn’t really matter what the algorithm favors,” Laura Olin, head social media strategist for President Obama’s 2012 campaign <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wants-to-be-president-but-hes-already-facebook-royalty.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>. “If it sounds like him,” she said, “his people will find it and spread it.”</span></p>
<p><span>[social_blockquote quote="When the people stand together we can win." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295665471" handle="BernieSanders" hashes=""]His authenticity has far reaching implications that extend far beyond the limitless bounds of cyberspace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Vermont senator used his authenticity to raise over $15 million in just three months. While he still lags behinds Clinton, who set the record for the largest primary haul for a candidate’s first three months with $45 million, he now has a chance at a real campaign.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"</span><span>I don't represent large corporations and I don't want their money. We have the people. And when the people stand together we can win,”&nbsp;reads a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/posts/860658833989122" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Post from July 2</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>So far, he has been a man of his word, with 99</span><span>&nbsp;percent of the almost 400,000 contributions by some 250,000 individuals amounting to $250 or less. This means that he has a large pool of willing and enthusiastic donors to turn to come 2016.</span></p>
<p>His&nbsp;focus on the individual&nbsp;donor and his approach to social media has set him up to give Hillary a run for her money, literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>Will this be enough to take on the Clinton Legacy?</p>
