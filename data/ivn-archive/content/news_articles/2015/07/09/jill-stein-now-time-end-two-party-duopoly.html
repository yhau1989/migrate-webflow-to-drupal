 said there is "[n]o greater waste of a vote than to keep voting for the two political parties that keep throwing you under the bus." Stein argues that the current election system leaves voters with only one option, and that is to choose the lesser of two evils.<p>In a <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/jill-stein-voting-for-bernie-sanders-is-like-voting-for-another-obama-endless-war/207277/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview</a> with Mint Press News, Green Party presidential candidate <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jill-stein" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jill Stein</strong></a></p>

<p>"And Americans are growing weary of the status quo. Indeed, over 58 percent of Americans believe a third U.S. political party is needed because the Republican and Democratic parties <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/177284/americans-continue-say-third-political-party-needed.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">“do such a poor job”</a> representing the American people," Mnar Muhawesh of Mint Press News writes.</p>

<p>Stein says she is committed to offering the American public more choices. She even argues that <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a>, who for some represents an alternative despite running on the Democratic ticket, endorses <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In her interview, Stein explains that idealistic campaigns, like Barack Obama's, Hillary Clinton's, and Bernie Sanders' are not in it for the long haul. Their resources and vision get "folded into a political party run by an oligarchy hostile to that vision."</p>

<p>Stein supports the current case against the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/fec" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Federal Elections Commission</strong></a> (FEC) for limiting presidential debates to only Republicans and Democrats. The law states that debates must be "nonpartisan" and not "bipartisan," she argues.</p>

<p>She is hopeful that the case against the FEC will open up debates to third-party candidates who represent more choices for the American public. Stein concludes that the "American public is already there...we don't need to change people's minds." She argues that we only need to alter the institutions currently limiting increased and diverse participation.</p>
