<p><strong>[gravityform id="94" title="false" description="false" ajax="true"]Jon Stewart</strong> is known for taking some of the biggest news stories in the media and making them funny, giving audiences an opportunity to hear about important things happening in the nation and world around them in an entertaining way. However, when it came to the tragedy in Charleston, South Carolina, Stewart had no jokes to write.</p>

<p>"I didn't do my job today," Stewart said in the beginning of his monologue. "Maybe if I wasn't nearing the end of the run or if this wasn't such a common occurrence, I could have pulled out of the spiral, but I didn't ... I honestly have nothing other than sadness."</p>

<p>For 5 minutes, Jon Stewart broke character to give arguably one of the most impassioned rants ever on his show. Stewart explicitly called the shooting in South Carolina a terrorist attack and expressed frustration over the fact that America will spend tens of billions chasing ISIS and Islamic terrorists around the world, but we won't do anything about these incidents of domestic terrorism.</p>

<p>"We still won't do jack s--t," he remarked.</p>
<blockquote>"What blows my mind is the disparity of response between when we think people that are foreign are going to kill us and us killing ourselves." - Jon Stewart, <em>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em></blockquote>
<p>Mother Jones said the segment is "probably the most important video we've seen in months."</p>

<p>However, while many people do not disagree with Stewart calling this a terrorist attack or that racism is still a problem in the U.S., some people were more concerned about the gun control aspect of the debate even though Stewart said from the very beginning that he didn't want to get into those political debates.</p>
