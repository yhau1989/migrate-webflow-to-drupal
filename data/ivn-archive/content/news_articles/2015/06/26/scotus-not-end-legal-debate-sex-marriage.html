<p>To be honest, I'm a bit surprised at today's Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Not in the outcome -- in my mind that was all but a foregone conclusion. But instead, in the way it played out.</p>

<p>I was banking on one of two things: a convoluted split-majority opinion that would force the issues to be fought out in the lower courts for more years to come while upholding current pro-rulings, or a unanimous decision in favor.</p>

<p>Obviously, the tactic of the convoluted decisions on same-sex marriage is nothing new; it's been the tactic of SCOTUS for at least a decade. For them to continue this path would be just maintaining the status quo, something the courts have always been especially good at.</p>

<p>But on pressing civil rights decisions, especially landmark decisions, justices don't like to have their legacy "on the wrong side of history."</p>

<p>Decisions like <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> (1954) were far from universally endorsed by the justices at first, but the court realized that such a landmark ruling would need unanimous consent to make it stick (as well as the "wrong side of history" issues).</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Yes, support of same-sex marriage is increasing, but it is far from universal in agreement." author="David Yee, IVN Independent Author"]<p><em>Brown</em> was heard by the Supreme Court twice, an unusual event -- and then Chief Justice Warren kept circulating majority opinions that were revised until everyone could sign on.</p>

<p>Today's decision is different, because it falls largely along ideological lines, and those ideological lines represent about a 50/50 (maybe a <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/08/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">60/40 in favor</a>) split in American opinion.</p>

<p>Yes, support of same-sex marriage is increasing, but it is far from universal in agreement -- one way or the other.</p>

<p>This is where SCOTUS made its error. The court is now going to be a political target for the 2016 election and implementation of same-sex marriage will probably continue to be fought out in the courts at every stage.</p>

<p>It's not like there isn't already a huge faction of&nbsp;Americans, especially conservatives, who believe the courts overstep their authority "by legislating from the bench." A non-unanimous decision fuels this opinion, and keeps alive the divide.</p>

<p>Also, without a unanimous opinion, the idea of a "glimmer of hope" remains where there will be challenges against the implementation of same-sex marriage at every stage, from bakers refusing to make cakes to churches refusing to accept lawful marriages. It's going to be endless.</p>

<p>In many ways, I feel that today's decision was the worst of the two paths. A convoluted decision would have given America more time to increase its acceptance of same-sex marriage, while also giving the courts more time to build unanimous consent.</p>

<p>But SCOTUS has the final word on judicial matters, and while same-sex marriage is now a reality nationwide, we are still far from over hearing about court cases involving it.</p>
