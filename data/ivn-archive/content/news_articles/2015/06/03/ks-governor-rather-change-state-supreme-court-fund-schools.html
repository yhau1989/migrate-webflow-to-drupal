<p>Kansas Governor <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/sam-brownback" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sam Brownback</strong></a>'s (R) so-called <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-kansas-tea-party-disaster-20141023?page=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">tea party experiment</a> in supply side economics has thrust&nbsp;the normally quiet politics of solidly-red Kansas into the national spotlight. With the first round of tax cuts <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-03/brownback-faces-blowback-as-kansas-tax-cuts-shutter-classrooms" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly bankrupting the state</a>, Brownback and supporters in the legislature have scrambled to make up the short-fall with a blend of more cuts, along with a few increases in taxes.</p>

<p>But all of this has been under the watchful eye of the Kansas Supreme Court. The court handed the Brownback administration several setbacks when it <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/17/lessons-learned-sambrownbackkansascutstoeducation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled against budget proposals that cut school funding</a> in 2014.</p>

<p>The deep tax cuts created a $700 million shortfall in revenues, but the justices were unsympathetic as they ordered an additional $548 million a year in school spending. The court ruled that <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article5175489.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-imposed fiscal dilemmas</a> could not be used as an excuse to underfund mandated school budgets. Kansas law had a specific formula for funding school districts, one that the courts stated was not being followed.</p>

<p>In short, Brownback has few friends in the Kansas judicial system. First elected in 2011, Brownback has only had the opportunity to appoint one justice to the court -- and while that justice has been faithful to Brownback's policies, it hasn't been enough to sway the court's decisions.</p>

<p>Brownback's allies temporarily circumvented some of the court's rulings by changing the funding laws for Kansas schools in 2015. But <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article16333310.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">this new law</a> -- replacing a 23-year-old funding law -- has already been challenged by school districts and is awaiting action in district courts before eventually going before the Kansas Supreme Court.</p>

<p>As a result of the changes, at least <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-04/kansas-schools-close-early-as-brownback-tax-cuts-squeeze-revenue" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 different school districts</a> closed their doors early in 2015 because of budget constraints, with many more reducing positions and cutting programs for the 2015-2016 school year.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="At least 8 different school districts closed their doors early in 2015 because of budget constraints" author="David Yee, IVN Independent Author"]Brownback and his allies in the legislature have a plan -- if they can't win in the courts, they will just change the judges. At least seven&nbsp;changes to the way Supreme Court justices are chosen and/or retained have been put forth, many&nbsp;of which would require a change in the Kansas Constitution.

<p>Justices are <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/kansas-courts/supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently appointed</a> by the governor from a list selected by an independent nominating commission. After the first year, the justice is subject to a retention vote in the general election. If retained, the justice then faces a retention vote every six years.</p>

<p>Brownback put forth two suggestions in his State of the State speech of either moving to a federal-type system of governor nomination, senate confirmation, or establishing the direct election of justices. Both of these ideas would require a constitutional amendment.</p>

<p>Other ideas include making judges subject to <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2015_16/measures/hcr5003/" rel="noopener noreferrer">recall elections</a>, like all other elected positions in Kansas; requiring a <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2015_16/measures/documents/hcr5009_00_0000.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-thirds retention</a> vote to remain in office; expanding the <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2015_16/measures/sb297/" rel="noopener noreferrer">grounds for impeachment</a>&nbsp;to include what is popularly called "legislating from the bench"; lowering the mandatory retirement age for justices to <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article8071974.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">65-years-old</a>; and possibly <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/final-front-sam-brownbacks-battle-control-kansas" rel="noopener noreferrer">splitting the Kansas Supreme Court</a> into two bodies -- one for civil cases and one for criminal.</p>

<p>All of these proposals have one goal in mind: making it much easier to create a conservative court that is sympathetic to the Brownback administration.</p>

<p>But this is also a smoke-and-mirrors ploy, since the Brownback administration doesn't even have the full support of the Republican-dominated state legislature.</p>

<p>With Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 3-to-1 in both the Senate and House, the Kansas Legislature still cannot pass a budget that both fills the shortfall and stays true to the governor's tea party experiment.&nbsp;To many on both sides of the aisle, the budget failures and the new proposals for the Supreme Court are <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article8071974.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">inextricably linked</a>.</p>

<p>Now in the thirteenth day of <a href="http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/Legislations-Overtime-Session-Could-Furlough-State-Workers-305625931.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">legislative overtime</a>, costing the state over $40,000 per day, a budget deal is still far from closed. With the fiscal year ending in<a href="http://www.kmbc.com/news/kansas-state-employees-face-furloughs-without-budget-deal/33318544" rel="noopener noreferrer"> early July</a>, furloughs of government workers will be imminent if a budget is not reached before the deadline -- non-essential workers will be given furlough notices beginning on June 7.</p>

<p>Kansas' budget experiment is likely to be a key issue in the 2016 presidential election, with both moderate Republicans and Democrats seeing it as a complete failure of supply-side economics. Short of a miraculous economic turnaround, Gov. Brownback has given his political enemies a "perfect" example of the dangers of lowering taxes&nbsp; and expecting to make up the difference by increased production and commerce.</p>

<p>While Kansas will more than likely vote solidly red in the 2016 election, it will still be one of the most important battleground states of the race -- an ideological battleground where both sides will try to put the best spin possible on Kansas' failed tax-cut experiment to win over voters.</p>
