<p>On Wednesday night, a gunman opened fire at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Nine people total were killed. The man identified as the primary suspect in the shooting, Daryl Roof, was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/us/charleston-church-shooting.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">taken into custody</a> by police in Shelby, N.C. on Thursday. Witnesses say Roof stood up in the church and said he was there "to shoot black people."</p>

<p>The tragedy in Charleston has stunned the nation and many politicians from the President of the United States to 2016 presidential candidates have expressed their sympathies and outrage on social media and other outlets. Here are some of those responses:</p>
<h4><strong>U.S. President Barack Obama</strong></h4>
<blockquote>"Now is the time for mourning and healing, but let's be clear: At some point as a country, we have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It is in our power to do something about itâ€¦ I say this knowing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those opportunities." - President Obama, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-church-shooting-president-obama-deliver-remarks-n377726" rel="noopener noreferrer">6/18/15</a></blockquote>
