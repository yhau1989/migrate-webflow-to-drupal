<p>U.S. Representative <strong>Bob Goodlatte</strong> (R-Va.) is trying to set the record straight about Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) -- the so called "fast-track" for authorizing the <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/trans-pacific-partnership" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trans-Pacific Partnership</strong></a> (TPP). In an email sent out on Thursday, Goodlatte fact checks the most common misconceptions about TPA and the TPP.</p>

<p>While some lawmakers want voters to believe that TPA would lead to all sorts of outcomes -- including forfeiting our national sovereignty, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/10/revealed-the-secret-immigration-chapter-in-obamas-trade-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more illegal immigration</a>, and creating a "<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/06/10/sessions-warns-tpa-would-create-pacific-union-akin-to-european-union/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacific Union akin to the European Union</a>" --&nbsp; Goodlatte points out that the TPA is not a trade agreement so there is no way it could possibly do any of these things.</p>

<p>The TPP is the trade agreement and there are some misconceptions about what fast-tracking the agreement means. Here's what the Virginia representative says you need to know:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Congress is not voting on any trade agreement this week. </strong>There are no finalized trade agreements even eligible for consideration. If the President were to agree to one in principle <span><span>tomorrow</span></span>, it could not be voted on in the House <a href="http://email.geniusmailer.com/ct/28349080:27216517365:m:1:422070366:8A9657C552D3278C8D8D00B0176E9762:r" rel="noopener noreferrer">for many months</a> and <u>would be required to be made public for at least 60 days prior to a vote</u>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>TPA does not cede American sovereignty over any aspect of our nation’s laws, regulations, or Constitution. </strong>American law <a href="http://email.geniusmailer.com/ct/28349081:27216517365:m:1:422070366:8A9657C552D3278C8D8D00B0176E9762:r" rel="noopener noreferrer">can only be changed by Congress</a> and agreed to by the President.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>TPA gives <em>Congress and the American public</em> greater oversight of any proposed trade agreements.</strong> It puts strong checks and balances in place to guarantee the American public has transparency over the process. The House of Representatives would have the power to “switch-off” TPA if the President doesn’t follow the law or congressional intent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Free trade creates American jobs, strengthens the economy, expands American export markets, bolsters national security, and is a fundamental principle behind <a href="http://email.geniusmailer.com/ct/28349082:27216517365:m:1:422070366:8A9657C552D3278C8D8D00B0176E9762:r" rel="noopener noreferrer">a free market economy</a>. </strong>Trade Promotion Authority will increase choices and lower costs for Sixth District farmers, workers, consumers, and businesses.</li>
</ul>
