<p>My <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/05/06/interview-with-jill-stein/" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/jill-stein" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jill Stein</strong></a> changed my mind drastically about how I look at voting.</p>

<p>"Our values should be the driver of democracy," she said.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Our values should be the driver of our democracy." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/2015/06/11/jill-stein-changed-my-mind/" handle="@drjillstein" hashes="#election2016 #greenparty"]The first year I could vote for president was 2000. George Bush was running against Al Gore, and Green Ralph Nader was a third party candidate. I voted my values; I voted for Nader. That was the first and last time I thought of voting as an exercise of free will.

<p>The backlash I got from all corners of my social circles was severe -- "I was the reason Bush won," "How could I be so stupid as to take votes away from Gore," "Now look what I have done!"</p>

<p>As the years passed, it was obvious I made a grave mistake. Super-nationalism and a sharp political shift to the right after 9-11, <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/bushrecord/" rel="noopener noreferrer">backtracking</a> environmental gains of the 1990s, and worst of all, the Iraq War, have all weighed heavily on my conscience.</p>

<p>Until I had the privilege of interviewing Jill Stein for IVN, I had made up my mind -- I would strategically vote in a manner that will make sure my vote does not threaten what I hold dear as an American: civil rights, conserving natural resources, and good international leadership. I would sacrifice voting for a candidate I liked if it&nbsp;meant a candidate who stands against my values did&nbsp;not win.</p>

<p>What is the difference between voting for my values and voting against "not-my-values"? I already outlined the crucial difference in one of my first published articles,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/09/26/50-reasons-why-you-should-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Reasons Why You Should Vote</a></em>:</p>

<p>I quoted IVN readers, Eric and Rachel Jones:</p>
<blockquote>24. “If people won’t vote for good candidates…because we think they won’t win, why will good candidates continue to run?” - Eric and Rachel Jones</blockquote>
<p>And my own strong sentiment born of a realist nature:</p>
<blockquote>20. If you don't vote for your interests, who will?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, many of the reasons listed in <em>50 Reasons Why You Should Vote&nbsp;</em>are inherent in the notion that we should "vote our values" as Stein suggested. Voting against "not-my-values" instead of <em>for</em> my values was, as Stein pointed out, "the politics of fear." At least, she was right in my case -- I was voting out of fear.</p>

<p>In fact, voting out of fear was the first assault on my values, and there are wide-ranging, salient consequences that follow: I can't represent my interests if I do not stand up <em>for</em> my own interests; there will never be a candidate that will support my interests if I don't support that leader simply because he or she may not come out on top. Democracy is a competitive art, and if I am not competing with my true interests, my interests will surely lose.</p>

<p>Voting outside of my true will, and out of fear negates most of the noble reasons for voting I listed in <em>50 Reasons to Vote</em>:</p>
<blockquote>6. “Without the vote of a free man, I am but a slave without power to make decisions.” – Gary Olson

&nbsp;

10. So you can complain with integrity.

&nbsp;

19. We build our nation with votes

&nbsp;

21. “A wise man will not leave what is right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority.” – Henry David Thoreau</blockquote>
<p>So, instead of fear, I must believe in something that I have largely abandoned: Hope.</p>

[pullout_blockquote quote="Democracy is a competitive art, and if I am not competing with my true interests, my interests will surely lose." author="Kathryn Bullington, IVN Independent Author"]I spoke out against Bush II, even though I was violently attacked by loyal 'patriots'; I protested against moving American Indians from Yucca Mountain, and installing a nuclear waste depository; I railed against the Iraq War in 2002, when CIA officials made it clear that the Bush administration was data mining for false information -- it didn't make a difference. Super-nationalism has morphed into a bitterly divided extreme political culture in the U.S., and our environment and international integrity seem to be plummeting, despite the election of Democrat <p><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/barack-obama" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a>.</p>

<p>One thing I push for, and I questioned Dr. Stein about in our interview, is citizen action. It is a core American value for me to be active in politics -- to vote, to attend city council meetings, and contact my representatives. Stein made me think deeper about the consequences of my actions. As Thoreau campaigned in <em>Civil Disobedience</em>, it is not enough to merely vote -- one must take actions to propel public virtue. But what is the effect of my civic actions without, as Stein put it, a political voice?</p>
<blockquote>"We have to fight these battles on a policy level."- Jill Stein</blockquote>
<p>I want my interests to have a political voice, and they will never if I do not find and support candidates who amplify my position. When it comes time to vote, if a candidate I support is not on the list, I will still vote for the lesser of two evils, according to who&nbsp;can <em>better </em>represent me.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I am on a mission to find that candidate that I can support to fight for my interests on a policy level and support them, with the hope that together we can build a better tomorrow. I haven't found a candidate like this yet, but I will not give up -- I will not diminish my voice and values to the power of the majority.</p>
