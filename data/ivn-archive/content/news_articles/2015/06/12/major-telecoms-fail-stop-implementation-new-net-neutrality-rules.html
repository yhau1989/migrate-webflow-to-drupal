<p>The FCC's new net neutrality rules went into effect Friday despite an effort by several broadband providers and telecom associations to get a federal court to issue a stay on the rules. The court denied the request.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reports:</p>
<blockquote>"While some net neutrality enthusiasts were celebrating the court win, <strong>another attempt to thwart the regulations made progress in the House</strong>. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/10/republicans-take-aim-at-net-neutrality-in-spending-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerPost reported</a> Wednesday that language in <strong>an appropriationâ€™s bill would prevent the FCC from using federal dollars to implement the rules</strong> until after pending litigation is settled. Our colleagues at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/06/11/this-is-the-gops-new-tactic-to-stop-net-neutrality/?wpisrc=nl_tech&amp;wpmm=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Switch write</a> that the language got a thumbs up from the House financial services subcommittee." - PowerPost, June 12, 2015</blockquote>
<p>The future of net neutrality is still unclear. House Republicans will likely continue to fight it. Also, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/06/11/court-refuses-to-halt-fcc-rules-net-neutrality-rules-go-into-effect-on-friday/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a>, a full hearing on the new rules will take place later this year.</p>
