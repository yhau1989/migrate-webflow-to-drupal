<p>A presidential candidate is <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/redacted-911-report-rand-paul-ron-wyden-118413.html#ixzz3blQyunaG" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling</a> for the release of 28 pages from the 9/11 Commission Report that&nbsp;could alter the race and the way Americans view the event.</p>

<p>Kentucky U.S. Sen. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/rand-paul" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rand Paul</strong></a>, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, will introduce the Transparency for the Families of 9/11 Victims Act this week alongside Sen. <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/ron-wyden" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ron Wyden</strong></a> (D-Ore.). Wyden has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/03/06/democratic-sen-ron-wyden-joins-rand-pauls-filibuster/" rel="noopener noreferrer">allied</a> with the Kentucky Republican previously on privacy and government secrecy issues. The legislation would declassify 28 redacted pages of the report.</p>

<p>Another of Paul's Democratic cosponsors, Sen. <strong>Bob Graham</strong> of Florida, has said in the past:</p>
<blockquote>"The 28 pages primarily relate to who financed 9/11, and they point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as being the principal financier."</blockquote>
<p>Declassifying the pages of the report has long been an objective of conspiracy theorists, but also government transparency activists. One of Paul's House allies, U.S. Rep. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/24/independent-republican-walter-jones-faces-tough-primary-challenge-n-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter</a> <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/02/24/partisans-threaten-independent-rep-walter-jones-incumbency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jones</a></strong>&nbsp;(R-N.C.), has <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/09/08/rep-walter-jones-leads-effort-declassify-full-911-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">made</a> the declassification of these pages a legislative priority.</p>

<p>Jones has read the pages in question and <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-911-george-w-bush-barack-obama-prince-bandar-bin-sultan-bob-297170" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> that their release would not harm national security. <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/search/Thomas+Massie" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Massie</a></strong>, another of Paul's GOP allies, said in 2014 that the pages changed his "understanding of history."</p>

[social_blockquote quote="80% think the Patriot Act is too powerful in collecting and storing information." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295663890" handle="ACLU" hashes=""]The bill is only the latest move Rand Paul has made that may separate him from his fellow presidential aspirants. He recently led a <p><a href="http://ivn.us/2015/05/20/breaking-rand-paul-filibusters-patriot-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quasi-filibuster</a>, bringing attention to the lack of privacy safeguards in the Patriot Act. His efforts paid&nbsp;off at least <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/senate-meets-key-patriot-act-provisions-ropes-070238067--politics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporarily</a>&nbsp;as he forced&nbsp;an expiration of some of the legislation's powers on Sunday.</p>

<p>However, the issue has also exposed divisions between Paul and several others in his party. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a rumored candidate, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/bobby-jindal-rand-paul-unfit-president-118322.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Paul's foreign policy pronouncements are the "most liberal Democratic" positions and they make Paul&nbsp;"unsuited" to serve as commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>John Sununu, former chief of staff to President George H. W. Bush, recently <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/30/sununu-any-republican-better-than-hillary-except-rand-paul/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that any GOP candidate should be supported against Hillary Clinton except Paul. Sens. <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/314641-mccain-voting-between-rand-paul-and-hillary-clinton-would-be-tough-choice" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McCain</a>&nbsp;(R-Ariz.) and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/05/lindsey-graham-rand-paul_n_7006858.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsey Graham</a>&nbsp;(R-S.C.) have both offered similar statements in the past.</p>

<p>When debates and noteworthy <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/11/25/iowa-governor-terry-branstad-seeks-elimination-of-straw-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer">straw polls</a> begin to occur, the rift between Paul and other candidates may come to the fore. However, Americans by and large have desired a reform to government secrecy.&nbsp;An ACLU poll earlier this year <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/poll-majority-americans-want-patriot-act-reformed-332991" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> that 60% of respondents thought the Patriot Act should be reformed while more than 80% were "concerned" the act was too powerful in "collecting and storing" personal information.</p>

<p>Early polling collected by Real Clear Politics also shows Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio running the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/" rel="noopener noreferrer">closest</a>&nbsp;to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Though Rubio and many other Republicans usually represent different outlooks from&nbsp;Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator's latest move could become one of the factors that separates the candidates.</p>
