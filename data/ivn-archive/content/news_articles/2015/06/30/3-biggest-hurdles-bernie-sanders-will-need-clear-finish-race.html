<p>As the&nbsp;number of Republican presidential candidates grows on a seemingly daily basis, the Democratic field is slowly becoming more crowded. It now includes <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a>, <strong><a href="http://ivn.us/tag/martin-omalley/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin O'Malley</a></strong>, Lincoln Chafee, and <a href="http://ivn.us/tag/bernie-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a> (I-Vt.).</p>

<p>While Sanders entered the race as a distant second to Clinton, his campaign has gained <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read-what-bernie-mentum-tells-us-n376951" rel="noopener noreferrer">momentum</a>. Nevertheless, in the months ahead, his campaign will face three particular challenges.</p>

<p>One potential challenge for Sanders could be&nbsp;gaining ballot access across the country.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, there has been a debate as to whether Sanders would be able to appear on Democratic Party ballots, given that Sanders is politically an independent.</p>

<p>New Hampshire, for instance, requires candidates to fill out a form stating their party registration. However, Vermont – like 19 other states -- does not have party registration, so Sanders cannot simply change his party affiliation to “Democrat" before submitting his paperwork.</p>

<p>Yet&nbsp;this technicality is <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/24/416929786/this-quirky-new-hampshire-law-might-keep-sanders-off-the-ballot" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlikely</a> to keep Sanders off the ballot in New Hampshire. Previous presidential candidates have been able to appear on a party’s ballot in the state because of their espousal of that party’s ideals, or because the candidate has appeared on party ballots in other states. Sanders – who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate and who has received the party’s nomination in Vermont – clearly satisfies both criteria.</p>

<p>The state’s party chairman has assured the public, "At the end of the day, Sen. Sanders will appear on the New Hampshire Democratic Party ballot.”</p>

<p>A similar <a href="http://observer.com/2015/06/can-bernie-sanders-appear-on-the-democratic-primary-ballot-in-new-york/" rel="noopener noreferrer">debate</a> over ballot access occurred in New York, where officials at first suggested that Sanders would be kept off the ballot by citing the state’s Wilson-Pakula law, which prevents non-party members from receiving a party’s nomination.</p>

<p>Yet after ballot access expert Richard Winger <a href="http://ballot-access.org/2015/06/19/various-new-york-politics-blogs-publish-misleading-information-about-bernie-sanders-ability-to-be-on-new-york-democratic-presidential-primary-ballot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">weighed in</a> and observed that New York’s primary does not nominate a presidential candidate – a function performed by the national party at its nominating convention – election officials <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/06/8570676/elections-board-bernie-sanders-can-appear-primary-ballot" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> Sanders would be able to appear on the ballot after all.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Sanders ... is all but guaranteed ballot access for the earliest and most momentous state contests." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295665075" handle="" hashes=""]Sanders, therefore, is all but guaranteed ballot access for the earliest and most momentous state contests, including Iowa and New Hampshire, where, according to <p><a href="http://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2015/06/25/bernie-bits-bloomberg-poll-shows-sanders-surging-in-iowa" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest polls</a>, he is chipping away at Clinton’s leads.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some contests&nbsp;will be more difficult than others – especially in larger states later on in the campaign, and they speak to&nbsp;a second challenge&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Sanders campaign: fundraising.</p>

<p>Sanders, a consistent critic of the role of money in politics, has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-03-26/bernie-sanders-hates-money-in-politics-the-very-thing-he-ll-need-to-beat-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">sworn</a> not to rely on an affiliated super PAC or to accept donations from wealthy donors. Instead, he has solicited contributions&nbsp;of small amounts – sometimes as little as $5. With an average donation of $40, Sanders has thus far raised approximately $8 million. He aims to raise $50 million before the Iowa caucuses take place on February 1, 2016.</p>

<p>These figures pale in comparison to those of his primary competitor, Hillary Clinton. Since officially launching her campaign, she has already <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2015/06/24/clinton-takes-a-just-enough-strategy-to-fundraising" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised</a> $17 million – a figure that does not include the millions raised by her supporting super PACs. Some <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-fundraising-goal-2-billion-118183.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">anticipate</a> that Clinton's campaign could raise as much as $2 billion.</p>

<p>This paucity of funds can inhibit Sanders from establishing a strong presence on the ground in larger states, where organizing a staff and mobilizing supporters will be a greater challenge for Sanders than it will be for Clinton, who leads him in terms of resources and political connections.</p>

<p>Unlike Clinton, who is running a professional&nbsp;and systematic&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/239725-clinton-campaign-launches-nationwide-organizing-push" rel="noopener noreferrer">"50-state" strategy</a>, Sanders is instead launching an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/bernie-sanders-plan-to-beat-hillary-clinton" rel="noopener noreferrer">early-states-first</a> strategy fueled by grassroots support. In recent weeks, he has delivered speeches to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/" rel="noopener noreferrer">large crowds</a>&nbsp;– many of them drawing thousands&nbsp;– in cities such as&nbsp;Des Moines, Minneapolis, and Denver.</p>

<p>Such events will be a significant component of Sanders' campaign, since he lacks the means – and desire –&nbsp;to&nbsp;bombard the airwaves with slick television ads touting his credentials and taking swipes at his Democratic opponents. Sanders has <a href="http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2015/04/why-bernie-sanders-hates-negative-ads.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">sworn</a> not to run a negative campaign or issue attack ads, so his&nbsp;limited presence in the mainstream media may be to his benefit.</p>

[social_blockquote quote="With an average donation of $40, Sanders has thus far raised approximately $8 million." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295665075" handle="" hashes=""]Still, Sanders'&nbsp;campaign faces a larger problem with the media, which poses as his third challenge. In the months and <p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-feb-9-2014-n25856" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a> prior to Hillary Clinton's&nbsp;official campaign announcement, the media treated the lack of declared primary challengers as a sign that her victory in securing the party's nomination was "inevitable."</p>

<p>Given the media's <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/melissa-mullins/2015/04/18/inevitable-clinton-drool-parade-has-begun" rel="noopener noreferrer">fascination</a> with the Clintons and the politics of celebrity, Sanders and the media will be engaged in a kind of meta-struggle: Sanders will want to talk at length about the issues in his usual forceful way, whereas the media will <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/wolf-blitzer-baffled-by-bernie-sanders-free-college-plan-but-what-about-hillary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">impatiently interrupt </a>his statements and try to&nbsp;turn the primary contest&nbsp;into a <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2015/0601/Bernie-Sanders-and-Chuck-Todd-s-Meet-the-Press-fiasco-50-shades-of-bad" rel="noopener noreferrer">battle of personalities</a>.</p>

<p>Because of&nbsp;his political independence and strictly&nbsp;out-of-necessity association with the&nbsp;Democratic Party, his grassroots and populist campaign strategy, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v06ztuSoBB4" rel="noopener noreferrer">hot</a>-and-<a href="http://www.occupydemocrats.com/watch-bernie-sanders-blows-lid-off-the-corporate-medias-biggest-secret/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cold</a> relationship with the media, it is clear that Sanders' campaign is not only about trying&nbsp;to secure the party's&nbsp;nomination: he is also waging a campaign against the "traditional" campaign itself. And that may be his greatest challenge of all.</p>
