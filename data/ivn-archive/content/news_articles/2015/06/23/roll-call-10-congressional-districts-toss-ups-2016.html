<p>Roll Call reported Tuesday on efforts by both major parties to secure an election win in Texas' 23rd Congressional District, the only competitive district in the state. This is not a new development. The border district has been the only competitive congressional district in Texas for years, switching often between Republican and Democratic representatives depending on what type of election year it is.</p>

<p>Roll Call reports:</p>
<blockquote>With only <a href="http://media.cq.com/raceratings/?pos=opol" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 seats rated as Tossups</a> by the <a href="http://www.rothenberggonzales.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political Report</a>/Roll Call, both parties are treating this Mexican-border-district <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/two-former-members-announce-comeback-bids/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rematch</a> as a top-tier race.

&nbsp;

Just days after then-Rep. <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/44851.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Gallego</a>, 53, lost by 2 points to former CIA operative <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/30933.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Hurd</a>, 37, last November, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/house-democrats-eyeing-five-rematches/" rel="noopener noreferrer">urged</a> Gallego to run again. DCCC Chairman <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/28688.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Ray Luján</a> is hosting a fundraiser for him next week.

&nbsp;

As 1 of only 6 Republicans seeking re-election in a Tossup district, Hurd has already been a <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/dccc-robocalls-dhs-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer">top target for Democrats</a>, who would need to net&nbsp;30 seats to win control of the House, while the National Republican Congressional Committee made him<a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/nrcc-patriot-program-2016/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> an initial member of its Patriot Program</a>, which&nbsp;helps defend vulnerable members.

&nbsp;

But for Republicans, holding on to Hurd’s seat goes beyond defending their majority. As 1 of 2 African-Americans in the House Republican Conference, Hurd’s presence in Congress goes a long way toward bolstering the party’s efforts to diversify.</blockquote>

<p>That's right. Only 10 congressional seats are considered competitive in 2016, out of 435 total seats in the U.S. House. That's a little over 2 percent of the total seats. Two percent!</p>

[social_blockquote quote="Tens of millions of voters will have little say in who ends up representing them in 2016." hyperlink="http://ivn.us/?p=23295664891" handle="" hashes=""]Presidential election years historically have much higher voter turnouts than midterm election years, and many are hoping for a major resurgence in voter participation after the record-low turnout in 2014.

<p>However, even with the boost in voter participation, tens of millions of voters will have little say in who ends up representing them. With the number of "battleground states" at an estimated 7 or 8, the Republican and Democratic parties will focus almost exclusively on this small handful of districts and states while ignoring the rest of the national electorate.</p>

<p>After decades of <a href="http://ivn.us/search/gerrymandering" rel="noopener noreferrer">partisan gerrymandering</a> and the creation of <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/04/06/accepting-primary-election-circus-paying/" rel="noopener noreferrer">election laws</a> that give two private corporations lasting dominance in the electoral process, voters are justified in believing that their <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/05/07/voice-really-doesnt-matter-princeton-study-confirms/" rel="noopener noreferrer">voice doesn't matter</a> because elections in much of the country put political parties first -- not voters.</p>
