<p>Today’s U.S. Supreme Court decision was a strong affirmation of California’s independent redistricting process and constitutional right of voters to prevent self-interested gerrymandering by state legislatures.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, the court granted a victory to the power of voters and their authority to enact important reforms through voter-led initiatives.</p>

<p>A vibrant democracy requires citizen involvement. That is why California Forward worked hard to pass Proposition 11 in 2008 and to support the successful implementation of Props 11 and 20. CA Fwd believes the public must reassert its ownership of government to restore the capacity of legislatures to respond to and resolve critical public issues.</p>
