<p>Almost one year away from the 2016 primary, one North Carolina representative is already facing a primary challenge.</p>

<p>Since beginning his opposition to the Iraq war, U.S. Rep. <a href="http://ivn.us/search/walter+jones" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Jones</a> of the 3rd district -- and one of the more independent members of Congress -- has been a thorn in the side of his party and its leadership. In 2012, Jones was <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2015/06/23/meet-the-11-republicans-punished-by-house-gop-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stripped</a> of his position on the House Financial Services Committee and in 2014 faced the toughest <a href="http://ivn.us/2014/03/24/independent-republican-walter-jones-faces-tough-primary-challenge-n-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary</a> challenge of his political career. Winning that primary with only 51%, it was <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/jones-fends-off-the-hard-liners/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reasonable</a> to think his party antagonists would <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/02/24/partisans-threaten-independent-rep-walter-jones-incumbency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">try again</a>.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the Weekly Standard <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/clear-sailing-jones_978229.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that one of the more promising potential challengers to Jones, state transportation secretary Anthony Tata, was not going to run. A retired brigadier general and West Point graduate, the loss of Tata may move Jones' party rivals to support another candidate, Phil Law.</p>

<p>A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and a "<a href="http://www.kinston.com/article/20150319/News/303199980" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a> development supervisor" for Hewlett-Packard in Jacksonville, Law announced his candidacy in March. Taking issue with Jones' effectiveness as a representative, he <a href="http://www.kinston.com/article/20150319/News/303199980/?Start=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> local media, "Jones talks a good talk but he doesn't actually get anything done."</p>

<p>Law also addressed what he felt was the problem with 2014's challenger, Taylor Griffin. Law <a href="http://www.kinston.com/article/20150319/News/303199980/?Start=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "he was the wrong man" for the job:</p>
<blockquote>"He wasn't from North Carolina - he lived in DC - he was sent down, he was an operative, he was a registered lobbyist. And a lot of outside money, which Jones pointed out, backed him."</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to predict which issues Law might challenge Jones on because the 11-term congressman has amassed a conventionally conservative voting record. Opposing executive amnesty for illegal immigrants, executive orders on <a href="http://jones.house.gov/issue/second-amendment" rel="noopener noreferrer">gun control</a>, and the Affordable Care Act, Jones was also ranked #39 on the Club for Growth's most recent scorecard, finishing ahead of party favorites Paul Ryan and <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2014/01/23/cathy-mcmorris-rodgers-will-give-gop-state-of-the-union-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cathy McMorris Rodgers</a>.</p>

<p>In a review of the "Issues" tab on Law's campaign website, on only two topics is Jones mentioned or alluded to: National Security and Veterans Issues. Jones' skeptical views on intervention post-2003 are well-known. On veterans issues, Law <a href="http://www.law4congress.com/issues/veterans" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticizes</a> Jones for being one of five <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll467.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer">members</a> in the House to vote against a veterans bill. However, Jones issued a press release at the time explaining his reasoning.</p>

<p>Arguing that the proposed bill, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014, would add "$10 billion in deficit spending" and amount to a new entitlement, Jones <a href="https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-votes-against-misguided-unsustainable-va-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> that he could not support a bill while allowing:</p>
<blockquote>"...the current broken system to remain in place and increasing federal spending at a time that our national debt has already reached $17 trillion."</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the vote came after Jones had survived the primary. An argument for fiscal responsibility could fall on deaf ears in a district housing the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base, although Walter Jones has weathered the storms for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>The difference will likely be whether any other candidates enter the race or if sufficient numbers of Republican hawks will support and energize Law's campaign.</p>
