<p>Donald Trump announced Tuesday his intentions to run for president in 2016. While many treat Trump's candidacy as a joke, he insists that he is the real deal.</p>

<p>"Our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now," Trump said <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/16/414913035/donald-trump-is-in-promises-to-make-america-great-again" rel="noopener noreferrer">during his announcement speech</a>. "We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again."</p>

<p>Donald Trump believes he is that leader. Whether people take his candidacy seriously or not, he has the money, he has the name recognition (i.e. the celebrity), and he has actually <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/16/414609787/5-things-you-should-know-about-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">won a presidential primary</a> before (bet you didn't know that).</p>

<p>Here are 10 reasons why (at least in his view) Trump's candidacy should be taken seriously:</p>
<h4><strong>1. "I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created." - Donald Trump, 6/16/15</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>2. He is original.</strong></h4>
<p>https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/596338364187602944</p>
<h4><strong>3. In fact, he plans to make the whole debate over entitlements <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/donald-trump-2016-election-hillary-clinton-95515.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">irrelevant</a>.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>"I don’t think I’d be cutting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. I think what I do is make the country so rich, you wouldn’t have to bother." - Donald Trump, 8/13/13</blockquote>
<h4><strong>4. He has a <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/28/donald-trump-declines-share-his-foolproof-plan-win/" rel="noopener noreferrer">foolproof plan to defeat ISIS</a> (that he is strategically keeping close to the chest).</strong></h4>
<blockquote>“I don’t want the enemy to know what I’m doing,” he said. “Unfortunately, I’ll probably have to tell at some point. But there is a method of defeating them quickly and effectively and having total victory. I don’t want to be Obama where he goes on television to explain exactly when we’re going to attack a certain city, what we’re going to do, what hour we’re going to be using for the attack, how many men are going in — I don’t want to do that.” - Donald Trump, 5/27/15</blockquote>
<h4><strong>5. But he plans to make ISIS "<a href="http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-on-2016-and-trolling-the-gop/" rel="noopener noreferrer">very, very nervous</a>."</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>6 He is going to make America great... again.
</strong></h4>
<p>https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/609823516670693379</p>
<h4><strong>7. He knows how to <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Donald-Trump-president-border-wall/2015/01/26/id/620769/" rel="noopener noreferrer">build walls</a>.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>"We have to build a wall. ... Look, I build some of the greatest buildings in the world. Building a wall for me is easy. And it would be a wall. It would be a real wall. Not a wall that people walk over." - Donald Trump on immigration, 1/26/15</blockquote>
<h4><strong>8. "I don’t need a super PAC, because I’ll spend my own money." - Donald Trump, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/05/21/the_donalds_presidential_ambitions_126673.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">5/19/15</a></strong></h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>9. He has <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/05/21/the_donalds_presidential_ambitions_126673.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a> from the people.
</strong></h4>
<blockquote>“People would come up and say, ‘Mr. Trump we’d love for you to run. We know you aren’t going to, but can we have a picture with you?’” - Donald Trump</blockquote>
<h4><strong>10. Trump can <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/donald-trump-president-run-2016-announcement-20150616" rel="noopener noreferrer">trump China</a>.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>"When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time, all the time" - Donald Trump, 6/16/15</blockquote>
