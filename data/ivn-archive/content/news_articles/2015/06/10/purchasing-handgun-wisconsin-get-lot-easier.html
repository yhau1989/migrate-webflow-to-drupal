<p>Wisconsin lawmakers recently approved a new law that will eliminate the state's 48-hour waiting period to purchase a handgun, which has been in place since 1976. Reports indicate that Governor <strong>Scott Walker</strong> (R) is expected to sign the bill without hesitation.</p>

<p>From the Sun Times:</p>
<blockquote>The legislature also approved a measure to allow off-duty and retired law enforcement officials to carry guns on school property.

&nbsp;

Both bills have been sent to Walker, and his office said he’ll sign the bill repealing the 48-hour waiting period, but his reserving judgment on the school-carry bill until he can fully evaluate it.

“This important measure marks the end of an antiquated law that’s served as nothing but a needless burden on law-abiding gun owners in the Badger state,” <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20150609/nra-scores-victory-in-wisconsin-with-passage-of-sb-35-repealing-48-hour-waiting-period" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Chris W. Cox</a>, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action. “We applaud the state legislature for making the preservation of Second Amendment rights a priority.”</blockquote>
<p>Opponents of the bill stress that the two-day "cooling off" period is important because it can prevent crimes of passion, using heated domestic disputes as an example.</p>
