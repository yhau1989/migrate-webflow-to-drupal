<p>Governor Schwarzenegger's proposed sales tax hike isn't what meets the eye, <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23910.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> Joseph
Henchman of the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Foundation</a>. The governor says that the state tax rate is
currently 5 percent, but this isn't entirely true.</p>



<blockquote><p>"Schwarzenegger can get away with calling the current tax '5 percent'
because carved out special taxes can become essentially autonomous funding
sources, like Minnesota's new 3/8th sales tax for wildlife refuges and arts and
culture programs or Colorado's failed 0.2% sales tax for developmentally
disabled care programs."</p></blockquote><p>The lowest sales tax rate in the state is actually 7.25 percent. In Los Angeles for example, Prop. R just bumped its sales tax from 8.25 percent to 8.75 percent, and if the Schwarzenegger plan goes through, it will be right around 10 percent. </p>

<p>As the old saying goes, there are lies, damn lies, and then there's
statistics.</p>
