<p>In Monty Python's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp_l5ntikaU" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;">"Monty Python and the
Holy Grail"</a>, a group of angry peasants drags a young woman into the
town square and demands that she be burned at the stake because she is a witch.
When the local authority questions their rationale, the villagers reply that
they know their victim is a witch because "she looks like one." It is
later revealed that the costume and disgustingly long nose that the
"witch" apparently possesses were placed on her by the villagers to
artificially fortify their case.</p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p>This scene is naturally supposed to
be comedic, for the obvious miscarriage of justice depicted is too absurd to be
otherwise. However, California is
currently witnessing <span>a
similar</span><span> </span>miscarriage
of justice against innocent people for no crime other than that their religious
affiliation or even <span>their skin color</span>
looks politically unfriendly. As in the case of the Monty Python sketch, this
appearance has more to do with the bigotries and cruelty of the persecutors
than with the actual innocence or guilt of the accused. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I refer to the disgraceful behavior
of the protesters of Proposition 8. As the long-time readers of this Web site
know, I am no friend of this measure, and I have <a href="/article/proposition-8/2008/10/20/whats-name" rel="noopener noreferrer">made as much clear</a>. But the behavior of the protesters
against Proposition 8 is more embarrassing and wrongheaded than the proposition
itself could ever be. This behavior includes <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-protest7-2008nov07,0,3827549.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">blatant religious bigotry</a> and <a href="http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/2008/11/n-word-and-raci.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">racism</a>, neither of which are justified by anything other
than arguably tenuous connections between the proposition and those attacked. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There have been numerous
demonstrations all around the state at Mormon churches, not to mention the
airing of several anti-Mormon ads which do nothing but tar Mormons as vandals
and bigots. The protesters claim this behavior is not about religion; it is
used solely as an attack on a politically engaged entity – namely, the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This argument is inconsistent with both
the principles of justice and of logic. It is true that the LDS church has
contributed support to Proposition 8, but to condemn<span> </span>every
Mormon for being a member of that church is equivalent to condemning every
Muslim for being a terrorist. It is a fallacy of composition to claim that just
because a large population of a church believes something, therefore the entire
church believes it. There are theological disagreements in any religious
community, the Mormons included, and to target this group specifically evinces
a predatory desire to construct one's opposition by stepping on the backs of
the least politically popular proponents of a policy. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But even if one excuses the abuse
of the LDS church as a response to high-profile political advocacy, there is no
excuse for the racism. <a href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=8077" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pam's
House Blend</a>, a blog that covers lesbian issues, has detailed some of the more vile
incidences: </p>



<blockquote><p> "It was like being at a Klan rally except the
Klansman were wearing Abercrombie polos and Birkenstocks. 'You n*****r,' one
man shouted at men. 'If your people want to call me a F****t, I will call you a
n*****r.'"</p></blockquote><p>

 Several liberal media organizations, such as <a href="http://www.truthwinsout.org/blog/truth-wins-out-condemns-racial-intolerance-within-the-lgbt-community-following-proposition-8-defeat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth Wins Out</a> and <a href="http://site.pfaw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_equality_prop_8_memo" rel="noopener noreferrer">People for the American Way</a> have denounced this behavior in
unequivocal terms. Truth Wins Out issued a statement  condemning
"those in the LGBT community who have emulated our bigoted opponents by
scapegoating minorities," while Kathryn Kolbert of People for the American
Way has written that "responding to [Proposition 8's passage] by lashing
out at African Americans is deeply wrong and offensive - not to mention
destructive to the goal of advancing equality." To their credit, even the
organizers of protests against Proposition 8 have <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/archives/2008/11/07/lets-not-blame-the-brown/#comment-343580" rel="noopener noreferrer">made a few timid noises</a> disavowing their intention to stir
this level of cruelty.</p>



<p>It is disturbing indeed that in a
debate where level-headed argument about the purpose of constitutional
amendments should prevail, this sort of irrationality is occurring. In what
world do these protesters live, where unless you are gay and
secular-progressive, you deserve no respect, no pity, no mercy? And to make
matters worse, because the opponents of Proposition 8 cannot stand to see their
ideas rejected on a level playing field, now they are trying to invoke a constitutional
crisis by trying to get the California Supreme Court to rule on something which
by definition is beyond their power to oppose – a constitutional amendment.
This hideous contempt for the rule of law must be defeated, and so must the
cruelty and ignorance of its noisiest backers. Only then can a substantive
debate over Proposition 8 be rekindled.</p><p> </p>
