<p>Regarding “Rethinking San Diego's waterfront” (Opinion, Jan. 26):</p>

<p>The Ron Roberts-Steve Peace plan is the most comprehensive and sensible&nbsp;development concept presented to the people of San Diego in the last 50 years.&nbsp;It includes practical and economic solutions to the many current and future&nbsp;problems of airport operation, ground traffic relief, cruise ship and maritime&nbsp;expansion, and, most important, protection of San Diego's “front porch” – our&nbsp;priceless waterfront.</p>

<p>I pray the city, the Port District, the Airport Authority, and the private&nbsp;sector will give this well-conceived blueprint for progress the study and&nbsp;implementation that it deserves, and the sooner, the better.</p>
