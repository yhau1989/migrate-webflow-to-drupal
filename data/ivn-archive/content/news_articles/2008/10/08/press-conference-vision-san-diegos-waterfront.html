Erie and Scott A. MacKenzie (Op-Ed) March 11, 2007 <strong>Steve Peace and Supervisor Ron Roberts held a special presentation January 30, 2007 to present a new vision for San Diego's waterfront.</strong></p>

<p>LOCATION:</p>

<p><strong>The Holiday Inn on the Bay</strong></p>
<p>1355 North Harbor Drive</p>

<p><strong>Steve Peace</strong></p>
<p>Steve Peace served in state government for more than 25 years. Most recently the Director of Finance for the State of California, Mr. Peace previously served 20 years in the California State Legislature. First elected to the Assembly in 1982, Mr. Peace later served in the Senate from 1993 to 2002.</p>

<p>Throughout his Legislative career, Mr. Peace represented one of the most diverse districts in the State of California. A self-described “radical moderate”, Steve Peace was an aggressive and outspoken advocate of moderation, even at times when such a position was increasingly out of style. Mr. Peace was one of only 3 elected officials to endorse California’s “Open Primary” system. When the Supreme Court overturned the Open Primary, then-Senator Peace introduced legislation that today allows for decline-to-state voters the ability to vote in primary elections.</p>

<p><strong>Ron Roberts</strong></p>
<p>Supervisor Ron Roberts was elected to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors in 1994. He also serves on a number of boards and committees, including the San Diego Workforce Partnership, the Metropolitan Transit System and the City-County reinvestemt Task Force.</p>

<p>Formerly, Supervisor Roberts served as a member of the San Diego City Council and the San Diego Planning Commission. He is an architect by profession and was a managing partner of a large firm prior to his election to the City Council in 1987.</p>

<p>Supervisor Roberts received a Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from San Diego State College and a Master's degree in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
