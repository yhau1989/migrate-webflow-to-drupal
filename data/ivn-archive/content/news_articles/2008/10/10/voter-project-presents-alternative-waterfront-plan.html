<p>A grand plan to redevelop San Diego's waterfront from the airport to Chula
Vista was rolled out today for the press and public by a group called the
California Independent Voter Project. The "alternative waterfront
vision" as it's called, is being promoted by local political heavyweights.
Tonight we'll lay out the grand plan and talk with one of its advocates.</p>

the board of directors for the California Independent Voter Project.</p>
