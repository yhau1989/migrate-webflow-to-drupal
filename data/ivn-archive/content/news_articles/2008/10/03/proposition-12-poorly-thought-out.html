<p>This well-intentioned bill does not go far enough to serve America's veterans who have risked so much for the cause of liberty at home and abroad. Although Prop 12 has raised the number of loans, it still is not enough. This should encompass a wider range of benefits that stretch beyond low-interest loans. <br><br>Another problem with this proposition is that it does not identify discretion as to the size of the loan for different types of veterans. It is reasonable to request that more benefits be offered to those veterans who served in combat zones, to ensure that those who risked more should receive more. <br><br>We must also be weary of the declining housing market, which could make it difficult for these veterans to sell their homes, and they could therefore default on their loans.</p>
