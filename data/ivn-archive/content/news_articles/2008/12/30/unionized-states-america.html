<p>Last week, President-elect Barack Obama <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28298699/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nominated Hilda Solis</a></p>
<p>to the position of Labor Secretary. This marks yet another time when</p>
<p>Obama has turned to the Golden State for guidance in his cabinet, as  Solis is the representative of California's 32<sup>nd</sup> district, and I am sure that those people who elected her to this position must be very proud.</p><p></p><p><br></p>


<p> </p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p>I</p>
<p>am also sure that they must have very bad taste, for this is the second</p>
<p>time that Obama has committed such a colossal blunder</p>
<p>that it has deserved mention on this website. And <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/AerospaceandDefense08/idUSTRE4BE3DC20081215" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything</a> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081121/bs_nm/us_usa_obama" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemed</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/13/hillary-clinton-secretary_n_143735.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">to be</a> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-lahooddec18,0,4429068.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">going</a> <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/12/presidentelect_obama_defends_i.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">so well</a>! Well, except for the <a href="/article/issues/2008/12/17/chu-him-and-spit-him-out" rel="noopener noreferrer">house-painter</a>, but one can't have everything. Solis's nomination has drawn conspicuously <a href="http://www.seiu.org/2008/12/congratulations-labor-secratary-designate-hilda-solis.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">ominous amounts of glee</a> from America's unions and just as conspicuously unpleasant amounts of gloom from <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Worker-Advocate-Solis-Nomination-Slap/story.aspx?guid=%7bAC82CCB2-9A40-4EAE-98C8-F15DB32E93D7%7d" rel="noopener noreferrer">those who have reason</a> not to trust these entities. Their enthusiasm is, sadly, extremely warranted.</p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p> </p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p>There</p>
<p>is no doubt that even a cursory look at Solis's record would reveal</p>
<p>her as an unabashed union shill. Solis's anti-enterprise, pro-union</p>
<p>record is so cemented that the <i><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-solis19-2008dec19,0,2120150.story" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a></i><i>
</i>could actually call her "pro-union" in a headline without breaking the</p>
<p>rules of journalistic objectivity. Not only that, but the <i>Times</i> also</p>
<p>calls Solis "one of the most reliably pro-union voices in the</p>
<p>House" and cites the fact that the AFL-CIO has rated her with a 100 percent</p>
<p>voting score. That means that <i>not once</i> did Solis vote against union interests in the entirety of the last congressional year.</p><p></p><p><br></p>

<p> </p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p>At</p>
<p>any other time, this sort of appointment would not mean much more than</p>
<p>what it looks like: a cynical ploy by a Democrat to cement his</p>
<p>relationship with one of his most reliable voting bases by appointing</p>
<p>one of their most prominent off-the-books advocates to his cabinet.</p>
<p>Given Obama's shaky relationship with working Americans in his own</p>
<p>party during the primaries, this sort of move would seem doubly</p>
<p>important for him politically, though it should be noted that any time</p>
<p>something is done for political reasons, it tends to have an inverse</p>
<p>relationship with the amount of courage the relevant actor <i>should</i> have had. Still, if this were an ordinary term, Obama might have been excused.</p><p></p><p><br></p>

<p> </p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p>But this is <i>not</i></p>
<p>an ordinary term. For one thing, a lot of the less attractive elements</p>
<p>of blind pro-unionism are either coming home to roost or finally</p>
<p>emerging from their coffins, eager to drain our economic life force.</p>
<p>The first reason why increased care for union interests is a bad idea</p>
<p>is that it is one of the elements that makes the Detroit automakers so</p>
<p>impotent that  <i>US News and World Report</i> can sardonically <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/opinion/2008/11/25/no-detroit-bailout.html?s_cid=rss:no-detroit-bailout" rel="noopener noreferrer">note</a></p>
<p>that "Detroit can't compete with Alabama, let alone China." At a time</p>
<p>when this sort of noncompetitiveness is literally killing not only the</p>
<p>economy, but the Federal Budget, more obeisance to labor interests is</p>
<p>hardly appropriate.</p><p></p><p><br></p>

<p> </p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p>But</p>
<p>the much more sinister threat that Solis's nomination poses is that Congress is still sitting on a pro-union bombshell, the</p>
<p>Orwellian "Employee Free Choice Act." One of the primary effects</p>
<p>this act has is arguably to strip employees of the right to a secret</p>
<p>ballot. This means that the door is thrown open for unions to</p>
<p>intimidate, coerce, bribe and otherwise bully workers into signing up.</p>
<p>Setting aside the adverse economic effects of such behavior (higher</p>
<p>inflation, more strikes), this is unacceptable purely from the</p>
<p>perspective of individual rights. Unions may occasionally be a valuable</p>
<p>counterweight to corporate power, but what they need now is a good dose</p>
<p>of antitrust law, not more excuses to dunk scabs' heads in the toilet.</p>
<p>Moreover, the act is so dangerously anti-individual that one leading constitutional scholar has even <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122964977342320545.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> that it is unconstitutional.</p><p></p><p><br></p>
<p></p><p><br></p>
<p>And, of course, Solis <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ON0d_cU_98" rel="noopener noreferrer">supports it</a>.</p>
<p>One would expect nothing else from a woman who spends her time in</p>
<p>Congress shilling for union interests. The</p>
<p>President-elect was on record saying he wouldn't appoint <a href="http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2008/11/11/obama-transition-wont-take-money-from-lobbyists/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lobbyists</a></p>
<p>to his cabinet. And it's true that Solis is not technically a</p>
<p>lobbyist. But as the old saying goes, if it quacks and has webbed feet,</p>
<p>it's a duck, even if you call it a goose. I don't mean to compare</p>
<p>Solis to poultry, but there's no doubt that unfortunately,</p>
<p>Obama has appointed yet another quack.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><br></p>
