and that is why with more than two dozen new legislators sworn in
today, I am wasting no time in calling a fiscal emergency special
session," Schwarzenegger said.</p><p>Unable to reach a compromise on a plan to reduce state spending and raise taxes, the debate will carry on into the session of new legislators who were sworn in this week. </p><p>Legislature Republicans rejected a Democrat-proposed plan to reduce spending by $8.2 billion and raise taxes by $8.2 billion, and instead proposed a stimulus plan that they say will kick-start the economy.</p><p>Under new rules adopted by Proposition 58, the Legislature will not be able to address any other issues if the budget crisis is not solved within 45 days. </p><p>Also today, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the <a href="http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2008/dec/01/recession-120108/?zIndex=17733" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States is officially in a recession. </a></p>
