<p>In an attempt to reach new audiences to get the word out about California's budget deficit, the governor's office has created <a href="http://www.clearspring.com/widgets/49514299f49f1d56/49515ec869791131" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new online widget</a> that marks how many days the Legislature has gone without passing a new budget and displays the amount of money the state is losing by the second. </p><p>
  </p>

<p> </p><p>The governor has even kept an updated <a href="http://twitter.com/schwarzenegger" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a> that posts regularly about the budget deficit and state issues. It's a great way to follow the budget crisis at a glance. </p><p>While you're catching up on how quickly the state budget is draining through on Schwarzenegger's Twitter, don't forget to add CAIVP on <a href="http://twitter.com/caivp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/California-Independent-Voter-Project-CAIVP/32193864434?ref=ts" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>.</p>
