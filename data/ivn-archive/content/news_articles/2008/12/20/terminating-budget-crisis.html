<p>In a move that smells strongly of the old strength and decisiveness
that brought him into office, Governor Schwarzenegger has rejected the
most recent Democratic budget plan as being insufficiently concerned
with cutting the right programs and with raising the right taxes,
according to the <i><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-budget19-2008dec19,0,2571906.story?page=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a></i>.This
rejection comes on the heels of a bit of truly dirty political
maneuvering, in which the Democrats managed to squeeze $9.3 million in
taxes out of California's wallets without so much as consulting a
single GOP assemblyman or senator. <br>
<br>
Schwarzenegger, having just taken
a truly principled stand against one bit of Democratic cynicism, ought
to now take the required steps to bring this flatly anti-representative
bit of tax-and-spend zealotry to heel.<br>
<br>Ironically enough, one Democratic senator characterized his party's
attempt to duck the debate as the reign of "democracy." According to
the <i>Times</i>, Sen. Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) said, "Today, we end the tyranny of the minority. No longer will
we be
captured by ideologues who don't respond to their responsibility."
Funny how that works, since it is precisely the Democratic ideology
(and Schwarzenegger's up-to-this-point nonstop record of appeasement)
that has put California in budget shortfall. Moreover, considering
that the proposed Democratic budget is essentially one giant mishmash
of hypocrisy, Cedillo ought to be advised to look into the mirror
before he cuts himself with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a> again. He has all the wrong
actors in mind for his rant against "ideologues." Considering
that according to Schwarzenegger, Cedillo's pet issue, drivers
licenses for illegal immigrants, would cost the state "<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/sen/sb_0051-0100/sb_60_vt_20051007.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">millions of dollars</a>," Cedillo really ought to be more careful before ranting about the "responsibility" of cutting the budget.<br>
<br>But setting aside the intemperances of a few over-enthusiastic tax
hikers, Schwarzenegger's veto of the Democratic budget constitutes a
very important rejection - the rejection of a confused and often
contradictory argument for a budget in which priorities and incentive
structures could have been stitched together by Victor Frankenstein. In
the proposed budget,  the Democrats
propose to get the necessary process of cutting the budget out of the
way through "cuts to schools and healthcare." Yet, when Schwarzenegger
refused to sign the budget on the grounds that it didn't go far enough
in cutting <i>welfare</i> programs, the Democrats responded that
Schwarzenegger's proposed budget (which is admittedly harsher on
schools) would "ruin the basic functions of California's government and
intensify the state's economic troubles." Very well, but if schools are
such a "basic function," one wonders why the Democrats would include
them in <i>their</i> budget rather than cutting programs like the "state workforce and welfare programs" <i>at all</i>.
Moreover, considering that the Democratic plan would cut school budgets
by $7.3 billion, as opposed to the Republican one that would cut $11
billion, at the point where the difference between the two budgets
isn't even half, the Democrats need to make a more cogent argument for
why those additional $3.7 billion are taking things too far.<br>
<br>None of this should be seen to minimize the impacts of the budget deficit, which is projected to reach the ghastly sum of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-budget11-2008dec11,0,4280427.story" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$41.8 million">$41.8 million</a> 
by 2010. Indeed, something must be done to stop this problem. As such,
Democratic strategist James Kinney was essentially correct when he
stated that when a bus is about to go off a cliff, one should " keep
pumping until the bus stops." However, this is not what the Democrats
are doing. Rather, they are slamming their metaphorical feet at
anything they can reach, whereas Schwarzenegger rightly wants to be
sure that he has his foot on the brakes, rather than the gas.
