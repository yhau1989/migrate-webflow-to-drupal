I am a professor-turned-administrator-turned part-time political pundit. I recently completed my sixth book, "Thatâ€™s Not What They Meant! Reclaiming the Founding Fathers from the American Right," now available from Prometheus Books, and I am now working on my next book, "Arguing As Friends: Why It's Important and Why It's Hard."
