Former IVN editor, currently living in Santiago, Chile, working on data collection, analysis and visualization software in the Start Up Chile accelerator. I have a passion for open discourse, traveling, self-determination, and the power of story telling.  A graduate of UC Berkeley with a degree in Political Economy, I'm also a photographer, music blogger, activist, and pizza enthusiast.
