Being an Independent is sort of like being Neo from The Matrix movies. I grew up and went to school in a town that leaned heavily one way politically, and attended a church that leaned in the opposite direction. I met alot of people and made alot of friends from both worlds, but I never felt too passionate to join either of their sides. When the 2012 election coverage began I watched in amazement as my Facebook and Twitter feeds exploded with the agressive firefight of political warfare. During the debates I could watch one of my friends post a shining decleration of praise for one candidate's masterfull answering of a question, and then watch another friend attack the same candidate for being slimey and evasive. It was all quite comical but it made me think about and appreciate the fact that I wasn't directly tied to either side. Most people think being an Independent is being too lazy to vote in a primary; but in actuallity being an Independant means being able to analyze the people, policies, and practices of government while being "unplugged" from the Matrix of political dogma. The role of the Independants in our viscously competative political system is to champion the causes of compromise and empathy over competition and agression. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a passionate member of a political party, but Independants exist to keep that passion in check less it give way to something more destructive.
