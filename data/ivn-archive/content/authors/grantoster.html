In 2004, I was one of the few at my high school that were of voting age. I did no research on either of the candidates, and the reason I voted for whom I did was ridiculous. I wasn't made aware of the issues, and I didn't bother to look them up. Since then I've made it my mission to offer unbiased guidance for those looking to get the facts of the candidates and their policies.
