Connie Conway was elected on November 4, 2008 to represent the 34th Assembly District, which comprises most of Tulare County, all of Inyo County and parts of Kern and San Bernardino County.  She was re-elected on November 2, 2010.


Recognized for her ability to bring people together, in November 2010 Connie was unanimously elected by her colleagues to serve as Assembly Minority Leader, the top leadership role in the Assembly Republican Caucus.  As Minority Leader, she leads the caucus in forming its legislative agenda and works with her leadership team to advance their political goals.  


Before becoming Minority Leader, Connie served as vice-chair of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee, and as Chair of the bipartisan Legislative Rural Caucus. 


A strong champion of improving CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic climate and bringing back jobs and opportunity to the state, Connie received a 100 percent pro-jobs rating from the California Chamber of Commerce for her votes to keep taxes low and get people working again.
