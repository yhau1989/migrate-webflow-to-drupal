In November 2010, Ceres small-business owner Anthony Cannella was elected to represent the 12th District in the California State Senate.

Anthony currently serves as chairman of the Agriculture Committee and vice chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee. He is also a member of the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee, the Senate Governmental Organization Committee, the Joint Arts Committee and the Joint Rules Committee.
Prior to his election to the Legislature, Anthony served in his hometown of Ceres on the Planning Commission, City Council and two terms as City Mayor. Under his leadership, the City of Ceres repeatedly produced balanced budgets, built financial reserves exceeding 25 percent of its annual budget by cutting costs, and streamlined decision-making to make government more efficient.

While reducing waste, Anthony prioritized funding for public safety programs. On his watch, the Police Division received funding for 21 new police officers and the Fire Division expanded the number of fire houses.

Anthony was raised with an appreciation for public service that he learned from his father, former Assemblyman Sal Cannella. In addition to his duties as mayor, Anthony served as a member of the executive committees on the Stanislaus Economic Development and Workforce Alliance. He is also a past member of the American Red Cross and past executive committee member of the Stanislaus Council of Governments.

A lifelong Central Valley resident, Anthony graduated from the University of California, Davis and began his professional career in a civil engineering firm.

He founded two successful civil engineering businesses. He and his business partners continue to operate Northstar Engineering today. As a business owner, he understands firsthand just how difficult the Legislature has made it to start a business and create jobs.

Anthony and his wife, Julie, have four children.
