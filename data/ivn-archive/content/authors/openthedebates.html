Open the Debates is a nonpartisan and cross-partisan force to open up the political debates of our nation, to all ballot-qualified candidates at every level of government. We are building a national organizing vehicle that can effectively take on the issue of exclusionary debates in all forms, and hope to ultimately topple the duopoly's rigged Commission on Presidential Debates.
