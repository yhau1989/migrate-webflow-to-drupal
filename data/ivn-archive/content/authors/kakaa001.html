Born, raised, and educated in Maryland, but now pursuing a law degree at the University of San Diego, Kaylan has experienced firsthand the vast differences between rural, country life and exciting city life.  She seeks to find some middle ground between the two.  In her spare time, she enjoys running and volunteering at humane societies.
