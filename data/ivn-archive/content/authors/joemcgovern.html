Joe is a progressive liberal democrat who has always been interested in politics, but who recently grew tired of the extreme political partisanship in America today. He created The Other Side: a liberal democrat explores conservative America to see if he could find another way – a better way – to talk to those he disagrees with. 20,000 miles, 5 months, 35 states and 82 interviews later, Joe and his team are editing the footage of his journey into a 75 minute documentary they hope will bring the two sides together and create a more efficient way to do politics and government in America.
