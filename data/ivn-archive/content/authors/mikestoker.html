I have always supported the Open Primary system both at the ballot box and in public speaking engagements and written op-eds in the local newspapers. I strongly believe that an Open Primary over a couple of election cycles will lead to more mainstream Republicans, Democrats and Declined to States getting elected who will be more pro-business, pro-pension reform and pro-budget reform which will be a huge advantage to moving California forward and breaking the current grid lock creating a dysfunctional state government.

I am also the only candidate supporting Democrat Governor Jerry Brown's Pension Reform proposal. My two Democrat opponents are opposed. I look forward to working in a bi-partisan way with the Governor to pass Pension Reform. I am the only candidate focusing on Budget Reform and Regulatory Reform to help make California more business friendly. My opponents want to spend their time talking about "special interests" and "campaign contributions." So much is at stake for California in this election. I think all voters, but especially those that have chosen "No Party Preference" or are undecided want a real discussion of the real issues and offering up some real solutions to move California forward. I have done just that since the day I announced my candidacy and will continue talking about the issues the voters care about until Election Day.
