Stephen Erickson is the author of "What Would Madison Do? The Political Journey Progressives and Conservatives Must Make Together," probably the only political book in America today praised by leading voices on the Left AND Right. Beginning as Resident Scholar at US Term Limits in the 1990s, he has worked for years on political reform.

Trained as an historian, Erickson is also co-author of the critically acclaimed history book, "Boon Island: A True Story of Mutiny, Shipwreck and Cannibalism."
