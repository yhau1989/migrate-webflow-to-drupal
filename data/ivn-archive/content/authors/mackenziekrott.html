A political science and public relations double major at Temple University, Mackenzie is politically moderate, but leans to the right on economic issues.  She interned this past fall with the Committee of Seventy, a non-partisan, non-profit political group in Philadelphia that advocates for transparent government, fair elections and an honest political culture. She's interested in seeing how the Republican party evolves over the next four years, and hopes to see a moderate candidate on the ballot in 2016. She studied abroad in Rome last year, where she completely fell in love with Italy and travel.
