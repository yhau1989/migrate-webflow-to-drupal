Conor Murphy graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a political science degree. While he was still in school, Conor hosted two popular radio shows on WVCW called “Murphy’s Law” and “Son of the Revolution”. Conor is no longer fooled by propaganda or the two-party system. Although registered as an Independent, Conor would describe himself as a libertarian and a recovering neo-con.
