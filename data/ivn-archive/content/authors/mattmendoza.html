I am a man of roots.  I believe in family, friends, and community.  Like all of you I have my own story:  small town boy, big dreams and strong ties to what really matters in life. 

Born and raised in Lemon Grove, California I attended Monterey Heights Elementary and Palm Junior High School.  Mount Miguel High School in Spring Valley was my next stop; and after graduating in 1976, I headed off to Southwestern College in Chula Vista.

As with most people, I learned what I needed to in school, and then some.  Football, basketball and track taught me the value of teamwork, but what I did not expect to learn was the value of mentorship. 

Investing in people, whether as a recipient or giver, is one of the greatest cycles of hope we can participate in. Coaching both the girls and boys basketball teams at Mount Miguel (1977-78 &amp; 1982-83 respectively) provided an avenue for me to give back to my community and encourage the next generation.  Little did I know then how that would transfer to a greater vision for our own state of California.

My career at General Dynamics in San Diego included 16 years at the Linbergh Field plant where I moved up the ladder through hard work and commitment.  From commercial aircraft to proto type special projects for the military, missiles and space systems to my managerial experience at Boeing Satellite Systems for the past 15 years: my experience is now your experience as I pour and utilize all that I have learned back into you as your state representative.

The traditional family values I hold strong are founded on my faith in God, and my parents own example of 62 years of marriage.  My wife, Candette, and I hold to these same family values and are committed to live out such an example as my own mom and dad.  We attend church at Vista Christian Fellowship in Vista, California and are blessed by our church family.  My faith in God is my strength, guidance and moral compass.

As all small town boys do, I grew up.  The years have brought experiences I never imagined, both joys and sorrows, but the essence of
Matthew James Mendoza has not changed.  Commitment, leadership, courage, strength, and character are all qualities we glean from our foundational core; all of which are intertwined with all of you, my community.
