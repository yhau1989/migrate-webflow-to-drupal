I am currently an economics major at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. I am President of the Young Americans for Liberty chapter here in Auburn. We are a political activism group that is mainly targeted at youths who are "traditionally conservative and classically liberal". I began to be politically active rather young. I was about 15 when I began to actively sign petitions. I was a democrat, but in 2007 I heard of the Ron Paul movement, the libertarian movement, and I began to learn about Austrian Economic Theory. Once I learned more of economic theories I changed to a Voluntarist Libertarian.
