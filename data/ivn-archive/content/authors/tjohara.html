T.J. O'Hara is an internationally recognized author, speaker, strategic consultant in the private and public sectors, who also serves as the Principal Political Analyst for IVN.

Along the way, he earned the first Presidential endorsement of the Whig Party since the 1850s, his website was archived by the Library of Congress for its historic significance, and he won the first on-line “virtual” Presidential election (conducted by We Want You) by a commanding 72.1% and 72.7% over Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, respectively. He is the author of a satirical political trilogy ("The Left isn't Right" - "The Right is Wrong" - and "The National Platform of Common Sense") and has written recurring columns for The Washington Times and Communities Digital News that explore our Nation’s most pressing issues, challenge conventional thinking, and provide an open forum for civil discussion.
