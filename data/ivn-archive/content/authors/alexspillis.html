Alex Spillis is a political consultant and lobbyist at Floridian Partnerâ€™s Miami office. With a degree in Economics and Entrepreneurship, Alex seeks to inform others on how our policy choices of today can impact the world of tomorrow. Alex became interested in working with Independent political candidates when he, a registered Republican, found himself at odds with the overreaching policy proposals brought forth by both major political parties. As such, Alex created We Are Generation Why with the intent of educating the public on the alternatives to the traditional, stale ideas recycled each election cycle by Republicans and Democrats.
