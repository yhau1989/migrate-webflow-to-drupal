Richard lives in Sacramento, California, and hosts "Speaking in Tongues" on KDVS 90.3 FM, a Friday afternoon public affairs program that emphasizes liberal to left issues of concern from an anti-authoritarian perspective.  Through his life in Sacramento, recognized as one of the most diverse cities in the United States, he has come to appreciate the centrality of racial and class diversity in any progressive social movement.  He has also posted on the American Leftist blog, http://www.amleft.blogspot.com, since 2005. He believes that the hierarchies embedded within American capitalism are responsible for the deprivation and violence that are so endemic in this society, and insists that he was radicalized more by Oshima and Fassbinder than by Marx, Trotsky and Kropotkin.
