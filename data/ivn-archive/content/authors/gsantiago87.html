Genevieve is a recent UC Berkeley graduate, having earned her BA in political science. She is also a self-proclaimed 'political junkie' and can often be found fawning over DemocracyNow.org or other unbiased, straight-shooting political news sites.  While at Cal, she strived to be politically well-rounded taking courses in the U.S. Presidency, Congress, Latinos in U.S. politics, urban and metropolitan politics, the "welfare states," war, political psychology, political theory, and California politics. She went through college with the reminder that we cannot change anything unless we understand it, and is making an earnest effort to do just that. 
Genevieve wants to contribute to IVN because she values news sources that do not pander strictly to the left or right. As time has progressed, our two leading political parties have only become more divided on critical issues, and Americans are presented with less "fair" media. This has resulted in a greater number of independent voters, and more Americans who do not wish to be affiliated with Democrats or Republicans. Genevieve included. When she is not soaking up all that is newsworthy, she enjoys spending time with her family. She comes from a large, close-knit Spanish, Mexican, and Puerto Rican family.  
Genevieve also enjoys outdoor activities. Hiking, yoga, running, or riding bikes to the local marina are some of her favorite activities.
