Emmily is an award-winning journalist, having received the Nevada Press Association’s Outstanding Journalist of the Year award in 2005, as well as recognition for news and feature stories. She has been praised for her work as a community organizer and was nominated for a Margaret Sanger award in 2012. A survivor of sexual abuse, Emmily has worked to be a voice for other survivors through her blogs, The Sin City Siren and The Tired Feminist, as well as through lobbying and activist work. She is a fierce advocate for women’s rights, including serving as the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against a personhood initiative in Nevada in 2009/10. Her activism began when she was a student at the University of Oregon, where she graduated with a degree in English and minors in journalism and women’s studies. Her blog The Sin City Siren was nationally syndicated in 2011, which is the same year she joined the feminist blogging consortium Fem2pt0, based in Washington, DC. Emmily lives in Las Vegas with her husband and daughter. She tweets from @TheSinCitySiren.
