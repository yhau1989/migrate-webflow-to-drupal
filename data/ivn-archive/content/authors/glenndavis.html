My hope is that bipartisan and nonpartisan solutions will become the new ideal in American politics. I founded The C-Plan in 2013, a movement to help overcome partisan divisiveness: "C" for Civility, Cooperation, Collaboration, Compassion, Consensus &amp; Compromise.  Join me at http://www.TheCPlan.org/join. When not writing or advocating the cause, I am a quantitative researcher and own a survey management firm, DataStar, Inc., in Waltham, MA.
