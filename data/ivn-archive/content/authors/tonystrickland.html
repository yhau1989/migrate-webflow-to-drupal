Tony is the youngest of 3 children. His mother, Antonie, emigrated to the United States from Germany and became a U.S. Citizen in 1971. His father, Don, was a career military soldier. They taught him the same values he hopes to impart to his children and that he strives to bring to public officeÃ¢â‚¬â€honesty, integrity, and hard work. TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core philosophy that he brings to government is his belief in personal responsibility and creating an efficient, responsible government with low taxes that does not do for its citizenry that which they can do for themselves.

At home, Tony is a husband of 13 years to his wife, Audra, and a father to two childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€Ruby Ruth and Anthony Paul.

As a member of the California State Senate, Senator StricklandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top priority is growing CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy. He believes the best way to preserve funding for vital programs like healthcare, education, and transportation is by creating jobs. He is committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to craft fundamental reforms to CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s budget process that has brought an unacceptable crisis to the state.

Prior to joining the Senate, Tony served in the California State Assembly for the maximum six years from 1998-2004. In the Assembly, Tony quickly established a reputation as a taxpayer advocate and a representative with the skills to reach independent solutions to make government more accountable. He championed policies to help the economy. He received an Ã¢â‚¬Å“AÃ¢â‚¬Â grade from the Chamber of Commerce for legislation he authored and votes he cast to help create better, higher-paying jobs.

As a long time advocate for working California families, it was in the State Assembly that Strickland took the action he is perhaps best known for. He filed a law suit against then-Governor Gray Davis on behalf of energy rate-payers, which ultimately forced the Davis Administration to reveal outrageously expensive energy contracts it had negotiated in secret between the State of California and energy companies.

An active member of his community, Tony has been a Board Member of the Ventura County Council Boy Scouts of America, an Advisory Committee Member of Food Share, and an Honorary Board Member of the Moorpark Boys &amp; Girls Club, in addition to being active in numerous civic, business and church organizations throughout Ventura County. Tony currently serves as a Member of the Board of Directors for SurePath Financial Solutions.

In 2002, he was the recipient of the San Fernando Valley Business &amp; Professional AssociationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Free Enterprise Award, for championing economic policies that help create opportunities for working families, and was awarded the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forty under 40Ã¢â‚¬Â Award from the Pacific Coast Business Times.

Tony received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Whittier College. In 1992, Whittier College recognized TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s achievements by bestowing him with its Leadership and Service Award.

California State Senate District 19 includes portions of Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles Counties.
