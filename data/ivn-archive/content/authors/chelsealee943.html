Chelsea is a current social media intern at IVN.  She is working towards a BA in Sociology and African American studies at Brandeis University.  As student manager at her on-campus job in the student store, she became very interested in the importance of marketing and social media to increase the awareness of products available to her peers.  Her role as a social media intern is to learn how to facilitate conversations, help update you on what is going on with IVN, and discuss the growing importance of social media in politics.
