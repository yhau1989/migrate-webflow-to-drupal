As Ralph NaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national ballot access coordinator in 2008, I helped gather over 500,000 signatures to ensure that voters had a choice in who they cast their vote for. I've secured ballot lines for numerous independent candidates and alternative political parties including the Constitution, Democrat, Green, Libertarian, Republican and Socialist Equality parties.Check out www.FreeandEqual.org I love what I do for a living. Free and Equal will challenge these laws, through lobbying of state legislators, court challenges, and initiatives.
