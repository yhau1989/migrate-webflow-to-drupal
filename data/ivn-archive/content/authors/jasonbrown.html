Jason has been working in law enforcement since 2006. This has allowed him to wear quite a few different hats in the criminal justice field. He has also been a member of the Political Science Department at Columbus State University, where he helped teach and perform research in the realm of Poly-Sci. Today, Jason continues to invest in this field by writing and reporting on today's most provocative political issues and events.
