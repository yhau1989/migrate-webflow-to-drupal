George Plescia represents a new generation of leaders who aren't afraid of words like bi-partisan or compromise.  Respected for his ability to reach across the aisle to build consensus on some of California's larger issues of the day, there is little wonder why George's candidacy for State Senate has shaken things up.

Recognizing his ability to work with all parties, former San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy selected George and nine other community leaders to serve on the Sorrento Valley Traffic Subcommittee.  Tasked with expediting a new route through San Diego's growing technology corridor, George worked with multiple coalitions to open the Vista Sorrento Parkway to expand our local economy.

Chosen by his neighbors to be their voice in Sacramento, George continued to broaden his policy work to address the quality-of-life issues that affect every San Diegan.  From ensuring the tax we pay at the gas pump is dedicated to roads and bridges, to passing the Healthcare Fraud Protection Act, it's clear George Plescia thinks independently.

Elected by his peers as Assembly Republican Leader, George helped negotiate landmark, and subsequently voter approved, legislation to repair and widen the I-5, I-805, I-15 and Highway 56, as well as rebuild our schools and put people back to work.  George proved California could be governed in a bi-partisan manner by negotiating what was then the first on-time state budget passed in years.

Highlights of George's legislative work include an historic agreement between Southern California water agencies, expanding Megan's Law protections, and ensuring our gas taxes are dedicated to their intended purpose of keeping our local roads and bridges in repair and our economy growing.

George's experience serving on the Assembly Budget, Health, Government Organization and Water, Parks and Wildlife committees helped him achieve a record of bi-partisan accomplishments.  For his achievements, George's record was recognized by the Building Owners and Managers Association who named him San Diego Public Official of the Year; BIOCOM named him Legislator of the Year and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce awarded him their Advocate for Business Award.
