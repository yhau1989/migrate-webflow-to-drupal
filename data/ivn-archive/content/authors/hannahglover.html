I am a high school student who is passionate about politics and truth. While this passion is paradoxical, it really shouldn't be. Politics and truth should be complimentary, not contradictory. I am working towards that goal and others as a journalism intern for IVN, a San Diego Chapter Board Member of IVP, a journalism intern for The Prospect, a freelance writer, and Editor in Chief of my school newspaper.
