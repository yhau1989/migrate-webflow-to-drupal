I am a retired business executive turned consultant and executive coach. Also a first generation immigrant from the Netherlands.
My passion is writing and I maintain a blog CASTNET COMMENTARY castnetcorp.blogspot.com.
Am a first time author of the book NEITHER HERE NOR THERE, A First Generation Immigrant in Search of American Exceptionalism in which I address the perceived flaws in the American political system, including the two party system.
