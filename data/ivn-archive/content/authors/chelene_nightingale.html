A homeschooling mother, Chelene Nightingale has been a leading Constitutional activist organizing political rallies and marches in California, including the "Free the Texas Three" march for Deputy Gilmer Hernandez and Border Patrol agents, Ramos &amp; Compean in Hollywood.  The march was featured on the nationally syndicated show "America's Most Wanted".  

In addition to organizing political events, Chelene has lobbied as a private citizen in Sacramento and Washington DC, demanding secure borders and no amnesty.  Besides the border security issue, Ms. Nightingale has attended and spoken at Tea Party rallies and End the Fed events.  

Back in 2006, Chelene served as the campaign manager for Third Party gubernatorial candidate, Art Olivier.  During the last presidential cycle, she met and endorsed Republican Congressman, Dr. Ron Paul.  And now, due to her political achievements, the National Constitution Party has asked her to run for California governor as an American Independent.

The daughter of a military war veteran, Chelene is attempting to restore a state that has been hurt by big government and special interest groups.  Ms. Nightingale has been listed on the "Who's Who" list, managed a former 501c3, served as Vice President of a distribution/production company, and operated a small business.
