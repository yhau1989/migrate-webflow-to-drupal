The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting (RCV Maine) ran the campaign to make Maine the first state to adopt ranked choice voting for state and federal elections. Ranked Choice Voting was approved by a majority of voters in 2016. RCV Maine is currently fighting to make sure lawmakers give the people the voting reform they asked for.
