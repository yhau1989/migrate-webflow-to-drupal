Mr. Peace served 20 years in the California State Legislature, having been first elected to the Assembly in 1982, and later served in the State Senate from 1993 to 2002. Throughout his Legislative career, Mr. Peace represented one of the most diverse districts in the State of California.  A self-described "radical moderate", Steve Peace was an aggressive and outspoken advocate of moderation, even at times when such a position was increasingly out of style.  

Mr. Peace was one of only three elected officials to endorse California's non-partisan Open Primary system.  When the Supreme Court overturned the Open Primary, then-Senator Peace introduced legislation that today allows decline-to-state voters the ability to vote in primary elections.
