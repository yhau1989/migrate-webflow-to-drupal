My outlook on life is simplistic and optimistic: Learn as much as possible (about everything), love as much as possible, follow the Golden Rule, and use everyday as an opportunity to better myself and the world around me. Deepak Chopra says that true happiness is "divine discontent," fulfilled by our creative impulse. I believe that creating is the most important thing we can do. Art, music, writing...So I'm using every opportunity at my disposal to create change and leave this world a better place than I found it.
