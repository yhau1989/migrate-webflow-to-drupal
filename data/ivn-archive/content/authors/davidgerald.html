After serving 7 years in the US Navy he used his GI Bill to get a BA in Political Science from San Jose State and a Juris Doctorate law degree from Depaul College of Law in Chicago. He can be described as a libertarian-minded political skeptic who wants to make the system prove itself or find other alternatives that can do it better. Views every issue through a lens of  "what is the best solution that allows the maximum amount of personal freedom." Age 32.
