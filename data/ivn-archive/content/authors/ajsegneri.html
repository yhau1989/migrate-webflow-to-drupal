For 15 years I have worked as an activist, political campaigner, and social entrepreneur. During that time I have helped organize in the areas of social justice, economic rights, education, and the environment. 

Along with my work, I have spoken at one day workshops, conferences, and conventions to speak on issues and to train those to improve their skill set. 

Outside of my work I have taught in academia in the fields of cultural studies, political philosophy, and sociology.
