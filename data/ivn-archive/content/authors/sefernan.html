I have a BS in Biochemistry from UCSD and recently completed a biofuels scientific technician certificate program at UCSD's Extension.  My goals are to utilize my background in biochemistry to create and promote more sustainable systems and practices within communities.  I would like to contribute to the preservation of local ecological systems with a focus on marine environments.
