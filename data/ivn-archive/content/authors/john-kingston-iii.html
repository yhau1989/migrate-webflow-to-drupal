In 2016, Mr. Kingston launched the non-partisan initiative Better For America, a presidential ballot access program to ensure a pathway for an independent candidate to run for President of the United States in 2016. It seeks to attract an independent candidate who demonstrates honor, lives with integrity, will unite a divided America, and seeks the good of all citizens.
