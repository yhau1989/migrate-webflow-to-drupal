A Georgia native, and recent transplant to Charleston, SC, Drew first took an interest in politics after being inspired by the Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign. After much study he became convinced the only logical and morally acceptable society is one in which individual liberty is protected and devoid of any state intervention. Heavily influenced by the politics of Frederic Bastiat, Albert Jay Nock, Thomas Jefferson, Barry Goldwater and contemporary writers such as Ron Paul, Bill Kauffman and Jeffrey Tucker; Drewâ€™s worldview is a blend of traditional conservatism and classical liberalism.
