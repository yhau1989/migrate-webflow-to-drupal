Take Back Our Republic believes that individual participation in the American political system is the best way to preserve and strengthen our liberty. 

We engage in research, education, and advocacy about returning political power to individuals and ending the system of escalating campaign contributions by corporations, labor unions and special interests that fuels government spending.
