I Graduated from college with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science. I avidly read and analyze material on all matters related to the social sciences (political science, history, economics, child development, psychology, and family therapy) and have been known to dabble in some of the hard sciences (physics and math). Call me a nerd, but nerd is the new awesome!!
