James L. Butler has been writing novels for over twenty years, mostly science fiction for adult readers at first but now creating Children's books. His most recent, The Cow-Pie Chronicles, is closely based on Jim's childhood growing up on a small family dairy farm in the mid-west with his younger sister.
