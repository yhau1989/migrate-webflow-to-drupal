A fiscal conservative, small business owner, and staunch opponent of high taxation and government waste, Dan Logue has worked tirelessly to bring his belief in limited government and free enterprise to Sacramento. 

In the Assembly, he serves in the leadership role of Chief Whip for the Republican Caucus and is responsible for coordinating voting and managing messaging for the Republican Caucus. He is the Vice-Chair of the influential Assembly Health Committee and the Elections and Redistricting Committee. He is also a member of the Assembly Budget Committee, as well as the Budget Sub Committee 4, which oversees the administration of State agencies and operations, and he sits on the critical Assembly Transportation Committee. 

Assemblyman Logue was appointed chair of the Caucus Task Force on Jobs and Economic Recovery, and in this role, Logue has applied his extensive experience in economic development, leading Republican efforts to improve California's business climate, fighting for jobs retention, reducing regulatory burdens, and working towards economic recovery for the Golden State. 

Consistent with his efforts to revitalize the economy and keep jobs and businesses in California, Logue has organized the Economic Recovery Group, which meets regularly with business representatives from all sectors of California's economy to discuss ways to eliminate impediments and restrictive government regulations in order to improve our state's business climate. He has conducted public hearings up and down the state to listen to the concerns of business owners. He held the first out-of-state hearing when he took fellow legislators to Reno, Nevada, to hear firsthand from businesses their reasons for leaving California. 

The National Federation of Independent Business has awarded Logue a perfect score based on his voting record and support of small business. His widespread efforts have also drawn the attention of media outlets across the nation, including the New York Times, FOX News, and the Los Angeles Times. 

Prior to serving in the California State Assembly, Logue served on the Yuba County Board of Supervisors. While serving as a Member of the Board of Supervisors, Logue worked to bring new businesses and manufacturers to the North State, growing the economy and creating jobs. Logue also worked to change the culture of local government to make it more responsive and business friendly. As a result of his efforts, Dan was voted the best political leader in the region by readers of the Appeal Democrat. 

Inspired by the experiences of his father, who served in World War II, and the dedicated service of local veterans, Dan led the charge to organize a local veterans Memorial Committee that raised over $350,000 in private funds to construct two world class Veterans Memorials in the Yuba-Sutter area. 

Dan and his wife, Peggy, reside in Linda with their dog, Buddy.
