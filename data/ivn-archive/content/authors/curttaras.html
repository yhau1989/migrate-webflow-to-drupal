As your Congressman, I will create a strong and sustainable economy by building infrastructure for the Sacramento Region. I will erect bridges to reduce our commutes, strengthen levees to defend our homes from flooding, and wire an energy grid to power our machines with clean and affordable electricity. We have the workforce, location, and climate to become a thriving economy. With your vote, I offer it my leadership.
With the war ending we have the opportunity to restructure the federal budget to be fiscally responsible. In Congress I will insure our limited tax dollars create a business-friendly California by removing roadblocks that prevent job creation and economic stability for this District.
In Elk Grove, I will create the Grant Line Highway Connector between CA99 and US50 to save 20 minutes off a trip to Tahoe.

In Rancho Cordova, I will enhance Mather Airfield as an air-cargo hub to attract distribution businesses and jobs.

For Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights, and Carmichael I will fund a new bridge over the American River between Watt and Sunrise to reduce commutes.
For Sacramento County, I will enhance Folsom Lake Dam operations to produce more electricity, water supply, recreation, and flood control benefits.
