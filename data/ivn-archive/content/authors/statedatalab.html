The mission of Truth in Accounting™ (TIA™) is, in a non-partisan manner, to compel governments to produce financial reports that are understandable, reliable, transparent and correct.  We believe truthful accounting is the key for citizens, legislators and the press to clearly understand the truth about government debt and to enable informed proposals for its resolution.
