Bob has been blogging since 2003 at Politics in the Zeros on progressive politics, populism the economy, renewable energy, and cleantech. 

He helped organize numerous antiwar protests from 2004-2007, some of which were massive. He was Co-coordinator of the Green Party of Los Angeles County Council from 2002-2004. 

His politics tend towards left-wing populism and is especially interested in issues that transcend party lines and bring people together.  He and his wife live in Silicon Valley.
