The Breakthrough Institute is a paradigm-shifting think tank committed to modernizing liberal thought for the 21st Century. Our core values are integrity, imagination and audacity. Our goal is to accelerate the transition to a future where all the world's inhabitants can enjoy secure, free, prosperous, and fulfilling lives on an ecologically vibrant planet. 

Breakthrough Institute was founded in 2003 to modernize liberal-progressive-green politics. Intellectual renewal must precede political renewal and so our focus is on overarching conceptual paradigms and not just specific policies. Thus our day-to-day work includes policy, technological, and economic analyses as well as long-form essays placing these analyses in the larger context of modernization. Breakthrough is best known for its work on energy and climate, though in 2009 it expanded its reach to include national security and counter-terrorism policy.
