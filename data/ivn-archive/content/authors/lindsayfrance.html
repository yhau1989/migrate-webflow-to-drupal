Lindsay France covers the Whitehouse and business news for the Independent Voter Network. She is also the host of the podcast “The Business of Politics”. 
Previously she spent several years reporting on American politics and working as a foreign correspondent covering Eurozone austerity measures, Brexit, and developing economies. Based in Washington, she now spends her time writing and talking about fixing our electoral laws and overall political system, while avoiding obnoxious on-air arguments that make news executives lots of money and volunteering with the ASPCA’s FIR rescue team.
