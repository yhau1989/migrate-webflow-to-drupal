Taylor is currently studying Political Science at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC. Although he has gained much knowledge concerning politics from within academic walls, he has also experienced politics outside them as well from opportunities such as interning with the Mayor of Columbia's office and with a political consulting firm. He focuses much of his time on comparing contemporary situations with historical examples, budgetary policy, and foreign aid.
