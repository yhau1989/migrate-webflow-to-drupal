A highly successful entrepreneur, Steve Poizner founded two successful technology companies in Silicon Valley. His last company, SnapTrack, pioneered the technology that put life-saving GPS receivers into 700 million cell phones around the world.

In 2006, Steve became one of only two Republicans elected statewide when he defeated Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante in the race for Insurance Commissioner. As Insurance Commissioner, Steve oversees the California Department of Insurance (CDI), the largest consumer protection agency in the state. Since assuming office, Steve has permanently cut the operating budget at the Department of Insurance by 15% - making him the only candidate running for Governor who has actually cut waste from state government.

Steve also spent a year "in the trenches" as a volunteer teacher at Mount Pleasant High School in East San Jose, where he taught 12th grade American government. After seeing the crisis conditions facing public schools in California, Steve demonstrated his passion for local control of schools by co-founding EdVoice and the California Charter Schools Association - the state's leading charter school organization. Since his involvement in the charter school movement began, the number of charter schools in California has doubled.
