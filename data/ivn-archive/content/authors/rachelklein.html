Rachel Klein is a college junior, majoring in special education and English at Radford University. She became a journalist mostly by accident, earning the opinion manager job at Whim (RU's online magazine) because of her high-school debate experience. Following her spring 2013 semester studying English literature at the University of Glasgow, she is returning to Whim as the managing editor and making her debut as an IVN contributor.
