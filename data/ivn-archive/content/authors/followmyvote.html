Follow My Vote is a nonpartisan organization born on the 4th of July in 2012, founded on the principles of freedom, as a tribute to the Founding Fathers of the United States.

As a first step towards fulfilling our mission, Follow My Vote is taking on the challenge of improving the integrity standards of voting systems used in elections worldwide.
