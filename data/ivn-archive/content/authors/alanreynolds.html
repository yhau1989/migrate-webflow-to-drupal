I am an “Independent” Candidate for CA Lt. Governor, a volunteer City Commissioner, Engineer, and small businessman who was born and raised in California. I attended public schools in CA and went to USC for Aerospace Engineering and spent time as an Environmental Project manager, assisting engineering projects/environmental studies at the Port of Los Angeles and Huntington Beach.
 
I worked as an Engineering Consultant and Technical Sales specialist before starting my own business, Reynolds Sales and Consulting. I have been a member of the Modern Whig Party, a follower of the Reform Party and a fan of the Centrist Project for some time. www.alansreynolds.com
