The California Manufacturers &amp; Technology Association (formerly the California Manufacturers Association) works to improve and enhance a strong business climate for California's 30,000 manufacturing, processing and technology based companies. Since 1918, CMTA has worked with state government to develop balanced laws, effective regulations and sound public policies to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs while safeguarding the state's environmental resources. CMTA represents 700 businesses from the entire manufacturing community -- an economic sector that generates more than $200 billion every year and employs more than 2 million Californians.
