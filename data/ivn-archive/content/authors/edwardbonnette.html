Florida Boy who escaped to the West Coast! I graduated from Florida State University (Go Noles), with a B.S. in Economics and a B.S. in Marketing. I am currently a 2L at the University of San Diego School of Law and hope to practice in the business law field. Politically I feel I lean left socially and middle/slightly right fiscally.
