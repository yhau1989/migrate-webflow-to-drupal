On January 25, 2013, Evan Falchuk and a group of determined Massachusetts residents launched the United Independent Party, committed to pragmatically progressive ideas and fiscally sensible solutions.

Like many people in his home state, he was tired of outdated political arguments and too many leaders putting loyalty to party line before offering real, pragmatic solutions. He understood the growing desire for a sensible political alternative, one that could meet votersâ€™ growing demand for common-sense ideas and pragmatic solutions.

A married, 43-year-old father of three, Falchuk is highly regarded for his expertise in legislative policy, health care reform and business leadership. His perspective has been featured in outlets ranging from the Wall Street Journal, CNN and The Boston Globe to Forbes, USA Today, and CBS Radio. An avid Red Sox fan, he credits the team with permanently changing his life on October 27, 2004.
