Cory Franklin was Director of Medical Intensive Care at Cook County (Illinois) Hospital for 25 years. Before retiring, he wrote over 80 medical articles, chapters, abstracts, and correspondences in books and professional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and the Hastings Center Report. In 1999, he was awarded the Shubin-Weil Award by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, one of only forty people ever honored as a national role model for the practice and teaching of intensive care medicine. In 1993, he worked as a technical advisor to Harrison Ford and was one of the role models for the physician character Ford played in the film, The Fugitive.

Since retirement, besides medical teaching and doing charity medical work, Dr. Franklin has been a frequent freelance contributor to the Chicago Tribune op-ed page. His pieces, serious and occasionally satirical, range from medical issues to history, culture, the arts, sports, and human interest. His work has been published in the New York Times, the New York Post, the Washington Post, and The Chicago Sun-Times as well as being excerpted in the New York Review of Books. The Atlantic Wire has selected his piece on CT scanning as one of its Five Best Thursday columns. His freelance work has also appeared internationally in The Guardian and The Jerusalem Post. He is also the host of a weekly audio podcast, Remembering the passed, which discusses the role of notable people who have died recently on our history, society, or culture. His book Chicago Flashbulbs: A Quarter Century of News, Politics, Sports, and Show Business (1987-2012) was recently published by Academy Chicago Publishing.
