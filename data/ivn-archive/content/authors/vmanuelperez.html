First elected in 2008 and now in his second term, State Assemblymember V. Manuel PÃƒÂ©rez represents the 80th Assembly District, comprised of eastern Riverside and Imperial counties.  As chair of the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economic Development, and the Economy, the AssemblymanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top legislative priority is economic recovery, which he believes can be achieved by supporting local economic development activities, investing in education, and ensuring a safety net for our most vulnerable.  Assemblyman PÃƒÂ©rez is also a member of the Assembly Committees on Aging and Long-term Care; Government Organization; Health; and Veterans Affairs.  

Included among the AssemblymanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many legislative accomplishments are: the reinstatement of the Small Business Loan Guarantee program; securing $2.3 billion in clean tech economic recovery bonds to help local governments attract business and create jobs; expediting the state permitting process for renewable energy projects in the desert region; ensuring fair access to the Safe Routes to School program to help promote more walkable and pedestrian friendly communities; granting the Cal Vet home loan program the authority to provide refinancing services to eligible veterans to help them avoid foreclosure; and protecting the Enterprise Zone program from elimination during recent budget negotiations.

The Assemblyman is a lifelong resident of the 80th Assembly District. Born in Indio and raised in Coachella, he grew up in a close-knit family that taught him the value of hard work, determination, respect, and service to others.  He attended public schools, graduated from U.C. Riverside, and earned a MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree in Education from Harvard University. He has served as a school teacher, a youth advocate, and a community healthcare director. Before being elected to the Assembly, he served on the board of the Coachella Valley Unified School District.
