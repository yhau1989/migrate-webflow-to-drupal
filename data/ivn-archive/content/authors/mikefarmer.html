I'm a small business owner interested in politics. My politics lean libertarian/classical liberal, and my economic understanding leans toward the Austrians, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Thomas Woods, Jr. I've recently been encouraged by the New Republicans, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Justin Amash and Ted Cruz, but basically I'm non-partisan, concerned with limiting government power and enhancing private sector power.
