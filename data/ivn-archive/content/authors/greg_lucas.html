Greg Lucas has been a California political writer and satirist for more than 20 years. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leveled his bipartisan wit and humor at both Republicans and Democrats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and, not infrequently, himself. 

Now a freelance writer, he still covers state government shenanigans at CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capitol, www.californiascapitol.com, an often funny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ usually intentionally -- and occasionally insightful blog on California politics.

Greg has spoken to educators, business leaders and numerous trade associations about the good, bad and ugly of California politics. He has also counseled companies on improving their writing and communications. There is plenty of room for improvement. 

During 19 years covering the state Capitol for the San Francisco Chronicle, Greg wrote nearly 3,000 articles on everything from presidential politics to the introduction of prune burgers in school cafeterias. 

Greg has written about gambling, transportation, health care, growth, education and nearly every DBI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dull But Important Ã¢â‚¬â€œ issue that has confronted public policy makers over the past two decades. His most challenging job, however, was ride operator on Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland.

He has a BachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree in Communications from Stanford University and a Masters degree in Professional Writing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as opposed to amateurish writing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the University of Southern California. But he has never let academics stand in the way of his education.
