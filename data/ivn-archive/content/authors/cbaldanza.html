Chiara recently graduated from UCLA, where she studied politics and developing economies. Raised in a small Conservative pocket of California by two hippie parents, Chiara was exposed to views from both ends of the political spectrum from a young age. She wound up somewhere in the middle politically, but is more concerned with intellectual discussion than political affiliation. She believes that it is our duty as citizens to remain informed of the facts.
