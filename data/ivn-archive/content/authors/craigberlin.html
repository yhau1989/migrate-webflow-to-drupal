In our polarized and partisan political landscape my views are hard to categorize. I most closely resemble a libertarian-leaning independent combining classical liberalism with a shot of pragmatism. After graduating from the University of Texas with degrees in Radio-TV-Film and Plan II, the Liberal Arts Honors Program, I began my career in broadcast news and proceeded to run multiple small businesses. Youâ€™ll find an archive of articles here, and on Medium and Wordpress.  I also answer questions on Quora.
