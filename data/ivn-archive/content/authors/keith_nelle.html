After graduating from San Diego State in 2006 with a degree in Social Sciences, Keith Nelle worked as a finance and insurance advisor in his hometown of San Diego, California.  Keith spent well over a year in the field, and soon realized this was not the path that would define his future.

Shortly after leaving his firm, Keith left the United States and landed in Europe, where he traveled and explored different cultures and lifestyles for almost a year.  An avid freelance writer, Keith returned to the states to continue his post-graduate studies, and will return to San Diego State to pursue a career in teaching.
