Tisha Casida believes in individual sovereignty, protecting property rights, and holding the federal government accountable to the Constitution of the United States of America.  

She has worked for eight years as an entrepreneur engaging in creating wealth by educating people through marketing, advertising, and promotions.  She is a stanch advocate for food and medicine freedom (www.thatsnatural.info).

She is a former and current Independent candidate for Colorado's Congressional District Three (www.casida2014.com) and a firm believer protecting individuals, farmers, and small business owners by making sure that important decisions affecting them can be made at the State and local level of government where the actions of government are more transparent and "officials" are easier to hold accountable.

She was recently made chair of the Blue Republican Colorado chapter, and continues to advocate for Americans to be liberty-curious and have sound and peaceful discussions about liberty, constitutional government, and sound currency (www.bluerepublican.org).
