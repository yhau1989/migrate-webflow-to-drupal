Redante has been a blogger since 2003 as the "Liberal Arts Dude." He retired from blogging in 2010 to concentrate on duties as a new Dad. The call of political writing and blogging proved too hard to resist and he is back writing online for IVN. He mostly writes about third parties, political independents, and activism that challenges the dominance of the two major political parties in the U.S.
