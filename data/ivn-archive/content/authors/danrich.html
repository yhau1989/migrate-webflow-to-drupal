In my younger years I lived a mobile life, traveling to different jobs by choice, building up restaurants and other businesses then getting bored with that place when they started producing a good revenue, and moving somewhere else and doing this all over. Iâ€™ve also spent time with the US Forestry as a Surveyor out of Lufkin, Texas, done a lot of work as a Maintenance Technician until it no long was a profitable job due to illegal workers brought the wages down to where you could no longer survive in this business. I started my own maintenance company when I was twenty-four and made good money until the Texas economic collapse in 1988.
	My life has had a lot of ups and downs, some due to the political scene that affected millions of Americans, and some to situations beyond my control, and some to my own fault, or various combinations. I have learned a lot from real life experiences that have taught me not to believe either of the two political parties, but to rely on facts at hand. This is where I draw my views from, not from either party, although at times I will agree with some aspects, rarely do I agree with the totality of their views.
