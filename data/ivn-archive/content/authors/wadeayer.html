Wade Ayer is a leading patient consumer advocate in the US. His mission is to revolutionize medical laws. These laws are to increase transparency in the surgical suite and the doctor-patient visit. Mr. Ayer is the mastermind behind the "Surgical Black Box" bill, the first of its kind in the United States. It's the right (by law) to have the patient have their surgery recorded by audio video, and to have the doctor-patient consultation recorded by a memory device. Wade Ayer found himself at odds with medical laws after his sister died of medical malpractice and determined that medical laws were unfair. He has gained international attention in the United States, Canada, U.K. and Germany with advocates and lawmakers.
