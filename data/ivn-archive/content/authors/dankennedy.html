an assistant professor at Northeastern University’s School of Journalism, specializing in new-media trends. From 2007-2011 I wrote a weekly online column for The Guardian’s Comment is Free America section, and was a finalist for a Syracuse University Mirror Award in media commentary in both 2008 and 2009. I currently contribute media and political commentaries to the Huffington Post and articles about digital journalism and the future of news to the Nieman Journalism Lab.
