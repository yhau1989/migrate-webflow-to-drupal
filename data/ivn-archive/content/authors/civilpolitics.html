Civil Politics is a non-profit organization that is run by a group of academics whose expertise lies in the use of data to understand moral psychology.  We regularly publish articles in scientific journals concerning the antecedents and consequences of specific moral views.  Our mission is to serve groups and individuals who are trying to bridge moral divisions by connecting them with scientific research in this domain. We do this in three primary ways: 1) Education on scientific research for non-academics  2) Learning from partner organizations  3) Supporting new research.  Our hope in providing this platform is to create a loop between researchers and practitioners, which will enable the evolution of effective, evidence based approaches to improving relations across divisions that have a moral dimension.  While we do not bring people together ourselves, we are hopeful that our work can help some number of interested people and organizations bring people together more effectively.
