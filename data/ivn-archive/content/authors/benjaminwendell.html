For the last twenty-five years I’ve been chief of the radiology department in a small rural hospital in south central Indiana.  My workplace is directly adjacent to several verdant corn fields and nearby to a comprehensive selection of fast food establishments, all specializing in the sorts of menus that guarantee a constant supply of patients to my practice.  I am distinguished mainly by being the last solo radiologist in this quadrant of the Milky Way. 

I’ve been married to the most understanding woman in the world for thirty-seven years, and we’ve raised three sons into productive adulthood, all mensches, not a single felony arrest in the bunch.  We have three wonderful cats, all lacking gonads and front claws, thereby explaining the only conceivable reason PETA hasn’t thus far solicited me to do one of those nude advertising campaigns.

I spent several years writing a weekly community op-ed column for the Bloomington Herald-Times and then came up with the idea for "Left, Right, and Centered", a unique blog modeled after CNN’s “Frontline”.  The concept is two articulate and entertaining writers from opposite sides of the political spectrum conducting an online debate on the issues of the day.  I’m the liberal of the pair, being one of about half a dozen physicians in America without a flag lapel pin and a lifetime membership to the NRA.

I still want to be a writer when I grow up, but that hasn’t happened yet…the growing up part, that is.
