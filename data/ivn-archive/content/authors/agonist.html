I am currently editor of The Agonist, the long-running Left political blog. My blogging began at what is now Newshoggers and I've had the immense pleasure of working with some great writers there and around the web ever since, including at Crooks &amp; Liars. Late 40's, Scottish ex-pat now married to a wonderful Texan with Honours in Philosophy from Univ. of Stirling, UK 1986. Worked most of life in business insurance industry (fire, accident, liability) including 12 years as a broker/underwriter/correspondent at Lloyd's of London. Being from the other side of the pond, my political interests tend to focus on how US foreign policy affects the rest of the planet. Other interests include early and dark-ages British history, literature and cognitive philosophy/science.
