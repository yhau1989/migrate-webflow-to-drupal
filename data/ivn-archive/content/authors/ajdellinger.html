AJ Dellinger is a freelance writer from Madison, Wisconsin. Much of his work focuses on technology and things commonly associated with nerd culture, so AJ brings that same nerd-like passion to politics. Always learning, hopefully educating, and occasionally entertaining. He also writes his own bio in the third person.
