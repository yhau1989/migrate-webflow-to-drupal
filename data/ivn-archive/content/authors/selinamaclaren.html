Selina is a law student at the University of Chicago and a graduate of UC Berkeley, where she received a B.A. in Political Economy. Her interest in government stems from internships at the State Department, on the Hill, and for a public defender's office. She spent six months studying in India and has a passion for international travel, but her recent priority destination is her sunny childhood home of SoCal.
