Timothy Troutner is a young thinker who likes to write. He is currently a student particularly interested in economics and politics. Last year, he began blogging about ideas and events on his personal blog. As a contributor at IVN, his intent is to analyze the connection between ideas and current events. He is interested in the struggle between power and liberty in our economy and government. A libertarian, he is deeply concerned with civil liberties, foreign policy, and economic control. Outside politics, he enjoys playing basketball and studying theology.
