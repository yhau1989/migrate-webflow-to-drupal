The Campaign to Fix the Debt is working to build a broad coalition of organizations concerned about the countryâ€™s fiscal future. In order to do so, we are engaging organizations, unions, associations, think tanks, advocates, elected officials and businesses across the political spectrum, representing diverse constituencies.
