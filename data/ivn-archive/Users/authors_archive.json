In the course of both elections, he received the highest number of votes ever cast for a City Council candidate.</p><p></p><p>During his tenure on the City Council, Brian preserved over 11,000 acres in the San Pasqual Valley from development. He secured the opening of State Route 56 and made numerous infrastructure improvements throughout his district.

Brian and his staff walked the burned-out neighborhood streets themselves to create a list of the homes that had been destroyed and got this news out to his constituents before they were allowed to return. In the fire’s aftermath, he set up a one-stop shop for disaster victims to lead the rebuilding efforts. The plan he created is now viewed as a national model for disaster response.</p><p></p><p>Prior to serving on the City Council, Brian was the Executive Director of Youth Court, an innovative program that has forged a partnership between law enforcement, schools, and community groups to get first-time juvenile offenders back on track. For his work with the program, Brian received the District Attorney’s Crime Victims Rights Award. As a Councilmember, he expanded the program throughout San Diego. Thousands of San Diego students have now been through the program.</p><p></p><p>In recognition of his hard work on behalf of our community, Maienschein received the 2003 Legislator of the Year Award by the American Planning Association. He has also been named one of the Top 50 People to Watch in San Diego by San Diego Magazine and was the recipient of the Top 40 under 40 Leadership Award by San Diego Metropolitan Magazine.

I grew up and went to school in a town that leaned heavily one way politically, and attended a church that leaned in the opposite direction. I met alot of people and made alot of friends from both worlds, but I never felt too passionate to join either of their sides. When the 2012 election coverage began I watched in amazement as my Facebook and Twitter feeds exploded with the agressive firefight of political warfare. During the debates I could watch one of my friends post a shining decleration of praise for one candidate's masterfull answering of a question, and then watch another friend attack the same candidate for being slimey and evasive. It was all quite comical but it made me think about and appreciate the fact that I wasn't directly tied to either side. Most people think being an Independent is being too lazy to vote in a primary; but in actuallity being an Independant means being able to analyze the people, policies, and practices of government while being \"unplugged\" from the Matrix of political dogma. The role of the Independants in our viscously competative political system is to champion the causes of compromise and empathy over competition and agression. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a passionate member of a political party, but Independants exist to keep that passion in check less it give way to something more destructive.</p></div>"

Juan attended the University of San Diego on scholarship, graduated Magna Cum Laude and received a B.A. in Political Science in 1983.  In 1987, Juan earned a Master of Humanities from Fordham University in New York City and in 1991 earned a Juris Doctorate from Harvard Law School, where he was classmates with President Barack Obama.</p><p></p><p>As a young adult, Juan entered the Jesuits, a Catholic religious order, where he worked with disadvantaged communities, including orphaned children and internally displaced people in the jungles of El Salvador. For years, his work with the Jesuits focused on the health and welfare of children and issues of social justice.</p><p></p><p>Juan left the Jesuits in order to pursue family life. Two years later, he married Adrienne D'Ascoli and they returned to San Diego where Juan worked as an associate attorney with the law firm of Luce, Forward, Hamilton and Scripps. Although he enjoyed the practice of law, Juan decided to contribute to his community in southern San Diego as a public official.</p><p></p><p>Juan was elected to the San Diego City Council on February 16, 1993. On the Council, he assumed a leadership role in planning, funding, and advocating for public safety, municipal infrastructure and schools.  During his eight-year tenure on the San Diego City Council Juan helped establish community-based policing, which has become a national model, fought tobacco advertising directed at children, and helped create the City of San Diego' s 6-to-6 after-school program. He also sponsored a graffiti and home rehabilitation program, known as Operation Restore, which employed homeless individuals in an effort to improve and revitalize blighted homes and neighborhoods in San Diego's urban core.</p><p></p><p>When President Bill Clinton ordered an invasion of Kosovo in 1999 to end a terrifying regime of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ethnic cleansing,Ã¢â‚¬Â Juan and Adrienne answered the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call to duty and took in a refugee Kosovar family into their home for nearly two years.  The family is now thriving and independent, residing in the town of El Cajon.</p><p></p><p>In 2000, Juan was elected by a huge margin to the State Assembly. As the State Representative to the 79th California State Assembly District, Juan represented the southern portion of San Diego, the western portion of Chula Vista, and the cities of Coronado, Imperial Beach, and National City. In his first year as a State Legislator, Juan was appointed Assistant Majority Leader. He expanded his work on children's issues beginning with his authorship of AB 188 - legislation that bans smoking in children's playgrounds and tot lot areas. He also introduced legislation aimed at protecting young children from the harmful effects of graphic sex and violence in arcade video games and co-authored legislation to expand before and after-school programs throughout the State of California.  Juan also authored legislation to mandate life sentences for people who commit violent sex crimes against children, which served as a model for ChelseaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law.</p><p></p><p>Following the end of his term the State Assembly in 2006, Juan went on to serve as Vice President of External Affairs for Safeco Insurance and Vice President of Corporate Legal for Liberty Mutual Group.  Both are home, auto, and small business insurance companies and, under these roles, he helped bring jobs to Southern California communities.</p><p></p><p>In 2010 Juan answered the call to return to public service and was elected to the California State Senate.  He currently represents the 40th California State Senate District, which includes the southern portion of San Diego County, portions of Riverside County, all of Imperial County and CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire US/Mexico border.</p><p></p><p>As a State Senator, Juan continues to work tirelessly to ensure public safety and protect services to the poor and elderly.  He is Chairman of the Banking and Financial Institutions Committee and serves on the following committees: Education; Business, Professions and Economic Development; Public Employment and Retirement; Agriculture; the Joint Committee on Rules; and the Select Committee on Recovery, Reform and Re-Alignment.</p><p></p><p>Juan and his wife, Adrienne, an executive at the San Diego Foundation, live in the community of Golden Hill.

Like all of you I have my own story:  small town boy, big dreams and strong ties to what really matters in life. </p><p></p><p>Born and raised in Lemon Grove, California I attended Monterey Heights Elementary and Palm Junior High School.  Mount Miguel High School in Spring Valley was my next stop; and after graduating in 1976, I headed off to Southwestern College in Chula Vista.</p><p></p><p>As with most people, I learned what I needed to in school, and then some.  Football, basketball and track taught me the value of teamwork, but what I did not expect to learn was the value of mentorship. </p><p></p><p>Investing in people, whether as a recipient or giver, is one of the greatest cycles of hope we can participate in. Coaching both the girls and boys basketball teams at Mount Miguel (1977-78 &amp; 1982-83 respectively) provided an avenue for me to give back to my community and encourage the next generation.  Little did I know then how that would transfer to a greater vision for our own state of California.</p><p></p><p>My career at General Dynamics in San Diego included 16 years at the Linbergh Field plant where I moved up the ladder through hard work and commitment.  From commercial aircraft to proto type special projects for the military, missiles and space systems to my managerial experience at Boeing Satellite Systems for the past 15 years: my experience is now your experience as I pour and utilize all that I have learned back into you as your state representative.</p><p></p><p>The traditional family values I hold strong are founded on my faith in God, and my parents own example of 62 years of marriage.  My wife, Candette, and I hold to these same family values and are committed to live out such an example as my own mom and dad.  We attend church at Vista Christian Fellowship in Vista, California and are blessed by our church family.  My faith in God is my strength, guidance and moral compass.</p><p></p><p>As all small town boys do, I grew up.  The years have brought experiences I never imagined, both joys and sorrows, but the essence of</p><p>Matthew James Mendoza has not changed.  Commitment, leadership, courage, strength, and character are all qualities we glean from our foundational core; all of which are intertwined with all of you, my community.</p></div>"

Mr. Stoker served as the Majority Counsel to the Republican Party in Congress where he was assigned to the Government Reform &amp; Oversight Committee. In June of 1995 Stoker was appointed by Governor Pete Wilson, Chairman of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board where he served until 2000. Stoker also serves on the Agricultural Advisory Board to Superintendent of Public Instruction, Mr. Jack O’Connell.

I strongly believe that an Open Primary over a couple of election cycles will lead to more mainstream Republicans, Democrats and Declined to States getting elected who will be more pro-business, pro-pension reform and pro-budget reform which will be a huge advantage to moving California forward and breaking the current grid lock creating a dysfunctional state government.</p><p></p><p>I am also the only candidate supporting Democrat Governor Jerry Brown's Pension Reform proposal. My two Democrat opponents are opposed. I look forward to working in a bi-partisan way with the Governor to pass Pension Reform. I am the only candidate focusing on Budget Reform and Regulatory Reform to help make California more business friendly. My opponents want to spend their time talking about \"special interests\" and \"campaign contributions.\" So much is at stake for California in this election. I think all voters, but especially those that have chosen \"No Party Preference\" or are undecided want a real discussion of the real issues and offering up some real solutions to move California forward. I have done just that since the day I announced my candidacy and will continue talking about the issues the voters care about until Election Day.</p></div>"

In the Assembly, Tony quickly established a reputation as a taxpayer advocate and a representative with the skills to reach independent solutions to make government more accountable. He championed policies to help the economy. He received an Ã¢â‚¬Å“AÃ¢â‚¬Â grade from the Chamber of Commerce for legislation he authored and votes he cast to help create better, higher-paying jobs.</p><p></p><p>As a long time advocate for working California families, it was in the State Assembly that Strickland took the action he is perhaps best known for. He filed a law suit against then-Governor Gray Davis on behalf of energy rate-payers, which ultimately forced the Davis Administration to reveal outrageously expensive energy contracts it had negotiated in secret between the State of California and energy companies.</p><p></p><p>An active member of his community, Tony has been a Board Member of the Ventura County Council Boy Scouts of America, an Advisory Committee Member of Food Share, and an Honorary Board Member of the Moorpark Boys &amp; Girls Club, in addition to being active in numerous civic, business and church organizations throughout Ventura County.
